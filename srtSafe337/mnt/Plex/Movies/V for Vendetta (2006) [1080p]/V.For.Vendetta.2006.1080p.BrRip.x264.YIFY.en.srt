The 5th of November</font>

2
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:47,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">The gunpowder treason and plot</font>

3
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:50,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know of no reason
Why the gunpowder treason</font>

4
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should ever be forgot</font>

5
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:57,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">But what of the man?</font>

6
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:01,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know his name was Guy Fawkes...</font>

7
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:06,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I know in 1605, he attempted
to blow up the Houses of Parliament.</font>

8
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">But who was he really?</font>

9
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:10,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">What was he like?</font>

10
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:20,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are told to remember
the idea and not the man.</font>

11
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:22,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because a man can fail.</font>

12
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:27,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">He can be caught,
he can be killed and forgotten.</font>

13
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:29,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">But 400 years later...</font>

14
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:32,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">an idea can still change the world.</font>

15
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:37,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have witnessed firsthand
the power of ideas.</font>

16
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:40,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've seen people kill
in the name of them...</font>

17
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">and die defending them.</font>

18
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you cannot kiss an idea...</font>

19
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:51,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">cannot touch it or hold it.</font>

20
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:55,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ideas do not bleed.
They do not feel pain.</font>

21
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:58,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">They do not love.</font>

22
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it is not an idea that I miss.</font>

23
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is a man.</font>

24
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:09,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">A man that made me remember
the 5th of November.</font>

25
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:12,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">A man that I will never forget.</font>

26
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:30,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I read that the former United States
is so desperate for medical supplies...</font>

27
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:35,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">that they have allegedly sent several
containers filled with wheat and tobacco.</font>

28
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:38,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">A gesture, they said, of goodwill.</font>

29
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanna know what I think?</font>

30
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you're listening to my show,
so I will assume you do.</font>

31
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:48,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's high time we let the colonies know
what we really think of them.</font>

32
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:52,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think it's payback time for a tea party
they threw us a few hundred years ago.</font>

33
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:56,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">I say we go down to those docks tonight
and dump that crap...</font>

34
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:59,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">where everything from the
Ulcered Sphincter of Ass-erica belongs!</font>

Who's bloody with me?</font>

36
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you like that?</font>

37
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:09,271

I mean, what else can you say?</font>

38
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:13,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here was a country that had everything,
absolutely everything...</font>

39
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">and now, 20 years later, is what?</font>

40
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:19,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">The world's biggest leper colony. Why?</font>

41
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:21,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">Godlessness.</font>

42
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me say that again.</font>

43
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:24,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">Godlessness.</font>

44
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:28,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">It wasn't the war they started.
It wasn't the plague they created.</font>

45
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was Judgment.</font>

46
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:35,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one escapes their past.
No one escapes Judgment.</font>

47
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:38,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think he's not up there?</font>

48
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think he's not watching over
this country?</font>

49
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:45,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">How else can you explain it?
He tested us, but we came through.</font>

50
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">We did what we had to do.</font>

51
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:51,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Islington. Enfield.
I was there. I saw it all.</font>

Unity through faith.</font>

thank you very much.</font>

don't you?</font>

76
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:11,560

a very special performance.</font>

135
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">What kind of musician?</font>

136
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">Percussion instruments
are my speciality.</font>

137
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:54,199

the entire orchestra for this event...</font>

138

I should be getting home.</font>

nothing you've ever seen.</font>

you'll return home safely.</font>

143
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,550

could not be asked for.</font>

145

continue to serve you well.</font>

147
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:25,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">But wait. It is to Madame Justice
that I dedicate this concerto...</font>

148
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">in honor of the holiday she seems
to have taken from these parts...</font>

149
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:34,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">and in recognition of the imposter
that stands in her stead.</font>

150
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:38,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me, do you know
what day it is, Evey?</font>

151
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">- November the 4th?
- Not anymore.</font>

152
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:50,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember, remember
The 5th of November</font>

153
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:54,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">The gunpowder treason and plot</font>

154
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:57,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know of no reason
Why the gunpowder treason</font>

155
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:59,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should ever be forgot</font>

156
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:06,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">First, the overture.</font>

157
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

158
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, the strings.</font>

159
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen carefully, can you hear it?</font>

160
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now the brass.</font>

161
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can hear it!</font>

162
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:30,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look outside, Mommy!
They're playing music!</font>

163
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:37,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How do you do that?
- Wait.</font>

164
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:39,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here comes the crescendo!</font>

165
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:49,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">How beautiful, is it not?</font>

166
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:06,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gentlemen, you have had four hours.
You had better have results. Mr. Creedy.</font>

167
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:08,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Bailey area is quarantined.</font>

168
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">All significant witnesses
have been detained.</font>

169
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:11,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good. Mr. Etheridge?</font>

170
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:16,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">A recording device was found wired into
the central emergency-broadcast system.</font>

I never want to hear that again.</font>

173
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:22,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, sir.</font>

174
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:26,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">We also doubled our random sweeps
and are monitoring phone surveillance...</font>

175
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:30,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">indicating a high percentage
of conversation about the explosion.</font>

176
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:32,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Dascomb,
what are we doing about that?</font>

177
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:35,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're calling it
an emergency demolition.</font>

178
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:38,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have spin coverage on the network
and throughout the InterLink.</font>

179
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:42,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Experts have been lined up to testify
against the Bailey's structural integrity.</font>

180
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:46,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want Prothero to speak on
the dangers of these old buildings...</font>

181
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:49,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">and how we must avoid clinging
to the edifice of a decadent past.</font>

182
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:53,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">He should conclude that the New Bailey
will become the symbol of our time...</font>

183
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:56,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the future
that our conviction has rewarded us.</font>

184
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Heyer.</font>

185
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our surveillance cameras captured
several images of the terrorist...</font>

186
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:05,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">though the mask obviously makes
retinal identification impossible.</font>

187
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:10,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">We also managed to get a picture of
the girl that Creedy's men were detaining.</font>

188
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who is she, Mr. Finch?
- Not sure yet, sir.</font>

189
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:15,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But we're working on several leads.
- Anything else?</font>

190
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">We located the fireworks launch...</font>

191
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:20,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">and found traces
of the explosives used at both sites.</font>

192
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:26,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unfortunately it appears that despite
the heavy level of sophistication...</font>

193
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:30,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">these devices were homemade
with over-the-counter chemicals...</font>

194
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">making them very difficult to trace.</font>

195
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:36,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoever he is, chancellor,
he's very good.</font>

196
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:40,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">Spare us your professional annotations,
Mr. Finch. They are irrelevant.</font>

197
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Apologies, chancellor.</font>

198
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gentlemen, this is a test.</font>

199
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">Moments such as these
are matters of faith.</font>

200
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:50,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">To fail is to invite doubt
into everything we believe...</font>

201
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">everything we have fought for.</font>

202
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:57,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doubt will plunge this country back
into chaos, and I will not let that happen.</font>

203
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gentlemen, I want this
terrorist found...</font>

204
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:04,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I want him to understand
what terror really means.</font>

205
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">England prevails.</font>

206

<font color="#FFFFFF">England prevails.</font>

207
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:18,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think people will buy this?
Why not?</font>

208
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:20,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the BTN.</font>

209
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:23,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our job is to report the news,
not fabricate it.</font>

210
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:26,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the government's job.</font>

211
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">On the lighter side of things...</font>

212
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:32,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">seems that the crew responsible for
the demolition of the Old Bailey...</font>

213
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:37,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">wanted to give the old girl a grand,
albeit improvised, sendoff.</font>

214
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:40,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">Although the demolition had been
planned for some time...</font>

00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:43,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">the music and the fireworks were,
according to the crew chief...</font>

216
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:46,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">- ..."definitely not on the schedule."
MAN We'll be right back.</font>

217
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:50,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you believe that load of bollocks?
I mean, there was no bloody demolition.</font>

218
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw it, the whole thing.</font>

219
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:54,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Did you see it?
- No. Last night I was—</font>

220
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:58,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, that's right. You went
to see Daddy Deitrich, didn't you?</font>

221
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">Evey, there you are.</font>

222
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You are still working for me.
- Sorry, Patricia.</font>

223
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need two espressos and three coffees.</font>

224
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:08,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Deitrich is ready for his tea.</font>

225
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't get it.</font>

226
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:15,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why does he wear a Guy Fawkes mask?
Didn't Fawkes try to blow up Parliament?</font>

227
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:20,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not too late.
He's still got another 16 hours.</font>

228
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe he's just getting started.</font>

229
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah?</font>

230
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:28,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. A lead on the girl.</font>

231
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:31,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, don't get me wrong,
I love it. A cow getting crucified.</font>

232
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:34,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's hysterical.
But you'll never get it approved.</font>

233
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:38,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've got to rewrite it, okay?
Gotta go.</font>

234
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:41,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't recall getting stood up
by a more attractive woman.</font>

but there were Fingermen...</font>

239
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:52,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I got scared and went home.</font>

240
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:57,923

I think our curfew will only get worse.</font>

All that been x-rayed?</font>

to set them off, okay?</font>

Marked for Stage 3.</font>

252
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:05,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just put them over there

00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">usually associated
with someone's death...</font>

291
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:15,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">or the end of some awful,
bloody struggle...</font>

292
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">are celebrated with a nice holiday...</font>

293
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought we could mark
this November the 5th...</font>

294
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:23,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">a day that is, sadly,
no longer remembered...</font>

295
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:27,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">by taking time out of our daily lives
to sit down and have a little chat.</font>

296
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:31,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are, of course,
those who do not want us to speak.</font>

297
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:32,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me think, let me think.</font>

298
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:35,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even now, orders are being shouted
into telephones...</font>

299
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:37,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">and men with guns
will soon be on their way.</font>

300
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's Chancellor Sutler.
- Damn it!</font>

301
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:44,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why? Because while the truncheon
may be used in lieu of conversation...</font>

302
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:47,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">words will always
retain their power.</font>

303
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">Words offer the means to meaning...</font>

304
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:53,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">and, for those who will listen,
the enunciation of truth.</font>

305
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:54,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the truth is...</font>

306
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:58,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">there is something terribly wrong
with this country, isn't there?</font>

307
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:01,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">You designed it, wanted it foolproof.
You said every television in London!</font>

308
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:05,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cruelty and injustice,
intolerance and oppression.</font>

309
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:08,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">And where once
you had the freedom to object...</font>

310
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">to think and speak as you saw fit...</font>

311
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">you now have censors and surveillance
coercing your conformity...</font>

312
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:16,464
<font color="#FFFFFF">- ... and soliciting submission.
- Cameras. We need cameras.</font>

313
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:19,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did this happen?
Who's to blame?</font>

314
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:22,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">Certainly there are those
who are more responsible than others.</font>

315
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:24,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">And they will be held accountable.</font>

316
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:28,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">But again, truth be told,
if you're looking for the guilty...</font>

317
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:31,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">you need only look into a mirror.</font>

318
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:33,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know why you did it.</font>

319
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:34,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you were afraid.</font>

320
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:38,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who wouldn't be?
War, terror, disease.</font>

321
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:41,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">There were a myriad of problems
which conspired...</font>

322
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:45,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">to corrupt your reason
and rob you of your common sense.</font>

323
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fear got the best of you.</font>

324
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:51,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">And in your panic, you turned to
the now High Chancellor Adam Sutler.</font>

325
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">He promised you order,
he promised you peace...</font>

326
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:57,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">and all he demanded in return
was your silent, obedient consent.</font>

327
00:20:57,881 --> 00:21:01,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Inspector, they're almost through.
- Last night, I sought to end that silence.</font>

328
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:04,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">Last night,
I destroyed the Old Bailey...</font>

329
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:08,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">to remind this country
of what it has forgotten.</font>

330
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:13,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">More than 400 years ago, a great citizen
wished to imbed the 5th of November...</font>

331
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:15,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">forever in our memory.</font>

332
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:18,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">His hope was to remind the world
that fairness, justice and freedom...</font>

333
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">are more than words.</font>

334
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:22,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">They are perspectives.</font>

335
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:24,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">So if you've seen nothing...</font>

336
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:28,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">if the crimes of this government
remain unknown to you...</font>

337
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:33,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">then I would suggest that you allow
the 5th of November to pass unmarked.</font>

338
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:36,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if you see what I see...</font>

339
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:41,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you feel as I feel,
and if you would seek as I seek...</font>

340
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:44,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">then I ask you to stand beside me,
one year from tonight...</font>

341
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">outside the gates of Parliament.</font>

342
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:49,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">And together, we shall give them
a 5th of November...</font>

343
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:52,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">that shall never, ever be forgot.</font>

344
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:01,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kerosene fog.
He's using our smoke machines.</font>

345
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:02,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cover the exits.</font>

346
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:06,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one gets out.
The rest of you, follow me.</font>

347
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:10,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Left.</font>

348
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:11,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">You go right.</font>

349
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">Spread out.</font>

350
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:24,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't shoot! Please don't shoot!</font>

351
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:27,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold your fire!</font>

352
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">He put masks on all of us.</font>

353
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:36,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus.</font>

354
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't shoot!
Wait!</font>

355
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait!
Hold your fire!</font>

356
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">Freeze! Nobody move!</font>

357
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:47,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you're wearing a mask,
get down on your knees!</font>

358
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:54,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Get their masks off.
Please hurry!</font>

359
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:56,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a bomb in the control booth.</font>

360
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no.</font>

361
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:02,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Get anyone not wearing a mask out.
Yes, sir.</font>

362
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:04,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Marshal, help carry this man.
Sir.</font>

363
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:07,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone else, let's go.</font>

364
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:16,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good God.</font>

365
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:20,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hurry up, you lot! Come on!
Everybody out!</font>

366
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:29,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dascomb.</font>

367
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:33,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you any idea how long
it would take to rebuild this facility?</font>

368
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:36,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you have any idea
what you're doing?</font>

369
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:37,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, wait!</font>

370
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:42,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't shoot me, please!
It's him! It's him!</font>

371
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">On your knees! On your knees!</font>

372
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">MAN 2
Please! Please don't hurt me!</font>

373
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:15,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here we go.</font>

374
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:24,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did it.</font>

375
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">Freeze!</font>

376
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:35,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get your hands on your head.
Do it now or I shoot.</font>

377
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:41,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">I must say that I am rather astonished
by the response time of London's finest.</font>

378
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:44,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hadn't expected you to be
quite so Johnny-on-the-spot.</font>

379
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:47,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were here before you even started.
Bad luck, chummy.</font>

380
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I don't know about that.</font>

381
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:51,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah!</font>

382
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:07,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're interrupting your regular program
to bring you this terrifying report...</font>

383
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:11,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">of a terrorist takeover of Jordan Tower
which ended only moments ago.</font>

384
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:14,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">A psychotic terrorist,
identified only as the letter V...</font>

385
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:19,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">attacked the control booth with
high-powered explosives and weapons...</font>

386
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:23,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">that he used against unarmed civilians
in order to broadcast a message of hate.</font>

387
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:28,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've just received this footage
of a daring police raid.</font>

388
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop!
Stop, stay where you are, or we'll shoot!</font>

389
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay where you are!</font>

390
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:38,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, this is only an initial report...</font>

391
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:42,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">but at this time, it's believed
that during this heroic raid...</font>

392
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:44,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">the terrorist was shot and killed.</font>

393
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:45,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bollocks.</font>

394
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:49,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">Again, from what we've been told
by authorities, the danger is now over.</font>

395
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:51,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">The terrorist is dead.</font>

396
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:58,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right there. What's he thinking?</font>

397
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:01,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is he considering leaving her?</font>

398
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:04,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">After she just saved him?</font>

399
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:09,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a terrorist. You can't expect him
to act like you or me.</font>

400
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:12,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some part of him's human.</font>

401
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:16,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, for better or worse,
she's stuck with him.</font>

402
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:45,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You scared me.
- My apologies.</font>

403
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:48,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are you feeling all right?
- Yes, thank you.</font>

404
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:51,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What is this place?
- It's my home.</font>

405
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:55,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I call it the Shadow Gallery.
- It's beautiful.</font>

406
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:58,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where did you get all this stuff?
- Oh, here and there.</font>

407
00:27:58,134 --> 00:28:01,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Much of it from the vaults of
the Ministry of Objectionable Materials.</font>

408
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You stole them?
- Heavens, no.</font>

409
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:06,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stealing implies ownership.</font>

410
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:09,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't steal from the censor.
I merely reclaimed them.</font>

411
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:11,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">God, if they ever find this place...</font>

412
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:15,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">I suspect if they do, a few bits of art
will be the least of my worries.</font>

413
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:18,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">You mean, after what you've done.</font>

414
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">God, what have I done?</font>

415
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:23,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">I Maced that detective.
Why did I do that?</font>

416
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:26,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You did what you thought was right.
- No, I shouldn't have done that.</font>

417
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:28,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">I must have been out of my mind.</font>

418
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:32,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that what you really think,
or what they'd want you to think?</font>

419
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:34,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I should go.</font>

420
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:36,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">- May I ask where?
- Home. I have to go home.</font>

421
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:37,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're looking for you.</font>

422
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:40,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">If they know where you work,
they know where you live.</font>

423
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:45,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I have friends, I could stay with them.
- I'm afraid that won't work either.</font>

424
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:48,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have to understand, Evey,
I didn't want this for either of us...</font>

425
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:50,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I couldn't see any other way.</font>

426
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:53,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were unconscious
and I had to make a decision.</font>

427
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:57,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I had left you there, right now you'd be
in one of Creedy's interrogation cells.</font>

428
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:01,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'd imprison you, torture you,
and, in all probability, kill you...</font>

429
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:03,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the pursuit of finding me.</font>

430
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:06,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">After what you did,
I couldn't let that happen...</font>

431
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:10,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I picked you up and carried you
to the only place I knew you'd be safe:</font>

432
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:12,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here, to my home.</font>

433
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:16,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">I won't tell anyone, I swear.
You know you can trust me.</font>

434
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:18,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, but I can't take that risk.</font>

435
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:21,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I don't even know where this is.</font>

436
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:24,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know it's underground.
You know the color of the stone.</font>

437
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:28,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That'd be enough for a clever man.
- Are you saying that I have to stay here?</font>

438
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:31,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only until I'm done. After the 5th,
I no longer think it'll matter.</font>

439
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:34,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">You mean a year from now?</font>

440
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:36,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to stay here for a year?</font>

441
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:39,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, Evey.
I didn't know what else to do.</font>

442
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:41,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should've left me alone.</font>

443
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:43,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why didn't you just leave me alone?</font>

444
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Anything else on the parents?
- Yeah, it ain't good.</font>

445
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:51,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">They were interned at Belmarsh.</font>

446
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:53,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, no.
- Yeah.</font>

447
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:57,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">She died in a hunger strike. He died
when the military retook the shed.</font>

448
00:29:57,378 --> 00:30:01,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that ain't the worst of it.
Her brother was at St. Mary's.</font>

449
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:04,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Christ.
- It's nothing but bad luck here.</font>

450
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:07,679

Now we need his.</font>

451
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:30,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">V?</font>

452
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:33,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah. Bonjour, mademoiselle.</font>

453
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:37,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just wanted to apologize
for my reaction last night.</font>

454
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:42,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">I understand what you did for me,
and I want you to know I am grateful.</font>

455
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your hands.</font>

456
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:47,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

457
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:53,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">There, that's better.</font>

458
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:55,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope I didn't put you off
your appetite.</font>

459
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:59,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, please. It's just— Are you all right?
- Yes, yes, yes, I'm fine.</font>

460
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:01,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I ask what happened?</font>

461
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:05,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">There was a fire. A long time ago.</font>

462
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:07,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ancient history, for some.</font>

463
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:09,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not really very good
table conversation.</font>

464
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:12,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, would you care for a cup of tea
with your egg?</font>

465
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:17,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes, thank you. I'm starving, actually.
- Have a seat.</font>

466
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm.</font>

467
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:26,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's delicious.
- Good.</font>

468
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:30,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">God, I haven't had real butter
since I was a little girl.</font>

469
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:31,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where did you get it?</font>

470
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:35,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">A government supply train
on its way to Chancellor Sutler.</font>

471
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:38,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You stole this from Chancellor Sutler?
- Yes.</font>

472
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:40,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're insane.</font>

473
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:44,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">I dare do all that may become a man.
Who dares more is none.</font>

474
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:46,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Macbeth.
- Very good.</font>

475
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:49,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">My mum, she used to
read all his plays to me...</font>

476
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:52,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">and ever since,
I've always wanted to act.</font>

477
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be in plays, movies.</font>

478
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:58,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I was 9, I played Viola
in Twelfth Night. Mum was very proud.</font>

479
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is your mother now?</font>

480
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's dead.</font>

481
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

482
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:09,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I ask about
what you said on the telly?</font>

483
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:10,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Did you mean it?
- Every word.</font>

484
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:15,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">You really think blowing up Parliament's
going to make this country a better place?</font>

485
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:17,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no certainty, only opportunity.</font>

486
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:20,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can be pretty certain
that if anyone does show up...</font>

every one of them.</font>

488

<font color="#FFFFFF">People should not be afraid
of their governments.</font>

489

<font color="#FFFFFF">Governments should be afraid
of their people.</font>

490
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:30,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you'll make that happen
by blowing up a building?</font>

491
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:34,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">The building is a symbol,
as is the act of destroying it.</font>

492
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:36,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">Symbols are given power by people.</font>

493

it's always been for the worse.</font>

00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:53,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll tell you what I know.
I know this is not a man.</font>

498
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:56,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is he?</font>

499
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:58,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">A man does not wear a mask.</font>

500
00:32:58,017 --> 00:33:01,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What is he?
- A man does not threaten civilians.</font>

501
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:05,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's what every gutless,
freedom-hating terrorist is:</font>

507
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:24,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen to me, you bleeding sod,
England prevails because I say it does!</font>

508

delivering a terrorist's ultimatum.</font>

517
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:03,081

527
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:34,529

When we first met, all those years ago.</font>

538
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:21,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, it's too horrific.</font>

539
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:24,955

to those who knew him...</font>

581
00:37:58,067 --> 00:38:00,026

586
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:21,726

587
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:25,260

to do with that?</font>

588

<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, God.
- You're upset.</font>

590
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:32,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm upset?
You just said you killed Lewis Prothero.</font>

591
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:36,187

attacked you. I heard no objection.</font>

597
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:57,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

598
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,810

603
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:17,687

of a detention facility at Larkhill.</font>

604
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:20,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, no good deed goes unpunished.</font>

605
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:24,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think there's a connection
between our boy and Larkhill?</font>

606
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:29,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">It might explain the connection
between him and the Hammond girl.</font>

607
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:33,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">Problem is, I can't find
any other record of it.</font>

608
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:38,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">Larkhill? Larkhill? I cannot recall
that particular facility, inspector.</font>

a detention facility at Larkhill...</font>

611
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:48,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">approximately 10 miles
north of Salisbury.</font>

612

613
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:54,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a matter
of some urgency, major.</font>

614
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:58,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to know if there was anything
different about this facility.</font>

615
00:39:58,145 --> 00:40:00,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, inspector,
I simply cannot recall.</font>

616
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:03,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was there a specific profile
for those being sent there?</font>

617
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:06,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Usual undesirables, I should think.
- But do you know?</font>

618
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:09,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Of course not. I wasn't stationed there.
- Do you know who was?</font>

619
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:13,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">I cannot recall specific names,
but if you look through our records—</font>

622
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:24,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">Before you go further, let me remind you
things were very chaotic back then.</font>

623
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,798

we had back then.</font>

624
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:29,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">We all did what we had to do.</font>

625
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:32,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">And in those circumstances,
we did the best we could.</font>

626
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:36,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's all I have to say about that.</font>

627
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:42,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can do this.</font>

00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:54,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi.</font>

629
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been thinking...</font>

630
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:01,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's something
I want to ask you...</font>

631
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:07,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I don't think you'll understand why
unless you know a few things about me.</font>

632
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:11,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father was a writer.
You would have liked him.</font>

633
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:14,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">He used to say artists used lies
to tell the truth...</font>

634
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:16,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">while politicians used them
to cover the truth up.</font>

635
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:19,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">A man after my own heart.</font>

636
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:21,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">He always told the best stories.</font>

637
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:25,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">Until my brother died.</font>

638
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:30,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was when everything changed.</font>

639
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:34,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">My brother was one of the students
at St. Mary's.</font>

640
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:37,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">After he died,
my parents became political.</font>

641
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:43,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">They protested the war
and the Reclamation.</font>

642
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:46,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">When Sutler was appointed
high chancellor...</font>

643
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">they were at the riot in Leeds.</font>

644
00:41:48,547 --> 00:41:50,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">I watched on the television...</font>

645
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:53,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">thinking I was going
to see my parents killed.</font>

646
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:56,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remember them arguing at night.</font>

647
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:59,849

Dad refused.</font>

648
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:03,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said if we ran away,
they would win.</font>

649
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:04,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">Win, like...</font>

650
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:06,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">it was a game.</font>

00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:29,379

654
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:33,550

656
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:37,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I'm the one that's sorry.</font>

00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:40,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry I'm not a stronger person.</font>

658
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:44,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry I'm not like my parents.
I wish I was...</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">but I am.</font>

662
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:57,323

Believe me, I know it better than most.</font>

663
00:42:57,324 --> 00:43:03,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which is why I wanted to ask, if there is
anything I can do to help make it right...</font>

664
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:05,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">please let me know.</font>

665
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you wish.</font>

666
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:17,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you really think
you'll find something here?</font>

667
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:18,970

electronic records have all been lost.</font>

671
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:39,949

A lot of things went missing back then.</font>

672
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:44,120

<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Evey Hammond. I'm—</font>

721
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:44,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been the prisoner of the terrorist V
for the past several weeks.</font>

722
00:46:44,092 --> 00:46:47,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm telling you that any moment,
he's going to come through that door.</font>

723
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:51,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">I unlocked the window in the room
where Denis told me to get ready.</font>

724
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:53,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wonderful!</font>

725
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:56,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a game I've never played!</font>

726
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:58,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">What a delightful mind you have.</font>

727
00:46:58,148 --> 00:47:00,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope the rest of you
is just as interesting.</font>

728
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:03,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, please, you have to believe me.
- Oh, I do, I do, I do.</font>

729
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:05,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me show you
the firmness of my beliefs.</font>

730
00:47:05,864 --> 00:47:07,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop it! Get off of me!</font>

731
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:09,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seems I've captured
a dangerous terrorist.</font>

732
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:12,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, how best to procure
her confession?</font>

733
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:13,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

734
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:17,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">You little bitch.
You fucking little whore!</font>

735
00:47:19,878 --> 00:47:21,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">V: Reverend.
- Oh, my God.</font>

736
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">She wasn't lying. It is you.</font>

737
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:25,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

738
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:27,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I had to.
V: Evey!</font>

739
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:34,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">And thus I clothe my naked villainy...</font>

740
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:37,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">with old odd ends
stolen forth from holy writ...</font>

741
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:41,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">and seem a saint,
when most I play the devil.</font>

742
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:43,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, please, have mercy.</font>

743
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:45,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, not tonight, Bishop.</font>

744
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:46,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not tonight.</font>

745
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:51,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't do this, I beg of you.</font>

746
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:53,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, then.
Children's hour at the abbey.</font>

747
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:55,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">V: Open your mouth
and stick out your tongue.</font>

748
00:47:55,747 --> 00:47:59,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What the—?
I don't want to die!</font>

749
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:03,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is Surveillance 109.
We have an emergency.</font>

750
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:09,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">Run every name in that file.
I want the whereabouts of all of them.</font>

751
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:10,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Tonight.
- Yes, sir.</font>

752
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:14,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pucker up, here comes the Finger.</font>

753
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:17,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Get going. I'll handle him.</font>

754
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:23,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">Creedy.</font>

755
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:25,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing here?</font>

756
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:29,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">Several prominent party members
have been murdered, chief inspector.</font>

757
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:34,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is no ordinary situation and requires
more than your ordinary attention.</font>

758
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:37,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">The chancellor demanded
my immediate involvement.</font>

759
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:40,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">It'll be hard to investigate
if you're detaining all my witnesses.</font>

760
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:43,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">The security of information
is paramount.</font>

761
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:45,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">In these volatile times...</font>

762
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:48,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">mistakes like Jordan Tower
can no longer be tolerated...</font>

763
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:51,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">if, indeed,
Jordan Tower was an accident.</font>

764
00:48:51,386 --> 00:48:53,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What does that mean?
- Terrorist seems to have...</font>

765
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:56,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">a rather intimate understanding
of our system.</font>

766
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">The chancellor suspects
there might be an informer.</font>

767
00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:02,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you saying I'm under surveillance,
Mr. Creedy?</font>

768
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:04,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">At this time, it would behoove you...</font>

769
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:09,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">to cease any investigation of matters
that have long since passed...</font>

770
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:13,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">and concentrate on the concerns
of our present.</font>

771
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:14,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">You mean Larkhill?</font>

772
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:18,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">Major Wilson is a friend
of the high chancellor.</font>

773
00:49:18,705 --> 00:49:22,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">- His loyalty is not in question.
- But mine is?</font>

774
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:26,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your mother was Irish, wasn't she?</font>

775
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:31,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">Terrible what St. Mary's
did to Ireland, wasn't it?</font>

776
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:33,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been a party member for 27 years.</font>

777
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:36,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I were you, chief inspector...</font>

778
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:38,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd find the terrorist...</font>

779
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:40,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'd find him soon.</font>

780
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:45,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please.</font>

781
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:51,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">Evey? Good God!</font>

782
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:55,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.
I didn't know where else to go.</font>

783
00:49:56,493 --> 00:50:01,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, well, you better come inside
before someone sees you.</font>

784
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:10,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Cheers.
- I know every cop's looking for me.</font>

785
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:13,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know it's horrible of me
to put you in this situation.</font>

786
00:50:13,635 --> 00:50:16,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Evey—
- You could be in terrible trouble.</font>

787
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:17,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">Evey, listen to me.</font>

788
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:24,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">If the government searched my house,
you would be the least of my problems.</font>

789
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:27,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">You trusted me.</font>

790
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:32,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">It would be terrible manners
for me not to trust you.</font>

791
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:46,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.
That's God Save the Queen.</font>

792
00:50:46,793 --> 00:50:49,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">My parents took me to it
when they hung it at Gallery 12.</font>

793
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:53,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I thought Sutler had it destroyed.
- He believes he did.</font>

794
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:56,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cost me more than this house,
but no matter how bad I feel...</font>

795
00:50:56,845 --> 00:50:59,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">it always cheers me up.</font>

796
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:05,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What is that?
- It's a copy of the Koran, 14th century.</font>

797
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:07,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are you a Muslim?
- No, I'm in television.</font>

798
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:09,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">But why would you keep it?</font>

799
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:12,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't have to be Muslim to find
the images beautiful, poetry moving.</font>

800
00:51:12,944 --> 00:51:15,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it worth it?
If they found that here...</font>

801
00:51:15,113 --> 00:51:18,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you,
you'd be the least of my worries.</font>

802
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:19,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, Gordon.</font>

803
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thank you so much.
- It's all right.</font>

804
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:26,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">This whole thing started the night
he blew up the Old Bailey.</font>

805
00:51:26,124 --> 00:51:28,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was on my way here, and...</font>

806
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:29,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah.</font>

807
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:31,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

808
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:38,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see, we are both fugitives
in our own way.</font>

809
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:39,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But—
- You're wondering why...</font>

810
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:42,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">you were invited here to supper
in the first place...</font>

811
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:46,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">if my appetites were
for less conventional fare.</font>

812
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:50,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unfortunately, a man in my position
is expected to entertain...</font>

813
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:53,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">young and attractive ladies
like yourself.</font>

814
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:57,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because in this world,
if I were to invite who I desired...</font>

815
00:51:57,239 --> 00:52:01,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would undoubtedly find myself
without a home, let alone a TV show.</font>

816
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:04,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm sorry.
- Not as sorry as I am.</font>

817
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:07,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">The truth is, after so many years...</font>

818
00:52:07,707 --> 00:52:11,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">you begin to lose
more than just your appetite.</font>

819
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:16,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wear a mask for so long,
you forget who you were beneath it.</font>

820
00:52:16,883 --> 00:52:21,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, chief inspector.
Same basic toxicology as Prothero.</font>

821
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:25,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">You could get these poisons
from any house in London.</font>

822
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:27,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks, Delia.</font>

823
00:52:27,894 --> 00:52:31,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any leads on finding this guy?</font>

824
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:36,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing yet. But there's something else
you can help me with.</font>

825
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:40,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">You started as a botanist, didn't you?</font>

826
00:52:42,033 --> 00:52:44,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's— It's a Scarlet Carson.</font>

827
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:48,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're believed to be extinct.</font>

828
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:52,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">He leaves them at the crime scenes.</font>

829
00:52:52,043 --> 00:52:54,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd appreciate it
if you could have a look at it.</font>

830
00:52:54,462 --> 00:52:57,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any information could be helpful.</font>

831
00:52:57,799 --> 00:52:59,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course.</font>

832
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:02,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me.</font>

833
00:53:02,929 --> 00:53:04,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah?</font>

834
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:07,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just finished
going through the file, inspector.</font>

835
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:08,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">You better get back here.</font>

836
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:10,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, okay.</font>

837
00:53:11,938 --> 00:53:16,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">My God. He's killed them all.
All but one.</font>

838
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:18,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who is she?
Not sure.</font>

839
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:21,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's clearly one of the people
in charge at Larkhill.</font>

840
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:25,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">But after they shut it down,
she disappeared for two years.</font>

841
00:53:25,243 --> 00:53:28,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">Till she applied for an overseas visa,
which was denied.</font>

842
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:29,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">Running away?</font>

843
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:34,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Probably, because after that,
all record of her seems to stop.</font>

844
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:36,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">- She changed her name.
- That's what I'm guessing.</font>

845
00:53:36,963 --> 00:53:40,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">I put a call in to the registry,
but I haven't heard back.</font>

846
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:45,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's late, or early.
- Call them again. I want that name.</font>

847
00:53:55,982 --> 00:53:57,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? Are you sure about that?</font>

848
00:53:57,817 --> 00:53:59,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Thank you.</font>

849
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:03,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dr. Diana Stanton changed her name
to Delia Surridge.</font>

850
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:06,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The coroner?
- Yeah.</font>

851
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:08,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus, I just saw her.</font>

852
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:19,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's you, isn't it?</font>

853
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:22,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You've come to kill me.
V: Yes.</font>

854
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:26,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank God.</font>

855
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:31,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry,
I can't get a response from that number.</font>

856
00:54:31,184 --> 00:54:33,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a problem
with the connection.</font>

857
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:35,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus Christ.</font>

858
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:37,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's there.</font>

859
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:41,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">After what happened,
after what they did...</font>

860
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:44,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought about killing myself.</font>

861
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:50,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I knew that one day
you'd come for me.</font>

862
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:53,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't know what
they were going to do.</font>

863
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:55,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">I swear to you.</font>

864
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:57,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">Read my journal.</font>

865
00:54:57,168 --> 00:55:01,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">What they did was only possible
because of you.</font>

866
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:06,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oppenheimer was able to change
more than the course of a war.</font>

867
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:10,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">He changed the entire course
of human history.</font>

868
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it wrong to hold on
to that kind of hope?</font>

869
00:55:12,934 --> 00:55:16,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have not come
for what you hoped to do.</font>

870
00:55:16,229 --> 00:55:18,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've come for what you did.</font>

871
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:20,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's funny.</font>

872
00:55:21,067 --> 00:55:24,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was given one of your roses today.</font>

873
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:29,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wasn't sure you were the terrorist
until I saw it.</font>

874
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:35,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">What a strange coincidence,
that I should be given one today.</font>

875
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:38,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are no coincidences, Delia.</font>

876
00:55:38,084 --> 00:55:41,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only the illusion of coincidence.</font>

877
00:55:41,212 --> 00:55:43,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have another rose.</font>

878
00:55:44,382 --> 00:55:46,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">And this one is for you.</font>

879
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:57,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're going to kill me now?
- I killed you 10 minutes ago...</font>

880
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">while you slept.</font>

881
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:02,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is there any pain?
- No.</font>

882
00:56:02,817 --> 00:56:04,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

883
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:09,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it meaningless to apologize?</font>

884
00:56:10,158 --> 00:56:11,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never.</font>

885
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:14,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm so sorry.</font>

886
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:37,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn it.</font>

887
00:56:40,271 --> 00:56:43,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">The terrorist obviously
wanted us to have it.</font>

888
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:47,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wanted us to know the story,
or at least a part of it.</font>

889
00:56:47,028 --> 00:56:50,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Am I to understand that you have read
this document, inspector?</font>

890
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:52,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes, sir.
- Has anyone else read it?</font>

891
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:55,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, sir.
- Then let me make this perfectly clear.</font>

892
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:59,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">The contents of this document
are a matter of national security...</font>

893
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:03,460

of several important party members...</font>

894
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:06,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">as well as a blatant violation
of the Articles of Allegiance.</font>

895
00:57:06,881 --> 00:57:09,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">As the authenticity of this document
cannot be verified...</font>

896
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:13,971

created by the terrorist...</font>

897
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:17,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">as easily as it could be the deranged
fantasy of a former party member...</font>

898

<font color="#FFFFFF">who resigned
for psychological reasons.</font>

899
00:57:20,478 --> 00:57:23,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any discussion of this document
or its contents...</font>

900
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:26,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">will be regarded, at the very least,
as an act of sedition...</font>

901
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:28,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">if not a willful act of treason.</font>

902
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:32,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is that understood, Mr. Finch?
- Yes, sir.</font>

903
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:35,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">You would do well, inspector...</font>

904
00:57:35,326 --> 00:57:38,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">to put it out of your mind.</font>

905
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">May 23rd.</font>

906

arrived today...</font>

907
00:57:53,928 --> 00:57:57,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I have to admit
that I'm very excited.</font>

908
00:57:59,934 --> 00:58:03,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">This could be the dawn of a new age.</font>

909
00:58:03,771 --> 00:58:05,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nuclear power is meaningless...</font>

910
00:58:05,857 --> 00:58:09,026

can kill an entire population...</font>

911
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:11,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">and leave its wealth intact.</font>

912
00:58:11,237 --> 00:58:14,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay together!
Come on, move!</font>

913
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:16,867

<font color="#FFFFFF">Commander Prothero toured the lab
with a priest, Father Lilliman...</font>

915
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:24,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">who I was told is here to monitor
for Rules and Rights violations.</font>

916
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:28,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">It made me nervous, but the commander
assured me there wouldn't be a problem.</font>

917

<font color="#FFFFFF">June 2nd.</font>

918
00:58:31,257 --> 00:58:35,177

how they might be helping their country...</font>

919
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:37,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">if they would act any differently.</font>

920
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:41,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're so weak and pathetic.
They never look you in the eye.</font>

921
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:44,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">I find myself hating them.</font>

922

<font color="#FFFFFF">August the 18th.</font>

923

over 75 percent are now deceased.</font>

926
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:05,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is one case that continues
to give me hope.</font>

927
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:10,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">He exhibits none of the immune-system
pathologies the other subjects developed.</font>

928
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:15,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've discovered cellular anomalies in his
blood that I've been unable to categorize.</font>

929
00:59:15,426 --> 00:59:17,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">The mutations seem
to have triggered...</font>

930
00:59:17,428 --> 00:59:21,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">the abnormal development
of basic kinesthesia and reflexes.</font>

931
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:23,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">The subject said
he could no longer remember...</font>

932
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:26,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">who he was or where he was from.</font>

933
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:30,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoever he was,
he is now the key to our dream...</font>

934
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:35,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the hope that all of this
will not have been in vain.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">November the 5th.</font>

936
00:59:39,492 --> 00:59:42,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">It started last night, around midnight.</font>

937
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:47,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">The first explosions tore open
the entire medical section.</font>

938
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:50,711

939
00:59:50,878 --> 00:59:55,090

it could've happened when I saw him.</font>

940
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:57,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">The man from room 5.</font>

941
00:59:57,468 --> 00:59:58,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">He looked at me.</font>

942
00:59:58,886 --> 01:00:02,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not with eyes. There were no eyes.</font>

943
01:00:02,473 --> 01:00:05,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I know he was looking at me
because I felt it.</font>

944
01:00:12,567 --> 01:00:14,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God...</font>

945
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:16,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">what have I done?</font>

946
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:48,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bonjour, mademoiselle.</font>

947
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:50,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is that you're making?</font>

948
01:00:50,229 --> 01:00:52,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">We called it "eggie in the basket."
My mum made them.</font>

949
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:54,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This is weird.
- What?</font>

950
01:00:54,942 --> 01:00:58,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">The first morning I was with him,
he made me eggs just like this.</font>

951
01:00:58,571 --> 01:01:00,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Really?
- I swear.</font>

952
01:01:01,032 --> 01:01:05,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is a strange coincidence.
Although there's an obvious explanation.</font>

953
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:07,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">- There is?
- Yes, Evey.</font>

954
01:01:08,247 --> 01:01:09,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am V.</font>

955
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:12,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">At last you know the truth.</font>

956
01:01:12,043 --> 01:01:13,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're stunned, I know.</font>

957
01:01:13,586 --> 01:01:17,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hard to believe, isn't it, that beneath
this wrinkled, well-fed exterior...</font>

958
01:01:17,423 --> 01:01:22,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">there lies a dangerous killing machine
with a fetish for Fawkesian masks.</font>

959
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:24,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">Viva la revolución.</font>

960
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:26,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is not funny, Gordon.</font>

961
01:01:26,057 --> 01:01:29,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I know.
I'm useless without a studio audience.</font>

962
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:31,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've seen people go to jail
for less than that.</font>

963
01:01:31,646 --> 01:01:34,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course, he was right, wasn't he?</font>

964
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:38,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is something wrong
with this country.</font>

965
01:01:53,167 --> 01:01:54,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">Morning, inspector.</font>

966
01:01:56,462 --> 01:01:58,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're at it early.</font>

967
01:01:59,757 --> 01:02:03,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is something wrong?
You don't look so good, sir.</font>

968
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:14,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanna ask a question, Dominic.</font>

969
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:18,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care if you answer me or not.</font>

970
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:21,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just wanna say this aloud.</font>

971
01:02:22,363 --> 01:02:26,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I need to know that this question
will not leave this office.</font>

972
01:02:26,284 --> 01:02:29,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, of course, inspector, but—</font>

973
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:31,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because of the terrorist?</font>

974
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:33,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

975
01:02:35,084 --> 01:02:38,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, what is it, chief?
What's going on?</font>

976
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:45,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">The question I want to ask
is about St. Mary's...</font>

977
01:02:45,386 --> 01:02:47,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">and Three Waters.</font>

978
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:53,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">The question that's kept me up
for the last 24 hours...</font>

979
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:56,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">the question I have to ask, is:</font>

980
01:02:57,815 --> 01:03:00,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if the worst...</font>

981
01:03:01,402 --> 01:03:05,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">the most horrifying biological attack
in this country's history...</font>

982
01:03:05,156 --> 01:03:08,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">was not the work
of religious extremists?</font>

983
01:03:09,076 --> 01:03:12,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't understand. We know it was.
They were caught. They confessed.</font>

984
01:03:12,914 --> 01:03:15,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">And they were executed. I know.</font>

985
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:18,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">And maybe that's
really what happened.</font>

986
01:03:20,546 --> 01:03:23,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I see this chain of events...</font>

987
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:28,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">these coincidences,
and I have to ask:</font>

988
01:03:28,262 --> 01:03:30,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if that isn't what happened?</font>

989
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:33,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if someone else
unleashed that virus?</font>

990
01:03:33,142 --> 01:03:37,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if someone else
killed all those people?</font>

991
01:03:37,355 --> 01:03:40,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you really wanna know
who it was?</font>

992
01:03:40,691 --> 01:03:42,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure.</font>

993
01:03:42,276 --> 01:03:46,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even if it was someone
working for this government?</font>

994
01:03:46,572 --> 01:03:48,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's my question.</font>

995
01:03:48,574 --> 01:03:51,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">If our own government
was responsible...</font>

996
01:03:51,577 --> 01:03:56,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">for what happened at St. Mary's
and Three Waters...</font>

997
01:03:57,792 --> 01:04:00,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">if our own government
was responsible...</font>

998
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:04,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">for the deaths
of almost 100,000 people...</font>

999
01:04:07,134 --> 01:04:09,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">would you really wanna know?</font>

1000
01:04:09,178 --> 01:04:11,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">This has to be the bloody
coldest March in years.</font>

1001
01:04:11,597 --> 01:04:14,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep talking like that,
we'll lose our party status.</font>

1002
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:16,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're a pack of lying hypocrites!</font>

1003
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:19,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep it down, will you?</font>

1004
01:04:21,816 --> 01:04:25,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Based on random audio sweeps,
I've projected that right now...</font>

1005
01:04:25,236 --> 01:04:29,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">80 percent of the public
believe the terrorist is still alive.</font>

1006
01:04:29,198 --> 01:04:31,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're also showing
a 12-percent increase...</font>

1007
01:04:31,617 --> 01:04:35,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">over last month's positive mention
in all four quadrants.</font>

1008
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:38,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Creedy?
- We're handling it as best we can.</font>

1009
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:41,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Arrests are as high as they've been
since the Reclamation.</font>

1010
01:04:41,669 --> 01:04:45,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want more than arrests.
I want results.</font>

01:04:48,342 --> 01:04:50,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's all this about?
- I'm celebrating.</font>

1012
01:04:50,761 --> 01:04:52,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">Celebrating what?</font>

1013
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:56,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think this could be
the best show we've ever done.</font>

1014
01:04:56,309 --> 01:04:59,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.</font>

1015
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:02,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, we've got an extraordinary
show for you tonight.</font>

1016
01:05:02,815 --> 01:05:06,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not gonna believe it.
As a matter of fact, I don't think I do.</font>

1017
01:05:06,277 --> 01:05:08,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you please give
a very warm welcome...</font>

1018
01:05:08,946 --> 01:05:12,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">to our own Chancellor Adam Sutler!</font>

1019
01:05:16,829 --> 01:05:19,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No way!
- No, it can't be!</font>

1020
01:05:20,249 --> 01:05:23,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">We threw out the censor-approved script
and shot one I wrote this morning.</font>

1021
01:05:23,961 --> 01:05:25,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

1022
01:05:38,059 --> 01:05:39,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chancellor, chancellor, chancellor...</font>

1023
01:05:39,977 --> 01:05:42,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">I understand you've been under
tremendous strain lately...</font>

1024
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:46,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">since the beginning
of this whole terrorism business...</font>

1025
01:05:46,317 --> 01:05:50,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we thought it would be a nice idea
to try and help you relax. Girls?</font>

1026
01:05:55,201 --> 01:05:59,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah! Warm milk.
There's nothing better.</font>

1027
01:05:59,997 --> 01:06:03,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">I understand you enjoy a glass
every night, chancellor.</font>

1028
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:05,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">Since I was a boy.</font>

1029
01:06:06,087 --> 01:06:07,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you're wrong, Mr. Deitrich.</font>

1030
01:06:07,838 --> 01:06:11,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The terrorist was never a concern.
Oh, really?</font>

1031
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:14,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Chancellor, chancellor—
- It's him.</font>

1032
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:17,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you saying that he's not still alive
and active?</font>

1033
01:06:17,598 --> 01:06:20,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">The terrorist has been neutralized.</font>

1034
01:06:21,936 --> 01:06:24,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God! Chancellor, look!</font>

1035
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:26,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">The terrorist!</font>

1036
01:06:27,024 --> 01:06:28,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">The terrorist!</font>

1037
01:06:30,277 --> 01:06:31,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get him!</font>

1038
01:06:34,407 --> 01:06:36,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, dear.</font>

1039
01:06:55,761 --> 01:06:57,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">At last!</font>

1040
01:06:57,471 --> 01:07:01,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now, for all the world to see.</font>

1041
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:03,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's him!</font>

1042
01:07:04,979 --> 01:07:08,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unhand me! I am your chancellor!</font>

1043
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:12,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">How dare you! I am the chancellor!</font>

1044
01:07:13,154 --> 01:07:15,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Imposter!</font>

1045
01:07:21,537 --> 01:07:23,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Soldiers! That man is the terrorist!</font>

1046
01:07:23,914 --> 01:07:27,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I order you to shoot that traitor!
- Liar!</font>

1047
01:07:27,001 --> 01:07:28,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Faker!
- Fraud!</font>

1048
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:30,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ready!
- Aim!</font>

1049
01:07:30,296 --> 01:07:31,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Fire!
- Fire!</font>

1050
01:07:43,601 --> 01:07:45,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are they gonna do, fine us?</font>

1051
01:07:45,811 --> 01:07:49,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">Big deal. We've got
the most-watched show on air.</font>

1052
01:07:49,398 --> 01:07:52,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you're my agent,
that's what I pay you for.</font>

1053
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:53,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">Protect me.</font>

1054
01:07:54,111 --> 01:07:56,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should've hired him
to be my mother.</font>

1055
01:07:56,113 --> 01:07:59,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're mad.
- Either that or I wasn't breast-fed.</font>

1056
01:07:59,033 --> 01:08:02,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is everything a joke to you?
- Only the things that matter.</font>

1057
01:08:02,203 --> 01:08:05,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What if they come after you?
- I tell you what's gonna happen.</font>

1058
01:08:05,623 --> 01:08:08,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll have to make some kind of apology,
do some boring fundraiser.</font>

1059
01:08:08,959 --> 01:08:15,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the meantime, our ratings will go
through the roof. It'll be fine. Trust me.</font>

1060
01:08:21,388 --> 01:08:22,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gordon?</font>

1061
01:08:25,142 --> 01:08:26,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quick, Evey, hide!</font>

1062
01:08:41,909 --> 01:08:45,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not so funny now, is it, funnyman?</font>

1063
01:09:35,629 --> 01:09:37,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gotcha.
- No, no.</font>

1064
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:54,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know why you're here,
Evey Hammond?</font>

1065
01:09:55,065 --> 01:09:56,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please.</font>

1066
01:09:56,483 --> 01:09:59,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've been charged
with three counts of murder...</font>

1067
01:09:59,445 --> 01:10:03,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">the bombing of government property,
conspiracy to commit terrorism...</font>

1068
01:10:03,073 --> 01:10:09,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">treason and sedition, the penalty
for which is death by firing squad.</font>

1069
01:10:09,246 --> 01:10:14,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have one chance,
and only one chance, to save your life.</font>

1070
01:10:14,752 --> 01:10:18,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must tell us the identity
or whereabouts...</font>

1071
01:10:18,964 --> 01:10:20,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">of code name V.</font>

1072
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:24,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">If your information leads
to his capture...</font>

1073
01:10:24,261 --> 01:10:28,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">you will be released
from this facility immediately.</font>

1074
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:30,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you understand
what I'm telling you?</font>

1075
01:10:30,976 --> 01:10:34,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can return to your life,
Miss Hammond.</font>

1076
01:10:35,189 --> 01:10:38,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">All you have to do is cooperate.</font>

1077
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:44,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">Process her.</font>

1078
01:12:51,325 --> 01:12:53,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know there's
no way I can convince you...</font>

1079
01:12:53,827 --> 01:12:56,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">this is not one of their tricks,
but I don't care.</font>

1080
01:12:56,789 --> 01:12:58,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am me.</font>

1081
01:12:58,749 --> 01:13:00,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">My name is Valerie.</font>

1082
01:13:00,667 --> 01:13:05,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think I'll live much longer.
I wanted to tell someone about my life.</font>

1083
01:13:05,881 --> 01:13:10,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the only autobiography
that I will ever write and, God...</font>

1084
01:13:10,761 --> 01:13:13,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm writing it on toilet paper.</font>

1085
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:18,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was born in Nottingham in 1985.</font>

1086
01:13:19,019 --> 01:13:21,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't remember much
of those early years...</font>

1087
01:13:21,563 --> 01:13:23,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I do remember the rain.</font>

1088
01:13:23,982 --> 01:13:26,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">My grandmother owned a farm
in Tottle Brook...</font>

1089
01:13:26,652 --> 01:13:29,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">and she used to tell me
that God was in the rain.</font>

1090
01:13:29,655 --> 01:13:32,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">I passed my 11 Plus
and went to girls' grammar.</font>

1091
01:13:32,658 --> 01:13:35,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was at school
that I met my first girlfriend.</font>

1092
01:13:35,494 --> 01:13:37,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her name was Sarah.</font>

1093
01:13:37,704 --> 01:13:39,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was her wrists.</font>

1094
01:13:39,456 --> 01:13:41,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">They were beautiful.</font>

1095
01:13:43,752 --> 01:13:46,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought we would
love each other forever.</font>

1096
01:13:46,755 --> 01:13:49,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remember our teacher telling us...</font>

1097
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:51,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">that it was an adolescent phase
that people outgrew.</font>

1098
01:13:51,969 --> 01:13:53,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sarah did.</font>

1099
01:13:55,055 --> 01:13:56,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't.</font>

1100
01:13:57,099 --> 01:14:01,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">In 2002, I fell in love
with a girl named Christina.</font>

1101
01:14:01,395 --> 01:14:03,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">That year I came out to my parents.</font>

1102
01:14:04,523 --> 01:14:07,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">I couldn't have done it
without Chris holding my hand.</font>

1103
01:14:07,609 --> 01:14:11,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father wouldn't look at me.
He told me to go and never come back.</font>

1104
01:14:12,948 --> 01:14:15,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">My mother said nothing.</font>

1105
01:14:15,534 --> 01:14:20,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I'd only told them the truth.
Was that so selfish?</font>

1106
01:14:20,122 --> 01:14:24,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our integrity sells for so little,
but it is all we really have.</font>

1107
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:27,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is the very last inch of us.</font>

1108
01:14:27,713 --> 01:14:29,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">But within that inch...</font>

1109
01:14:29,715 --> 01:14:31,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">we are free.</font>

1110
01:14:33,719 --> 01:14:35,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">It ends whenever you want it to.</font>

1111
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:39,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Just tell us where he is.
- I don't know.</font>

1112
01:15:14,635 --> 01:15:17,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd always known
what I wanted to do with my life...</font>

1113
01:15:17,304 --> 01:15:22,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">and in 2015 I starred in my first film,
The Salt Flats.</font>

1114
01:15:23,852 --> 01:15:27,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was the most important role of my life.
Not because of my career...</font>

1115
01:15:27,648 --> 01:15:31,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">but because that
was how I met Ruth.</font>

1116
01:15:31,985 --> 01:15:34,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">The first time we kissed...</font>

1117
01:15:34,279 --> 01:15:39,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew I never wanted to kiss
any other lips but hers again.</font>

1118
01:15:44,957 --> 01:15:47,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">We moved to a small flat
in London together.</font>

1119
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:51,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">She grew Scarlet Carsons for me
in our window box...</font>

1120
01:15:51,505 --> 01:15:54,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">and our place always smelt of roses.</font>

1121
01:15:56,134 --> 01:15:59,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those were the best years of my life.</font>

1122
01:16:02,474 --> 01:16:05,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">But America's war
grew worse and worse...</font>

1123
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:07,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">and eventually came to London.</font>

1124
01:16:07,062 --> 01:16:10,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">The bill proposed by the Undersecretary
for Defense, Adam Sutler...</font>

1125
01:16:10,357 --> 01:16:13,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">to close the remaining tube stations
passed with...</font>

1126
01:16:13,443 --> 01:16:16,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">After that, there were no roses anymore.</font>

1127
01:16:16,905 --> 01:16:18,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not for anyone.</font>

1128
01:16:18,365 --> 01:16:20,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">You won't last much longer.</font>

1129
01:16:20,617 --> 01:16:22,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're gonna die here.</font>

1130
01:16:22,452 --> 01:16:26,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why protect someone
who doesn't give a shit about you?</font>

1131
01:16:36,383 --> 01:16:40,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remember how the meaning
of words began to change.</font>

1132
01:16:40,971 --> 01:16:47,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">How unfamiliar words like "collateral"
and "rendition" became frightening...</font>

1133
01:16:47,102 --> 01:16:52,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">while things like "Norsefire" and the
"Articles of Allegiance" became powerful.</font>

1134
01:16:52,357 --> 01:16:55,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remember how "different"
became dangerous.</font>

1135
01:16:55,986 --> 01:16:58,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">I still don't understand it...</font>

1136
01:16:58,655 --> 01:17:01,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">why they hate us so much.</font>

1137
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:11,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">They took Ruth
while she was out buying food.</font>

1138
01:17:11,877 --> 01:17:15,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never cried so hard in my life.</font>

1139
01:17:16,089 --> 01:17:19,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">It wasn't long till they came for me.</font>

1140
01:17:26,058 --> 01:17:30,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">It seems strange that my life should end
in such a terrible place.</font>

1141
01:17:30,270 --> 01:17:35,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">But for three years,
I had roses and apologized to no one.</font>

1142
01:17:38,528 --> 01:17:40,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">I shall die here.</font>

1143
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:43,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every inch of me shall perish.</font>

1144
01:17:43,992 --> 01:17:45,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every inch...</font>

1145
01:17:46,286 --> 01:17:47,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">but one.</font>

1146
01:17:51,708 --> 01:17:53,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">An inch.</font>

1147
01:17:54,127 --> 01:17:56,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is small, and it is fragile...</font>

1148
01:17:56,922 --> 01:18:00,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it is the only thing
in the world worth having.</font>

1149
01:18:00,717 --> 01:18:06,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">We must never lose it or give it away.
We must never let them take it from us.</font>

1150
01:18:06,598 --> 01:18:11,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope that, whoever you are,
you escape this place.</font>

1151
01:18:11,144 --> 01:18:15,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope that the world turns
and that things get better.</font>

1152
01:18:15,857 --> 01:18:19,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">But what I hope most of all
is that you understand what I mean...</font>

1153
01:18:19,611 --> 01:18:22,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">when I tell you that
even though I do not know you...</font>

1154
01:18:22,989 --> 01:18:25,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">and even though
I may never meet you...</font>

1155
01:18:25,951 --> 01:18:29,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">laugh with you, cry with you...</font>

1156
01:18:29,329 --> 01:18:31,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">or kiss you...</font>

1157
01:18:31,707 --> 01:18:33,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love you.</font>

1158
01:18:33,709 --> 01:18:36,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">With all my heart...</font>

1159
01:18:36,503 --> 01:18:38,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love you.</font>

1160
01:18:40,090 --> 01:18:41,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">Valerie.</font>

1161
01:18:54,229 --> 01:18:55,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm instructed to inform you...</font>

1162
01:18:55,981 --> 01:18:59,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">that you have been convicted
by special tribunal...</font>

1163
01:18:59,109 --> 01:19:02,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">and that unless you are ready
to offer your cooperation...</font>

1164
01:19:02,237 --> 01:19:04,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">you are to be executed.</font>

1165
01:19:04,281 --> 01:19:08,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you understand
what I'm telling you?</font>

1166
01:19:09,077 --> 01:19:12,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes.
- Are you ready to cooperate?</font>

1167
01:19:15,041 --> 01:19:18,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- Very well.</font>

1168
01:19:20,005 --> 01:19:23,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">Escort Miss Hammond
back to her cell.</font>

1169
01:19:23,925 --> 01:19:25,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">Arrange a detail of six men...</font>

1170
01:19:25,594 --> 01:19:30,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">and take her out behind
the chemical shed and shoot her.</font>

1171
01:19:44,529 --> 01:19:46,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's time.</font>

1172
01:19:47,532 --> 01:19:48,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm ready.</font>

1173
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:53,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, all they want
is one little piece of information.</font>

1174
01:19:53,538 --> 01:19:56,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just give them something, anything.</font>

1175
01:19:56,708 --> 01:19:58,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you...</font>

1176
01:19:58,335 --> 01:20:01,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I'd rather die
behind the chemical sheds.</font>

1177
01:20:01,546 --> 01:20:06,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then you have no fear anymore.
You're completely free.</font>

1178
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:13,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

1179
01:21:37,392 --> 01:21:38,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Evey.</font>

1180
01:21:40,437 --> 01:21:41,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">You.</font>

1181
01:21:43,899 --> 01:21:46,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It was you?
- Yeah.</font>

1182
01:21:47,152 --> 01:21:48,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">That wasn't real?</font>

1183
01:21:51,281 --> 01:21:55,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is Gordon—?
- I'm sorry, but Mr. Deitrich's dead.</font>

1184
01:21:55,452 --> 01:21:57,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought they'd arrest him...</font>

1185
01:21:57,037 --> 01:22:00,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">but when they found a Koran
in his house, they had him executed.</font>

1186
01:22:00,957 --> 01:22:02,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God.</font>

1187
01:22:03,168 --> 01:22:08,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Fortunately, I got to you before they did.
- You got to me?</font>

1188
01:22:08,465 --> 01:22:10,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">You did this to me?</font>

1189
01:22:11,885 --> 01:22:13,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">You cut my hair?</font>

1190
01:22:14,971 --> 01:22:16,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">You tortured me?</font>

1191
01:22:17,098 --> 01:22:18,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">You tortured me.</font>

1192
01:22:20,477 --> 01:22:21,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

1193
01:22:22,854 --> 01:22:27,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said you wanted to live without
fear. I wish there'd been an easier way...</font>

1194
01:22:27,484 --> 01:22:29,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">- ... but there wasn't.
- Oh, my God.</font>

1195
01:22:29,694 --> 01:22:32,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you may never forgive me...</font>

1196
01:22:32,197 --> 01:22:34,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">but nor will you understand
how hard it was for me.</font>

1197
01:22:34,991 --> 01:22:38,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every day, I saw in myself
everything you see in me now.</font>

1198
01:22:38,495 --> 01:22:40,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every day, I wanted to end it.</font>

1199
01:22:40,830 --> 01:22:44,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">But each time you refused to give in,
I knew I couldn't.</font>

1200
01:22:44,584 --> 01:22:47,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're sick! You're evil!</font>

1201
01:22:47,963 --> 01:22:51,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">You could have ended it.
You could have given in, but you didn't.</font>

1202
01:22:51,716 --> 01:22:54,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why?
- Leave me alone! I hate you!</font>

1203
01:22:54,302 --> 01:22:58,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's it! See, at first,
I thought it was hate too.</font>

1204
01:22:58,014 --> 01:23:00,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hate was all I knew.
It built my world, imprisoned me...</font>

1205
01:23:00,725 --> 01:23:03,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">taught me how to eat,
how to drink, how to breathe.</font>

1206
01:23:03,395 --> 01:23:07,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought I'd die
with all the hate in my veins.</font>

1207
01:23:07,148 --> 01:23:09,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">But then something happened.</font>

1208
01:23:09,234 --> 01:23:11,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">It happened to me
just as it happened to you.</font>

1209
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:14,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut up! I don't want to hear
your lies!</font>

1210
01:23:14,864 --> 01:23:18,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your own father said
that artists use lies to tell the truth.</font>

1211
01:23:18,785 --> 01:23:20,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I created a lie.</font>

1212
01:23:20,745 --> 01:23:24,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">But because you believed it,
you found something true about yourself.</font>

1213
01:23:24,499 --> 01:23:28,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- What was true in that cell is true now.</font>

1214
01:23:28,044 --> 01:23:31,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">What you felt in there
has nothing to do with me.</font>

1215
01:23:31,297 --> 01:23:33,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't feel anything anymore!</font>

1216
01:23:34,050 --> 01:23:37,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't run from it, Evey.
You've been running all your life.</font>

1217
01:23:38,972 --> 01:23:41,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't... Can't breathe.</font>

1218
01:23:41,307 --> 01:23:45,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">Asthma. When I was little—</font>

1219
01:23:47,772 --> 01:23:49,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen to me, Evey.</font>

1220
01:23:49,983 --> 01:23:53,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">This may be the most important moment
of your life. Commit to it.</font>

1221
01:23:55,155 --> 01:23:59,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">They took your parents from you.
They took your brother from you.</font>

1222
01:23:59,659 --> 01:24:02,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">They put you in a cell
and took everything they could take...</font>

1223
01:24:02,662 --> 01:24:04,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">except your life.</font>

1224
01:24:04,914 --> 01:24:07,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you believed that was all
there was, didn't you?</font>

1225
01:24:07,959 --> 01:24:10,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">The only thing you had left
was your life, but it wasn't.</font>

1226
01:24:10,879 --> 01:24:14,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, please.
- You found something else.</font>

1227
01:24:14,716 --> 01:24:18,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">In that cell, you found something
that mattered more to you than life.</font>

1228
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:22,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">When they threatened to kill you
unless you gave what they wanted...</font>

1229
01:24:22,974 --> 01:24:25,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">you told them you'd rather die.</font>

1230
01:24:25,643 --> 01:24:27,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">You faced your death, Evey.</font>

1231
01:24:27,604 --> 01:24:30,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were calm. You were still.</font>

1232
01:24:30,482 --> 01:24:33,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">Try to feel now what you felt then.</font>

1233
01:24:39,074 --> 01:24:41,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God.</font>

1234
01:24:43,536 --> 01:24:44,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">I felt...</font>

1235
01:24:45,538 --> 01:24:46,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes?</font>

1236
01:24:48,917 --> 01:24:50,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm dizzy.</font>

1237
01:24:50,919 --> 01:24:53,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need air.</font>

1238
01:24:53,171 --> 01:24:56,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, I need to be outside.</font>

1239
01:24:56,591 --> 01:24:58,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a lift.
It'll take us to the roof.</font>

1240
01:25:17,237 --> 01:25:19,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">God is in the rain.</font>

1241
01:26:23,469 --> 01:26:24,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">V.</font>

1242
01:26:25,930 --> 01:26:27,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm leaving.</font>

1243
01:26:29,851 --> 01:26:33,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are 872 songs in here.</font>

1244
01:26:34,314 --> 01:26:37,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've listened to them all,
but I've never danced to any of them.</font>

1245
01:26:37,650 --> 01:26:40,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Did you hear me?
- Yes.</font>

1246
01:26:40,945 --> 01:26:42,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't stay here.</font>

1247
01:26:43,948 --> 01:26:45,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know.</font>

1248
01:26:46,743 --> 01:26:50,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you won't find
any more locked doors here.</font>

1249
01:26:51,164 --> 01:26:53,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought about keeping this...</font>

1250
01:26:53,499 --> 01:26:57,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it didn't seem right,
knowing you wrote it.</font>

1251
01:27:03,009 --> 01:27:04,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't.</font>

1252
01:27:06,596 --> 01:27:10,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">May I show you something
before you go?</font>

1253
01:27:19,484 --> 01:27:22,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">- She was real.
- Yes.</font>

1254
01:27:22,195 --> 01:27:23,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's beautiful.</font>

1255
01:27:25,073 --> 01:27:27,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Did you know her?
- No.</font>

1256
01:27:27,617 --> 01:27:30,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">She wrote the letter
just before she died.</font>

1257
01:27:30,245 --> 01:27:33,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I delivered it to you
as it had been delivered to me.</font>

1258
01:27:33,498 --> 01:27:35,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then it really happened, didn't it?</font>

1259
01:27:35,917 --> 01:27:39,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes.
- You were in the cell next to her.</font>

1260
01:27:41,089 --> 01:27:43,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's what this is all about.</font>

1261
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:47,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're getting back at them
for what they did to her.</font>

1262
01:27:47,553 --> 01:27:51,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And to you.
- What was done to me created me.</font>

1263
01:27:51,015 --> 01:27:53,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a basic principle of the universe...</font>

1264
01:27:53,017 --> 01:27:56,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">that every action will create
an equal and opposing reaction.</font>

1265
01:27:56,145 --> 01:27:57,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that how you see it?</font>

1266
01:27:57,689 --> 01:28:00,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Like an equation?
- What was done to me was monstrous.</font>

1267
01:28:00,316 --> 01:28:02,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">And they created a monster.</font>

1268
01:28:13,037 --> 01:28:16,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do you know where you'll go?
- No.</font>

1269
01:28:17,125 --> 01:28:19,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">That would have scared me before...</font>

1270
01:28:19,919 --> 01:28:22,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I suppose I should thank you.</font>

1271
01:28:22,046 --> 01:28:23,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well...</font>

1272
01:28:33,182 --> 01:28:34,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

1273
01:28:37,353 --> 01:28:38,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goodbye.</font>

1274
01:28:41,149 --> 01:28:42,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">Evey...</font>

1275
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:46,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">may I ask you for something?</font>

1276
01:28:46,988 --> 01:28:51,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I had one wish, I would wish
to see you again, if only once...</font>

1277
01:28:51,993 --> 01:28:53,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">before the 5th.</font>

1278
01:28:56,122 --> 01:28:58,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">- All right.
- Thank you.</font>

1279
01:29:20,813 --> 01:29:23,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chancellor, I know no one
seems to want to discuss this...</font>

1280
01:29:23,733 --> 01:29:26,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">but if we're to be prepared
for any eventuality...</font>

1281
01:29:26,319 --> 01:29:29,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">then it can't be ignored any longer.</font>

1282
01:29:29,405 --> 01:29:34,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">The red report in front of you has been
vetted by several demolition specialists.</font>

1283
01:29:34,118 --> 01:29:35,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, it concludes that...</font>

1284
01:29:35,703 --> 01:29:39,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">the most logical delivery system
for the terrorist to use...</font>

1285
01:29:39,248 --> 01:29:41,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">would be an airborne attack.</font>

1286
01:29:41,834 --> 01:29:43,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">A separate report has been filed...</font>

1287
01:29:43,628 --> 01:29:47,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">suggesting a train, despite the fact
that the tunnels surrounding Parliament...</font>

1288
01:29:47,632 --> 01:29:49,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">have been sealed shut.</font>

1289
01:29:49,384 --> 01:29:51,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who filed that report?</font>

1290
01:29:52,512 --> 01:29:54,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chief Inspector Finch.</font>

1291
01:29:54,263 --> 01:29:57,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you have any evidence
to support this conclusion, Mr. Finch?</font>

1292
01:29:57,350 --> 01:29:59,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, sir. Just a feeling.</font>

1293
01:30:00,061 --> 01:30:02,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I am sure of anything, inspector...</font>

1294
01:30:02,188 --> 01:30:06,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">it is that this government won't survive
if it is to be subject to your feelings.</font>

1295
01:30:06,526 --> 01:30:09,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Dascomb,
what we need right now...</font>

1296
01:30:09,654 --> 01:30:12,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">is a clear message
to the people of this country.</font>

1297
01:30:12,865 --> 01:30:15,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">This message must be read
in every newspaper...</font>

1298
01:30:15,368 --> 01:30:18,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">heard on every radio,

up-and-coming politician.</font>

and a member of the Conservative Party.</font>

has no regard for the political process.</font>

1341
01:33:13,337 --> 01:33:16,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">The more power he attains,
the more obvious his zealotry...</font>

1342
01:33:16,632 --> 01:33:20,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the more aggressive
his supporters become.</font>

1343
01:33:20,136 --> 01:33:25,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eventually, his party launches a special
project in the name of national security.</font>

1344
01:33:25,474 --> 01:33:28,977

for biological weapons...</font>

1345
01:33:28,978 --> 01:33:31,938

to its cost.</font>

1346
01:33:31,939 --> 01:33:35,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">However, the true goal
of this project is power.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Complete and total
hegemonic domination.</font>

1348
01:33:38,779 --> 01:33:41,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">The project, however, ends violently.</font>

1349
01:33:42,742 --> 01:33:45,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the efforts of those involved
are not in vain...</font>

1350

the most terrifying virus you can...</font>

1352
01:33:54,462 --> 01:33:57,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then imagine that you
and you alone have the cure.</font>

1353
01:33:57,673 --> 01:34:02,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if your ultimate goal is power,
how best to use such a weapon?</font>

1354

<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it's at this point in our story
that along comes a spider.</font>

1355
01:34:07,141 --> 01:34:09,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">A man seemingly
without a conscience...</font>

1356

<font color="#FFFFFF">for whom the ends
always justify the means.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">but rather, the country itself.</font>

1359
01:34:17,902 --> 01:34:20,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three targets are chosen
to maximize the effect of the attack:</font>

1360
01:34:20,905 --> 01:34:24,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">A school, a tube station
and a water-treatment plant.</font>

1361
01:34:24,033 --> 01:34:26,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">Several hundred die
within the first few weeks.</font>

1362
01:34:26,786 --> 01:34:29,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three Waters has, in fact,
been contaminated.</font>

1363

its deadly spread.</font>

through the Underground.</font>

1365
01:34:35,544 --> 01:34:38,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fueled by the media,
fear and panic spread quickly...</font>

1366
01:34:38,339 --> 01:34:41,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">fracturing and dividing
the country until, at last...</font>

1367

<font color="#FFFFFF">the true goal comes into view.</font>

1368
01:34:43,719 --> 01:34:45,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">Before the St. Mary's crises...</font>

1369
01:34:45,513 --> 01:34:49,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">no one would've predicted the results
of the election that year. No one.</font>

1370
01:34:49,725 --> 01:34:54,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then not long after the election,
lo and behold, a miracle.</font>

1371
01:34:54,355 --> 01:34:57,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some believed it was the work
of God himself.</font>

1372
01:34:57,066 --> 01:35:00,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it was a pharmaceutical company
controlled by certain party members...</font>

1373
01:35:00,986 --> 01:35:04,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">that made them all obscenely rich.</font>

1374

<font color="#FFFFFF">A year later, several extremists are tried,
found guilty and executed...</font>

to canonize their victims.</font>

1376
01:35:13,082 --> 01:35:18,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the end result,
the true genius of the plan, was the fear.</font>

1377
01:35:18,003 --> 01:35:20,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fear became the ultimate tool
of this government.</font>

1378
01:35:20,506 --> 01:35:23,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">Through it, our politician
was ultimately appointed...</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">to the newly created position
of high chancellor.</font>

1382
01:35:38,691 --> 01:35:42,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. We'd like to take you into
protective custody, Mr. Rookwood.</font>

1383
01:35:42,778 --> 01:35:44,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure you would.</font>

1384
01:35:44,822 --> 01:35:49,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if you want that recording,
you'll do what I tell you to do.</font>

1385
01:35:49,910 --> 01:35:53,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put Creedy under 24-hour surveillance.</font>

1387
01:35:56,083 --> 01:35:57,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll contact you again.</font>

1388
01:35:57,710 --> 01:36:00,003

<font color="#FFFFFF">Rookwood...</font>

1390
01:36:04,633 --> 01:36:07,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">why didn't you
come forward before?</font>

1391
01:36:07,553 --> 01:36:09,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">What were you waiting for?</font>

1392
01:36:09,096 --> 01:36:11,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, for you, inspector.</font>

1393
01:36:11,515 --> 01:36:13,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">I needed you.</font>

1394
01:36:34,205 --> 01:36:36,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">V:
Shh, shh, shh...</font>

1395
01:36:40,544 --> 01:36:42,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's he doing in the dark there?</font>

1396
01:36:42,797 --> 01:36:45,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Creepy Creedy.
Not sure I wanna know.</font>

1397
01:36:45,549 --> 01:36:49,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sutler can no longer trust you,
can he, Mr. Creedy?</font>

1398
01:36:49,261 --> 01:36:51,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we both know why.</font>

1399
01:36:52,097 --> 01:36:54,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">After I destroy Parliament...</font>

1400
01:36:54,642 --> 01:36:58,686

someone else, some other piece of meat.</font>

1401
01:36:58,687 --> 01:37:00,188

1402
01:37:00,189 --> 01:37:02,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">You, Mr. Creedy.</font>

1403
01:37:02,566 --> 01:37:06,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">A man as smart as you
has probably considered this.</font>

1404
01:37:06,195 --> 01:37:10,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">A man as smart as you
probably has a plan.</font>

1405
01:37:10,157 --> 01:37:13,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">That plan is the reason
Sutler no longer trusts you.</font>

1406
01:37:13,494 --> 01:37:16,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the reason why
you're being watched right now...</font>

1407
01:37:16,163 --> 01:37:19,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">why there are eyes and ears
in every room of this house...</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">- ... and a tap on every phone.
- Bollocks.</font>

1409
01:37:21,877 --> 01:37:26,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, a man as smart as you, I think,
knows otherwise.</font>

1410
01:37:26,465 --> 01:37:29,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What do you want?
- Sutler.</font>

1411
01:37:31,095 --> 01:37:33,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come, now, Mr. Creedy,
you knew this was coming.</font>

1412
01:37:33,806 --> 01:37:35,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">You knew that one day
it'd be you or him.</font>

1413
01:37:35,975 --> 01:37:39,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why Sutler's been kept
underground for security purposes.</font>

1414
01:37:39,478 --> 01:37:42,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why there are several
of your men close to Sutler...</font>

1415
01:37:42,815 --> 01:37:46,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">men that can be counted on.
All you have to do is say the word.</font>

1416
01:37:46,777 --> 01:37:50,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What do I get out of this deal?
- Me.</font>

1417
01:37:51,532 --> 01:37:55,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you accept,
put an X on your front door.</font>

1418
01:37:56,829 --> 01:37:58,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why should I trust you?</font>

1419
01:37:58,914 --> 01:38:03,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because it's the only way
you're ever going to stop me.</font>

1420
01:38:10,009 --> 01:38:15,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is not my sword, Mondego,
but your past that disarmed you.</font>

1421
01:38:15,347 --> 01:38:16,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">May we come up?</font>

1422
01:38:18,142 --> 01:38:20,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">You find your own tree.</font>

1423
01:38:31,447 --> 01:38:34,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got Creepy pinned
like a butterfly for weeks.</font>

1424
01:38:34,950 --> 01:38:37,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">Still no word. What's he waiting for?</font>

1425
01:38:40,456 --> 01:38:43,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah? Inspector, it's for you.</font>

1426
01:38:45,586 --> 01:38:47,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah.
Is that Chief Inspector Finch?</font>

1427
01:38:47,713 --> 01:38:49,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It is.
- This is Captain Clark...</font>

1428
01:38:49,673 --> 01:38:51,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">of the 137th Ward at Southend.</font>

1429
01:38:51,967 --> 01:38:53,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We found him.
- Found who?</font>

1430
01:38:53,344 --> 01:38:55,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">William Rookwood,
the one you're looking for.</font>

1431
01:38:55,596 --> 01:38:59,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw your report a couple weeks back,
thought I'd run it through our John Does.</font>

1432
01:38:59,558 --> 01:39:01,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hooked him. Perfect dental match.</font>

1433
01:39:01,685 --> 01:39:05,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">A floater. Fishermen picked him up.
No ID, never solved. Till now, that is.</font>

1434
01:39:05,731 --> 01:39:10,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">- William Rookwood is dead?
- I'd say so. Twenty years now.</font>

1435
01:39:13,030 --> 01:39:14,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goddamn it!</font>

1436
01:39:14,615 --> 01:39:17,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">That son of a bitch sat there...</font>

1437
01:39:17,076 --> 01:39:21,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">and spoon-fed me that bullshit,
and I ate it up!</font>

1438
01:39:21,705 --> 01:39:23,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, what do we do now, inspector?</font>

1439
01:39:23,791 --> 01:39:26,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">We do what we should
have been doing.</font>

1440
01:39:26,919 --> 01:39:28,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">We find him.</font>

1441
01:39:49,984 --> 01:39:52,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every day, gentlemen.</font>

1442
01:39:53,028 --> 01:39:57,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every day that brings us closer
to November...</font>

1443
01:39:57,241 --> 01:40:00,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">every day that man remains free...</font>

1444
01:40:00,369 --> 01:40:02,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">is one more failure.</font>

1445
01:40:03,038 --> 01:40:05,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three hundred and forty-seven days,
gentlemen.</font>

1446
01:40:05,624 --> 01:40:08,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three hundred
and forty-seven failures!</font>

1447
01:40:08,252 --> 01:40:11,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chancellor, we do not have
the adequate force—</font>

1448
01:40:11,046 --> 01:40:14,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are being buried
beneath the avalanche...</font>

1449
01:40:14,258 --> 01:40:17,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">of your inadequacies, Mr. Creedy!</font>

1450
01:40:34,611 --> 01:40:35,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll get it.</font>

1451
01:40:37,114 --> 01:40:39,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Eric Finch?
- Yeah.</font>

1452
01:40:44,288 --> 01:40:45,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bloody hell.</font>

1453
01:40:47,082 --> 01:40:48,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many went out?</font>

1454
01:40:49,585 --> 01:40:50,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">So far we count eight boxcars.</font>

1455
01:40:50,961 --> 01:40:54,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Several hundred thousand, at least.
- Christ.</font>

1456
01:40:55,340 --> 01:40:59,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want anyone caught
with one of those masks arrested!</font>

1457
01:40:59,595 --> 01:41:02,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me the money!
Give me the fucking money!</font>

1458
01:41:02,556 --> 01:41:06,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're under siege here.
The whole city's gone mad.</font>

1459
01:41:06,310 --> 01:41:08,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This is exactly what he wants.
- What?</font>

1460
01:41:08,854 --> 01:41:12,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anarchy in the UK!
- Chaos.</font>

1461
01:41:12,733 --> 01:41:18,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Creedy, I am holding you
personally responsible for this situation.</font>

1462
01:41:20,407 --> 01:41:26,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">The problem is that he knows us
better than we know ourselves.</font>

1463
01:41:26,538 --> 01:41:29,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why I went to Larkhill
last night.</font>

1464
01:41:29,875 --> 01:41:33,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's outside quarantine.
- I had to see it.</font>

1465
01:41:34,963 --> 01:41:37,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">There wasn't much left.</font>

1466
01:41:37,591 --> 01:41:40,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">But when I was there, it was strange.</font>

1467
01:41:40,928 --> 01:41:45,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">I suddenly had this feeling
that everything was connected.</font>

1468
01:41:50,270 --> 01:41:52,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like I could see the whole thing.</font>

1469
01:41:52,231 --> 01:41:58,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">One long chain of events that stretched
all the way back before Larkhill.</font>

1470
01:41:59,154 --> 01:42:03,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">I felt like I could see everything
that had happened...</font>

1471
01:42:08,622 --> 01:42:11,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">and everything that
was going to happen.</font>

1472
01:42:11,250 --> 01:42:13,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, you!</font>

1473
01:42:14,878 --> 01:42:19,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was like a perfect pattern
laid out in front of me...</font>

1474
01:42:20,467 --> 01:42:24,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I realized that
we were all a part of it...</font>

1475
01:42:27,558 --> 01:42:29,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">and all trapped by it.</font>

1476
01:42:36,733 --> 01:42:39,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">So do you know
what's gonna happen?</font>

1477
01:42:39,403 --> 01:42:42,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. It was a feeling.</font>

1478
01:42:44,491 --> 01:42:46,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I can guess.</font>

1479
01:42:48,078 --> 01:42:52,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">With so much chaos,
someone will do something stupid.</font>

1480
01:42:55,919 --> 01:42:57,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">And when they do...</font>

1481
01:42:57,671 --> 01:42:59,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">things will turn nasty.</font>

1482
01:43:14,229 --> 01:43:16,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rioters were arrested in Brixton.</font>

1483
01:43:16,148 --> 01:43:22,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then Sutler will be forced to do
the only thing he knows how to do.</font>

1484
01:43:23,739 --> 01:43:29,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">At which point,
all V needs to do is keep his word.</font>

1485
01:43:30,370 --> 01:43:31,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then...</font>

1486
01:44:35,936 --> 01:44:38,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tonight's your big night.</font>

1487
01:44:39,564 --> 01:44:41,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ready for it?</font>

1488
01:44:43,527 --> 01:44:45,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are we ready for it?</font>

1489
01:45:18,895 --> 01:45:20,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">I missed this song.</font>

1490
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:23,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't think you'd come.</font>

1491
01:45:24,568 --> 01:45:27,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I said I would.
- Ah.</font>

1492
01:45:29,948 --> 01:45:31,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">You look well.</font>

1493
01:45:31,700 --> 01:45:33,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

1494
01:45:34,786 --> 01:45:39,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">May I inquire as to how
you've avoided detection?</font>

1495
01:45:39,499 --> 01:45:43,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">A fake ID works better
than a Guy Fawkes mask.</font>

1496
01:45:44,087 --> 01:45:48,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">I must confess, every time
I heard a siren, I worried about you.</font>

1497
01:45:48,175 --> 01:45:51,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">I worried about myself for a while.</font>

1498
01:45:51,678 --> 01:45:54,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">But then, one day,
I was at a market...</font>

1499
01:45:54,598 --> 01:45:59,852
<font color="#FFFFFF">and a friend, someone I had worked
with at the BTN, got in line behind me.</font>

1500
01:45:59,853 --> 01:46:05,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was so nervous that when the cashier
asked me for my money, I dropped it.</font>

1501
01:46:05,275 --> 01:46:07,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">My friend picked it up...</font>

1502
01:46:07,819 --> 01:46:09,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">and handed it to me.</font>

1503
01:46:10,614 --> 01:46:13,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">She looked at me right in the eyes...</font>

1504
01:46:13,950 --> 01:46:15,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">didn't recognize me.</font>

1505
01:46:18,163 --> 01:46:23,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever you did to me worked better
than I'd have imagined.</font>

1506
01:46:27,214 --> 01:46:29,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a gift for you, Evey...</font>

1507
01:46:29,925 --> 01:46:35,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">but before I give it to you,
I'd like to ask you something.</font>

1508
01:46:35,138 --> 01:46:38,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you dance with me?</font>

1509
01:46:39,142 --> 01:46:42,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now? On the eve of your revolution?</font>

1510
01:46:42,771 --> 01:46:47,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">A revolution without dancing
is a revolution not worth having.</font>

1511
01:46:47,859 --> 01:46:49,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd love to.</font>

1512
01:46:50,570 --> 01:46:53,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tonight, I will speak directly
to these people...</font>

1513
01:46:53,865 --> 01:46:56,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">and make the situation
perfectly clear to them.</font>

1514
01:46:56,451 --> 01:47:02,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">The security of this nation depends
on complete and total compliance.</font>

1515
01:47:02,207 --> 01:47:06,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tonight, any protestor,
any instigator or agitator...</font>

1516
01:47:06,920 --> 01:47:09,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">will be made example of!</font>

1517
01:47:11,925 --> 01:47:15,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chancellor, there is a contingency
that has not been addressed.</font>

1518
01:47:15,053 --> 01:47:17,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what is that, Mr. Dascomb?</font>

1519
01:47:17,055 --> 01:47:19,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Should the terrorist succeed—
- He won't.</font>

1520
01:47:19,433 --> 01:47:23,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">I understand that it is highly unlikely,
but if he does—</font>

1521
01:47:23,186 --> 01:47:27,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">If he does, and something happens
to that building...</font>

1522
01:47:27,065 --> 01:47:30,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">the only thing that will change,
the only difference it will make...</font>

1523
01:47:30,485 --> 01:47:33,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">is that tomorrow morning,
instead of a newspaper...</font>

1524
01:47:33,405 --> 01:47:37,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will be reading
Mr. Creedy's resignation!</font>

1525
01:47:42,122 --> 01:47:46,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've been busy.
They're very scared right now.</font>

1526
01:47:46,418 --> 01:47:50,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard Sutler's going to make
a public statement tonight.</font>

1527
01:47:50,714 --> 01:47:52,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's nearly time.</font>

1528
01:47:52,507 --> 01:47:55,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">The masks were ingenious.</font>

1529
01:47:55,343 --> 01:47:58,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was strange to suddenly see
your face everywhere.</font>

1530
01:47:58,346 --> 01:48:01,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Conceal me what I am,
and be my aid...</font>

1531
01:48:01,641 --> 01:48:05,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">for such disguise as haply
shall become the form of my intent.</font>

1532
01:48:05,228 --> 01:48:08,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">Twelfth Night.
- Viola.</font>

1533
01:48:08,231 --> 01:48:10,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I don't understand.
- What?</font>

1534
01:48:11,109 --> 01:48:14,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">How you can be one of the most
important things that's happened to me...</font>

1535
01:48:14,738 --> 01:48:17,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">and yet I know
almost nothing about you.</font>

1536
01:48:17,282 --> 01:48:20,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know where you were born,
who your parents were...</font>

1537
01:48:20,243 --> 01:48:22,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you had any brothers or sisters.</font>

1538
01:48:22,871 --> 01:48:26,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't even know
what you really look like.</font>

1539
01:48:26,166 --> 01:48:28,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Evey, please.</font>

1540
01:48:29,419 --> 01:48:31,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is a face beneath this mask...</font>

1541
01:48:31,796 --> 01:48:33,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it's not me.</font>

1542
01:48:33,798 --> 01:48:37,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm no more that face than I am
the muscles beneath it...</font>

1543
01:48:37,344 --> 01:48:39,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">or the bones beneath them.</font>

1544
01:48:41,264 --> 01:48:42,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">I understand.</font>

1545
01:48:43,683 --> 01:48:45,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

1546
01:48:46,019 --> 01:48:47,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">There isn't much time.</font>

1547
01:48:47,938 --> 01:48:50,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have something I must give you.</font>

1548
01:48:50,482 --> 01:48:52,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">I went by Parliament.</font>

1549
01:48:52,651 --> 01:48:57,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never seen anything like it.
Tanks, anti-aircraft, infantry.</font>

1550
01:48:58,365 --> 01:49:02,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">Makes you wish that no one
would show up tonight.</font>

1551
01:49:03,286 --> 01:49:06,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if they do,
what do you think will happen?</font>

1552
01:49:06,665 --> 01:49:09,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">What usually happens
when people without guns...</font>

1553
01:49:09,417 --> 01:49:12,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">stand up to people with guns.</font>

1554
01:49:13,380 --> 01:49:14,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pull over here.</font>

1555
01:49:14,589 --> 01:49:21,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've searched these tunnels for weeks.
You think you're gonna find him now?</font>

1556
01:49:21,471 --> 01:49:22,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">Inspector.</font>

1557
01:49:23,682 --> 01:49:26,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all gone wrong, hasn't it?</font>

1558
01:49:34,359 --> 01:49:38,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Underground?
I thought they closed this all down.</font>

1559
01:49:38,321 --> 01:49:39,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">They did.</font>

1560
01:49:39,739 --> 01:49:45,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">It took nearly 10 years to
clear the tracks and lay a bit of my own.</font>

1561
01:49:45,495 --> 01:49:47,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me show you.</font>

1562
01:50:03,179 --> 01:50:05,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">These tracks lead to Parliament.</font>

1563
01:50:05,348 --> 01:50:06,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

1564
01:50:07,475 --> 01:50:09,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then it's really going to happen,
isn't it?</font>

1565
01:50:09,644 --> 01:50:12,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">It will if you want it to.</font>

1566
01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:16,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- This is my gift to you, Evey.</font>

1567
01:50:16,151 --> 01:50:21,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything that I have: my home,
my books, the gallery, this train...</font>

1568
01:50:21,781 --> 01:50:24,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm leaving to you to do with
what you will.</font>

1569
01:50:24,909 --> 01:50:26,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this another trick, V?</font>

1570
01:50:26,494 --> 01:50:30,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No more tricks. No more lies.</font>

1571
01:50:30,999 --> 01:50:32,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only truth.</font>

1572
01:50:33,084 --> 01:50:36,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the truth is, you made me
understand that I was wrong...</font>

1573
01:50:36,755 --> 01:50:41,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">that the choice to pull this lever
is not mine to make.</font>

1574
01:50:41,885 --> 01:50:44,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why?
- Because this world...</font>

1575
01:50:44,804 --> 01:50:50,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">the world that I'm a part of and
that I helped shape, will end tonight.</font>

1576
01:50:50,310 --> 01:50:52,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">And tomorrow,
a different world will begin...</font>

1577
01:50:52,520 --> 01:50:58,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">that different people will shape,
and this choice belongs to them.</font>

1578
01:51:00,612 --> 01:51:02,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are you going?</font>

1579
01:51:02,781 --> 01:51:05,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">The time has come for me
to meet my maker...</font>

1580
01:51:05,283 --> 01:51:08,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">and to repay him in kind
for all that he's done.</font>

1581
01:51:08,787 --> 01:51:11,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">V, wait!
Please, you don't have to do this.</font>

1582
01:51:11,706 --> 01:51:14,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">You could let it go.
We could leave here together.</font>

1583
01:51:14,459 --> 01:51:17,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. You were right about what I am.</font>

is at the end of that tunnel.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">and all that we hold dear...</font>

1592
01:52:11,683 --> 01:52:15,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">faces a grave and terrible threat.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">The area's clean, sir.</font>

1594
01:52:17,689 --> 01:52:21,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">This violent and unparalleled assault
to our security...</font>

1595
01:52:21,609 --> 01:52:23,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">will not go undefended.</font>

1596
01:52:23,570 --> 01:52:24,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is he?</font>

1597
01:52:24,988 --> 01:52:26,196

Penny for the Guy.</font>

1599
01:52:28,533 --> 01:52:33,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our enemy is an insidious one,
seeking to divide us...</font>

1600
01:52:33,121 --> 01:52:37,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">and destroy the very foundation
of our great nation.</font>

1601

<font color="#FFFFFF">I have kept my side of the bargain,
but have you kept yours?</font>

1602
01:52:42,005 --> 01:52:43,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bring him down.</font>

1603
01:52:43,298 --> 01:52:46,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tonight we must remain steadfast.</font>

1604

<font color="#FFFFFF">We must remain determined.</font>

1605
01:52:48,052 --> 01:52:51,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">But most of all,
we must remain united.</font>

1606
01:52:54,517 --> 01:52:58,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those caught tonight
in violation of curfew...</font>

1607
01:52:58,313 --> 01:53:01,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">will be considered in league
with our enemy...</font>

1608
01:53:01,149 --> 01:53:04,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">and prosecuted as a terrorist
without leniency or exception.</font>

1609
01:53:04,569 --> 01:53:06,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to see his face.</font>

1610
01:53:06,237 --> 01:53:09,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tonight I give you
my most solemn vow...</font>

1611
01:53:09,866 --> 01:53:12,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">that justice will be swift...</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">it will be righteous...</font>

1613
01:53:15,079 --> 01:53:17,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it will be without mercy.</font>

01:53:19,542 --> 01:53:21,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God. No.</font>

1615

<font color="#FFFFFF">V:
At last, we finally meet.</font>

1616
01:53:28,301 --> 01:53:30,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have something for you, chancellor.</font>

1617
01:53:30,929 --> 01:53:32,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">A farewell gift.</font>

1618
01:53:32,889 --> 01:53:36,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">For all the things you've done,
for the things you might have done...</font>

1619
01:53:36,684 --> 01:53:40,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">and for the only thing you have left.</font>

1620
01:53:41,064 --> 01:53:42,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goodbye, chancellor.</font>

1621
01:53:43,983 --> 01:53:45,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Creedy.</font>

1622
01:53:47,570 --> 01:53:49,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">Disgusting.</font>

1623
01:54:02,085 --> 01:54:04,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now that's done with...</font>

1624
01:54:04,379 --> 01:54:08,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's time to have a look
at your face.</font>

1625
01:54:08,758 --> 01:54:10,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take off your mask.</font>

1626

No.</font>

1627
01:54:27,235 --> 01:54:29,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Defiant to the end, huh?</font>

1628
01:54:30,864 --> 01:54:34,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">You won't cry like him, will you?
You're not afraid of death.</font>

1629
01:54:34,617 --> 01:54:35,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're like me.</font>

1630
01:54:35,952 --> 01:54:38,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">The only thing you and I
have in common, Mr. Creedy...</font>

1631
01:54:38,746 --> 01:54:41,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">is we're both about to die.</font>

1632
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you imagine
that's gonna happen?</font>

1633
01:54:44,043 --> 01:54:46,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">With my hands around your neck.</font>

1634
01:54:48,506 --> 01:54:49,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bollocks.</font>

1635
01:54:50,758 --> 01:54:53,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you gonna do, huh?</font>

1636
01:54:53,136 --> 01:54:55,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've swept this place.
You've got nothing.</font>

1637
01:54:55,430 --> 01:54:59,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing but your bloody knives
and your fancy karate gimmicks.</font>

1638
01:54:59,976 --> 01:55:01,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have guns.</font>

1639
01:55:01,728 --> 01:55:05,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you have bullets and the hope
that when your guns are empty...</font>

01:55:05,148 --> 01:55:08,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm no longer standing,
because if I am...</font>

01:55:08,151 --> 01:55:10,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">you'll all be dead
before you've reloaded.</font>

01:55:10,570 --> 01:55:12,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's impossible!</font>

01:55:15,158 --> 01:55:16,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kill him.</font>

1644
01:55:40,850 --> 01:55:41,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">My turn.</font>

1645
01:56:53,631 --> 01:56:55,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">Die! Die!</font>

1646
01:56:56,759 --> 01:56:58,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why won't you die?</font>

1647
01:56:59,846 --> 01:57:01,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why won't you die?</font>

1648
01:57:03,057 --> 01:57:06,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">Beneath this mask
there is more than flesh.</font>

1649
01:57:06,352 --> 01:57:10,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">Beneath this mask there is an idea,
Mr. Creedy.</font>

1650
01:57:10,523 --> 01:57:12,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">And ideas are bulletproof.</font>

1651
01:58:04,452 --> 01:58:07,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is perimeter one.
Whitehall is secure. Over.</font>

1652
01:58:07,705 --> 01:58:09,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is General Ackroyd.</font>

1653
01:58:09,415 --> 01:58:11,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep communication tight.</font>

1654
01:58:11,125 --> 01:58:16,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">I won't have this getting any more
bollixed up than it already is.</font>

1655
01:58:18,341 --> 01:58:19,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">V!</font>

1656
01:58:24,263 --> 01:58:26,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God, we have to stop
your bleeding.</font>

1657
01:58:26,974 --> 01:58:31,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, don't.
I'm finished and glad of it.</font>

1658
01:58:31,479 --> 01:58:33,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't say that.</font>

1659
01:58:33,606 --> 01:58:36,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you, only truth.</font>

1660
01:58:39,987 --> 01:58:43,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">For 20 years I sought only this day.</font>

1661
01:58:43,616 --> 01:58:45,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing else existed...</font>

1662
01:58:47,870 --> 01:58:49,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">until I saw you.</font>

1663
01:58:50,998 --> 01:58:53,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then everything changed.</font>

1664
01:58:54,669 --> 01:58:57,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">I fell in love with you, Evey...</font>

1665
01:58:58,172 --> 01:59:01,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">like I no longer believed I could.</font>

1666
01:59:01,509 --> 01:59:04,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">V, I don't want you to die.</font>

1667
01:59:06,764 --> 01:59:10,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the most beautiful thing...</font>

1668
01:59:10,685 --> 01:59:13,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">you could have ever given me.</font>

1669
01:59:20,903 --> 01:59:22,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">V?</font>

1670
01:59:23,531 --> 01:59:24,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">V?</font>

01:59:35,459 --> 01:59:38,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eyes and ears have detected movement
heading to Trafalgar Square.</font>

1672
01:59:38,421 --> 01:59:40,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is perimeter one.
We have enemy contact.</font>

1673
02:00:12,663 --> 02:00:14,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold it. Stop right there.</font>

1674
02:00:18,169 --> 02:00:20,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're Evey Hammond, aren't you?</font>

1675
02:00:27,678 --> 02:00:29,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then it's over?</font>

1676
02:00:29,472 --> 02:00:30,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Almost.</font>

1677
02:00:30,806 --> 02:00:33,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop. Get your hand off that lever.</font>

1678
02:00:35,603 --> 02:00:36,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

1679
02:00:37,480 --> 02:00:40,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enemy is approaching fast.
Requesting orders.</font>

1680
02:00:40,024 --> 02:00:43,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What shall we do?
- No response from Command.</font>

1681
02:00:43,694 --> 02:00:46,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or from Party Leader Creedy.</font>

1682
02:00:46,197 --> 02:00:48,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or from the high chancellor.</font>

1683
02:00:48,407 --> 02:00:50,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you doing this?</font>

1684
02:00:50,159 --> 02:00:52,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Because he was right.
- About what?</font>

1685
02:00:52,703 --> 02:00:58,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">That this country needs more than
a building right now. It needs hope.</font>

1686
02:01:02,255 --> 02:01:05,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bloody hell, stand down! Stand down!</font>

1687
02:01:31,534 --> 02:01:33,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus bloody Christ.</font>

1688
02:01:59,228 --> 02:02:00,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's time.</font>

1689
02:02:21,709 --> 02:02:23,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me...</font>

1690
02:02:24,086 --> 02:02:26,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">do you like music, Mr. Finch?</font>

1691
02:02:46,150 --> 02:02:48,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">That music?</font>

1692
02:02:48,652 --> 02:02:50,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

1693
02:02:50,529 --> 02:02:52,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">His music.</font>

1694
02:03:24,021 --> 02:03:25,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who was he?</font>

1695
02:03:26,857 --> 02:03:28,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was Edmond Dantes.</font>

1696
02:03:30,277 --> 02:03:32,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he was my father...</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">No one will ever forget that night...</font>

1704
02:04:23,497 --> 02:04:26,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">and what it meant for this country.</font>

1705
