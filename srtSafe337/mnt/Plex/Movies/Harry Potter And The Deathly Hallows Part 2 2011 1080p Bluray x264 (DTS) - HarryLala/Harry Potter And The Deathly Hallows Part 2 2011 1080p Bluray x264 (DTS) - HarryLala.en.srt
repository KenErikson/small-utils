1
00:02:33,617 --> 00:02:34,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's beautiful here.</font>

2
00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:39,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was our aunt's.
We used to come here as kids.</font>

3
00:02:41,423 --> 00:02:43,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Order uses it
now as a safe house.</font>

4
00:02:45,346 --> 00:02:46,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's left of us at least.</font>

5
00:02:49,615 --> 00:02:51,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">Muggles think these
things keep evil away.</font>

6
00:02:52,251 --> 00:02:52,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">But they're wrong.</font>

7
00:02:56,094 --> 00:02:57,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to talk to the Goblin.</font>

8
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:10,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">How are you?</font>

9
00:03:13,211 --> 00:03:13,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alive.</font>

10
00:03:20,184 --> 00:03:21,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">You probably don't
remember that you...</font>

11
00:03:21,223 --> 00:03:23,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">That I showed you to your vault,
the first time you came to Gringotts.</font>

12
00:03:25,151 --> 00:03:27,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even amongst Goblins, you are famous
Harry Potter.</font>

13
00:03:32,023 --> 00:03:34,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You buried the elf?
- Yes.</font>

14
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:36,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">And brought me here.</font>

15
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:40,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are...</font>

16
00:03:42,814 --> 00:03:44,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pretty unusual, is it?</font>

17
00:03:52,668 --> 00:03:54,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did you come by the sword?</font>

18
00:03:59,222 --> 00:04:00,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's complicated.</font>

19
00:04:02,854 --> 00:04:05,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why did Bellatrix Lestrange think
it should be in her vault at Gringotts?</font>

20
00:04:07,693 --> 00:04:09,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's complicated.</font>

21
00:04:13,138 --> 00:04:15,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">The sword presented itself to us,
in moment of need.</font>

22
00:04:16,905 --> 00:04:18,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">We didn't steal it.</font>

23
00:04:21,603 --> 00:04:24,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is a sword in Madam Lestrange's
vault identical to this one.</font>

24
00:04:24,972 --> 00:04:26,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it is a fake.</font>

25
00:04:27,253 --> 00:04:28,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was placed there this past summer.</font>

26
00:04:28,717 --> 00:04:30,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">And she never suspected
it was a fake.</font>

27
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">The replica is very convincing.</font>

28
00:04:32,222 --> 00:04:35,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only a goblin would recognize that
this is the true Sword of Gryffindor.</font>

29
00:04:36,448 --> 00:04:37,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who is the acquaintance?</font>

30
00:04:38,491 --> 00:04:39,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">A Hogwarts Professor.</font>

31
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:42,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">As I understand that
he's now Headmaster.</font>

32
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:44,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">Snape.</font>

33
00:04:45,768 --> 00:04:47,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">He put a fake sword
in Bellatrix's vault.</font>

34
00:04:49,045 --> 00:04:49,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

35
00:04:50,311 --> 00:04:53,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are more than a few curious things
in the vaults at Gringotts.</font>

36
00:04:55,543 --> 00:04:57,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">And in Madam Lestrange's
vault as well?</font>

37
00:05:01,236 --> 00:05:02,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps.</font>

38
00:05:04,935 --> 00:05:08,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to get into Gringotts.
Into one of the vaults.</font>

39
00:05:09,064 --> 00:05:11,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It is impossible.
- Alone, yes.</font>

40
00:05:12,051 --> 00:05:13,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">But with you, no.</font>

41
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why should I help you?
- I have gold.</font>

42
00:05:22,757 --> 00:05:23,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lots of it.</font>

43
00:05:24,029 --> 00:05:25,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've no interest in gold.</font>

44
00:05:25,893 --> 00:05:26,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then what?</font>

45
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:32,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">That.</font>

46
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:35,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is my price.</font>

47
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you thinking there's a
Horcrux in Bellatrix's vault?</font>

48
00:05:52,338 --> 00:05:54,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, she was terrified when she
thought we had been in there.</font>

49
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:56,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">She kept asking you,
what else was taken?</font>

50
00:05:57,059 --> 00:05:59,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">I bet you anything, there's Horcrux
in there. Another piece of his soul.</font>

51
00:06:00,089 --> 00:06:03,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's find it, kill it, and we are
one step closer to killing him.</font>

52
00:06:03,247 --> 00:06:04,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what happens when we find it,</font>

53
00:06:05,152 --> 00:06:07,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">How're we supposed to destroy it,
now you're giving the sword to Griphook?</font>

54
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:10,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm still working on that part.</font>

55
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:13,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's weak.</font>

56
00:06:24,169 --> 00:06:24,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who?</font>

57
00:06:27,154 --> 00:06:27,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Ollivander</font>

58
00:06:29,287 --> 00:06:30,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to ask you a few questions.</font>

59
00:06:31,472 --> 00:06:33,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anything, m'boy.
Anything!</font>

60
00:06:35,464 --> 00:06:39,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you mind identifying this wand?
We need to know if it's safe to use.</font>

61
00:06:43,555 --> 00:06:47,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uhh... Walnut</font>

62
00:06:49,233 --> 00:06:50,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dragon Heartstring</font>

63
00:06:52,527 --> 00:06:54,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">12 and three quarter inches.</font>

64
00:06:56,142 --> 00:06:56,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unyie...</font>

65
00:07:00,121 --> 00:07:01,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unyielding.</font>

66
00:07:02,846 --> 00:07:06,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">This belonged to Bellatrix Lestrange.</font>

67
00:07:10,779 --> 00:07:11,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">And this?</font>

68
00:07:15,637 --> 00:07:16,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hawthorn.</font>

69
00:07:18,761 --> 00:07:20,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">An unicorn hair.</font>

70
00:07:21,515 --> 00:07:22,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">10 inches.</font>

71
00:07:23,478 --> 00:07:25,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Reasonably pliant.</font>

72
00:07:29,776 --> 00:07:33,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">This was the wand of Draco Malfoy.</font>

73
00:07:34,992 --> 00:07:35,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was?</font>

74
00:07:36,396 --> 00:07:37,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it not still?</font>

75
00:07:37,716 --> 00:07:40,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, perhaps not.
If you won it from him.</font>

76
00:07:44,134 --> 00:07:46,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">I sense its allegiance has changed.</font>

77
00:07:52,473 --> 00:07:56,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">You talk about wands,
as if they have feelings...</font>

78
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">can think!</font>

79
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:07,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">The wand chooses the wizard, Mr.
Potter.</font>

80
00:08:08,907 --> 00:08:13,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">That much has always been clear to
those of us who've studied wandlore.</font>

81
00:08:15,534 --> 00:08:18,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, what do you know
about the Deathly Hallows?</font>

82
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is rumored there are three.</font>

83
00:08:28,492 --> 00:08:35,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Elder Wand, the Cloak of Invisibility,
to hide you from your enemies...</font>

84
00:08:36,691 --> 00:08:41,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the Resurrection Stone, to bring
back loved ones from the dead.</font>

85
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:46,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">Together,
they make one the Master of Death.</font>

86
00:08:48,139 --> 00:08:54,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">But few,
truly believe that such objects exist.</font>

87
00:08:54,126 --> 00:08:54,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you?</font>

88
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you believe they exist, sir?</font>

89
00:09:00,295 --> 00:09:01,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well...</font>

90
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:07,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see no reason to put
stock into an old wives' tale.</font>

91
00:09:09,071 --> 00:09:09,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're lying!</font>

92
00:09:11,549 --> 00:09:12,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know one exists.</font>

93
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:18,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">You told him about it.
You told him about the Elder Wand...</font>

94
00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:20,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">and where he could go looking for it.</font>

95
00:09:24,803 --> 00:09:26,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">He tortured me.</font>

96
00:09:29,734 --> 00:09:30,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Besides...</font>

97
00:09:32,577 --> 00:09:34,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">I only conveyed rumors.</font>

98
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:37,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's...</font>

99
00:09:39,987 --> 00:09:42,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no telling
whether he will find it.</font>

100
00:09:45,965 --> 00:09:47,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">He has found it, sir.</font>

101
00:09:53,775 --> 00:09:54,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll let you rest.</font>

102
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:00,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's after you, Mr. Potter.</font>

103
00:10:01,065 --> 00:10:03,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">If it's true what you say,</font>

104
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:05,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">that he has the Elder Wand,</font>

105
00:10:08,581 --> 00:10:09,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm afraid,</font>

106
00:10:11,048 --> 00:10:13,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">you really don't stand a chance.</font>

107
00:10:15,334 --> 00:10:17,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I suppose I'll have to kill him,
before he finds me, then.</font>

108
00:10:23,928 --> 00:10:25,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're sure that's hers?</font>

109
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">Positive.</font>

110
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well?</font>

111
00:10:38,144 --> 00:10:39,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do I look?</font>

112
00:10:40,396 --> 00:10:41,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hideous.</font>

113
00:10:42,869 --> 00:10:45,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can give that to Hermione to hold.
Alright, Griphook?</font>

114
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:07,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're relying on you, Griphook.</font>

115
00:11:07,126 --> 00:11:09,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you get us past the
guards into the vault...</font>

116
00:11:09,404 --> 00:11:10,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">The sword's yours.</font>

117
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:24,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">Madam Lestrange.</font>

118
00:11:25,205 --> 00:11:25,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good morning.</font>

119
00:11:28,294 --> 00:11:31,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good morning?
Good morning?</font>

120
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:34,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're Bellatrix Lestrange,
not some school girl!</font>

121
00:11:34,537 --> 00:11:35,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey!
Easy!</font>

122
00:11:37,055 --> 00:11:41,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">If she gives us away, we must swear to
use that sword to slit our own throats.</font>

123
00:11:42,097 --> 00:11:42,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">Understand?</font>

124
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:44,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, he's right.</font>

125
00:11:45,362 --> 00:11:46,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">I speak stupid.</font>

126
00:11:47,725 --> 00:11:50,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.
Let's do it.</font>

127
00:12:55,711 --> 00:12:58,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish to enter my vault.</font>

128
00:13:01,891 --> 00:13:03,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">Identification?</font>

129
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:09,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hardly think that
would be necessary.</font>

130
00:13:12,376 --> 00:13:13,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">Madam Lestrange.</font>

131
00:13:19,515 --> 00:13:21,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't like to be kept waiting.</font>

132
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:22,930
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I know...</i></font>

133
00:13:24,071 --> 00:13:25,351
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>They know she's an impostor.</i></font>

134
00:13:29,078 --> 00:13:30,174
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>They'd be warned.</i></font>

135
00:13:38,756 --> 00:13:39,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry...</font>

136
00:13:40,983 --> 00:13:42,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do we do, Harry?</font>

137
00:13:48,654 --> 00:13:52,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Madam Lestrange,
would you mind presenting your wand?</font>

138
00:13:53,255 --> 00:13:54,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">And why should I do that?</font>

139
00:13:54,757 --> 00:13:59,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the bank's policy! I'm sure you
understand, given current climate.</font>

140
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:03,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! I most certainly
do not understand!</font>

141
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:07,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm afraid, I must insist.</font>

142
00:14:13,116 --> 00:14:13,949
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Imperio!</i></font>

143
00:14:20,591 --> 00:14:22,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very well, Madam Lestrange.</font>

144
00:14:22,999 --> 00:14:24,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you will follow me?</font>

145
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:01,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is that, Griphook?</font>

146
00:15:07,478 --> 00:15:07,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">Griphook!</font>

147
00:15:27,342 --> 00:15:29,091
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Aresto Momentum</i></font>

148
00:15:33,932 --> 00:15:34,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well done, Hermione.</font>

149
00:15:43,565 --> 00:15:45,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh no, you two're like you again.</font>

150
00:15:46,016 --> 00:15:49,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Thief's Downfall,
washes away all enchantments.</font>

151
00:15:50,174 --> 00:15:51,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can be deadly.</font>

152
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:52,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't say.</font>

153
00:15:53,136 --> 00:15:55,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just out of interest,
is there any other way out of here?</font>

154
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:56,752

00:24:02,451 --> 00:24:05,384

Horcruxes, we'll be able to kill him.</font>

00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:08,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">I reckon he'll stop at nothing

to do with her.</font>

00:24:19,509 --> 00:24:20,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to go there, now!</font>

219
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:22,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we can't do that!</font>

we've got to figure it out!</font>

221
00:24:24,512 --> 00:24:27,443

our plans ever actually worked?</font>

all hell breaks loose.</font>

One problem...</font>

we can't just move from the front door!</font>

225
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:40,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we'll go to Hogsmeade,</font>

226
00:24:40,976 --> 00:24:41,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">to Honeydukes.</font>

227
00:24:42,043 --> 00:24:43,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take the secret
passage in the cellar.</font>

228
00:24:44,526 --> 00:24:44,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's...</font>

229
00:24:45,725 --> 00:24:47,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's something wrong with him.</font>

230
00:24:48,023 --> 00:24:49,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like, you know, in the past...</font>

231
00:24:50,318 --> 00:24:52,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've always been able
to follow his thoughts.</font>

232
00:24:52,627 --> 00:24:54,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now everything just
feels disconnected.</font>

233
00:24:55,596 --> 00:24:57,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe it's the Horcruxes.
Maybe he's growing weaker.</font>

234
00:24:57,824 --> 00:24:58,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe he's dying!</font>

235
00:24:59,145 --> 00:24:59,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

236
00:25:00,185 --> 00:25:01,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it's...
it's more like he's wounded.</font>

237
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:04,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">If anything, he feels more dangerous.</font>

238
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Right here. Come on!
- Search everywhere.</font>

239
00:25:56,771 --> 00:25:57,214

240
00:26:17,008 --> 00:26:18,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">Faster!</font>

00:26:31,087 --> 00:26:32,006

what were you thinking, coming here?</font>

248
00:27:29,017 --> 00:27:31,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you any idea
how dangerous it is?</font>

249
00:27:31,398 --> 00:27:34,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're Aberforth,
Dumbledore's brother.</font>

250
00:27:35,736 --> 00:27:37,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's you who I've
been seeing in here.</font>

251
00:27:38,385 --> 00:27:39,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the one who sent Dobby.</font>

252
00:27:40,077 --> 00:27:42,383

- He's dead.</font>

253
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:45,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry to hear it.
I liked that elf.</font>

254
00:27:45,774 --> 00:27:46,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who gave that to you?</font>

255
00:27:47,016 --> 00:27:47,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">The mirror?</font>

256
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mundungus Fletcher, 'bout a year ago.</font>

257
00:27:51,713 --> 00:27:53,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dung had no right selling that to you.
It belongs to...</font>

00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:54,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sirius...</font>

259
00:27:55,615 --> 00:27:56,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Albus told me.</font>

260
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:00,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">He also told me you'd
likely be hacked off,</font>

261
00:28:00,829 --> 00:28:03,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you ever found that I had it.
But, ask yourself;</font>

262
00:28:04,269 --> 00:28:06,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where would you be if I didn't?</font>

263
00:28:10,477 --> 00:28:11,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you have any others much?</font>

264
00:28:11,794 --> 00:28:12,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">From the Order?</font>

265

tonight.</font>

269
00:28:23,533 --> 00:28:24,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dumbledore gave us a job to do.</font>

270
00:28:25,246 --> 00:28:26,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did he now...</font>

271
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:29,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice job?
Easy?</font>

272
00:28:30,173 --> 00:28:31,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've been hunting Horcruxes.</font>

273
00:28:32,897 --> 00:28:34,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we think the last one's inside
the castle.</font>

274
00:28:34,867 --> 00:28:36,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we'll need your help getting in.</font>

275
00:28:36,364 --> 00:28:39,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which job my brother has given you no,
it's a suicide mission.</font>

276
00:28:40,237 --> 00:28:42,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do yourself a favor, boy.
Go home!</font>

277
00:28:42,705 --> 00:28:43,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">Live a little longer.</font>

278
00:28:43,791 --> 00:28:45,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dumbledore trusted
me to see this through.</font>

279
00:28:45,586 --> 00:28:47,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">What makes you think
you can trust him?</font>

280
00:28:48,853 --> 00:28:51,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">What makes you think you can believe
anything my brother told you?</font>

281
00:28:51,616 --> 00:28:52,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">And in all the time you knew him...</font>

282
00:28:53,324 --> 00:28:54,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did he ever mention my name?</font>

283
00:28:56,296 --> 00:28:57,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did he ever mentioned hers?</font>

284
00:28:58,574 --> 00:29:00,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why should he...
- Keep secrets.</font>

285
00:29:00,273 --> 00:29:01,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">You tell me?</font>

286
00:29:03,291 --> 00:29:05,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I trusted him.
- That's a boy's answer.</font>

287
00:29:07,102 --> 00:29:11,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">A boy goes chasing Horcruxes on the word of a
man who wouldn't even tell him where to start.</font>

288
00:29:11,878 --> 00:29:12,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're lying!</font>

289
00:29:13,751 --> 00:29:17,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not just on me, that doesn't matter.
To yourself as well.</font>

290
00:29:17,716 --> 00:29:18,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what a fool does.</font>

291
00:29:19,873 --> 00:29:23,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't strike me as a fool,
Harry Potter!</font>

292
00:29:23,966 --> 00:29:27,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, I'll ask you again,
there must be a reason.</font>

293
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:32,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not interested in what happened
between you and your brother.</font>

294
00:29:34,528 --> 00:29:35,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care that you've given up.</font>

295
00:29:39,204 --> 00:29:40,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">I trusted the man I knew.</font>

296
00:29:44,946 --> 00:29:46,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to get into
the castle tonight.</font>

297
00:29:53,362 --> 00:29:54,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what to do.</font>

298
00:30:02,352 --> 00:30:03,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where've you sent her?</font>

299
00:30:04,743 --> 00:30:05,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll see.</font>

300
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:07,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">Soon enough.</font>

301
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's your sister, Ariana.
Isn't it?</font>

302
00:30:18,281 --> 00:30:19,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">She died very young, didn't she?</font>

303
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:25,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">My brother sacrificed many things,
Mr. Potter.</font>

304
00:30:25,926 --> 00:30:27,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">On his journey to find power.</font>

305
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:29,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">Including Ariana.</font>

306
00:30:31,022 --> 00:30:32,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">And she was devoted to him.</font>

307
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:35,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">He gave her everything,</font>

308
00:30:38,172 --> 00:30:38,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">but time.</font>

309
00:30:41,265 --> 00:30:42,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, Mr. Dumbledore.</font>

310
00:30:50,458 --> 00:30:51,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">He did save our lives twice!</font>

311
00:30:53,501 --> 00:30:54,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kept an eye on us on that mirror.</font>

312
00:30:57,228 --> 00:30:58,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">That doesn't seem like
someone who's given up!</font>

313
00:31:05,445 --> 00:31:06,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's coming back.</font>

314
00:31:08,231 --> 00:31:08,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's that with her?</font>

315
00:31:17,924 --> 00:31:18,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">Neville!</font>

316
00:31:18,825 --> 00:31:20,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How you look...
- Like hell, I reckon.</font>

317
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:22,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is nothing.</font>

318
00:31:23,061 --> 00:31:23,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seamus is worse.</font>

319
00:31:24,756 --> 00:31:25,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Ab!</font>

320
00:31:25,864 --> 00:31:27,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've got a couple
more coming through.</font>

321
00:31:29,709 --> 00:31:31,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't remember this
on the Marauder's Map.</font>

322
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:33,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's because it
never existed till now.</font>

323
00:31:33,745 --> 00:31:36,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">The seven secret passages were sealed
off, before the start of the year.</font>

324
00:31:37,089 --> 00:31:38,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the only way in or out, now.</font>

325
00:31:39,442 --> 00:31:41,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">The grounds are crawled with
Death Eaters and Dementors.</font>

326
00:31:41,936 --> 00:31:43,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">How about Mr. Snape as Headmaster?</font>

327
00:31:43,728 --> 00:31:44,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hardly ever seen.</font>

328
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:46,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the Carrows who's watch out for.</font>

329
00:31:47,102 --> 00:31:47,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carrows?</font>

330
00:31:47,924 --> 00:31:50,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Brother and sister.
Incharge of discipline.</font>

331
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">They like punishment, the Carrows.</font>

332
00:31:52,739 --> 00:31:53,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">They did that to you?</font>

333
00:31:54,092 --> 00:31:54,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

334
00:31:54,943 --> 00:31:57,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">Today's Dark Arts lesson was
practicing the Cruciatus curse.</font>

335
00:31:58,728 --> 00:31:59,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">On first years.</font>

336
00:32:00,795 --> 00:32:01,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">I refused.</font>

337
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:04,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hogwarts has changed.</font>

338
00:32:18,362 --> 00:32:19,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's have a bit of fun, shall we?</font>

339
00:32:26,003 --> 00:32:27,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, listen up you lot!</font>

340
00:32:28,167 --> 00:32:29,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've for you a surprise.</font>

341
00:32:29,178 --> 00:32:30,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">No more Aberforth's cook gonna help.</font>

342
00:32:31,571 --> 00:32:32,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll be surprised if
we can digest that.</font>

343
00:32:35,877 --> 00:32:38,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh my!
- Harry!</font>

344
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:54,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get the word out to Remus and
the others, that Harry is back.</font>

345
00:32:55,314 --> 00:32:56,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, okay!</font>

346
00:32:56,553 --> 00:32:57,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's not kill him
before You-Know-Who does.</font>

347
00:32:57,916 --> 00:33:02,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you read? We've a new weather report.
Lightning has struck. I repeat: Lightning has struck.</font>

348
00:33:02,228 --> 00:33:02,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the fun, Harry?</font>

349
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:09,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

350
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:12,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's something we need to find.</font>

351
00:33:13,477 --> 00:33:15,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something hidden here, in the castle.</font>

352
00:33:15,849 --> 00:33:17,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it may help us to defeat
You-Know-Who.</font>

353
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:21,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Alright, what is it?
- We don't know.</font>

354
00:33:23,686 --> 00:33:25,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where is it?
- We don't know that either.</font>

355
00:33:27,985 --> 00:33:29,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">I realize there's not much to go on.</font>

356
00:33:29,237 --> 00:33:30,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's nothing to go on.</font>

357
00:33:31,181 --> 00:33:33,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think it has something
to do with Ravenclaw.</font>

358
00:33:34,261 --> 00:33:38,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">It'll be small, easily concealed.</font>

359
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyone, any ideas?</font>

360
00:33:43,015 --> 00:33:45,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, there's Rowena
Ravenclaw's lost diadem.</font>

361
00:33:45,556 --> 00:33:46,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, bloody hell!
Here we go!</font>

362
00:33:48,272 --> 00:33:49,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lost diadem of Ravenclaw?</font>

363
00:33:50,918 --> 00:33:52,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hasn't anyone heard of this?</font>

364
00:33:53,248 --> 00:33:54,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's quite famous.</font>

365
00:33:54,869 --> 00:33:56,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. But, Luna, it's lost.</font>

366
00:33:57,064 --> 00:34:00,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">For centuries. There's no person
alive today who's seen it.</font>

367
00:34:01,419 --> 00:34:03,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me, can someone tell
me what bloody diadem is?</font>

368
00:34:03,762 --> 00:34:04,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a sort of crown.</font>

369
00:34:05,364 --> 00:34:06,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, like a tiara.</font>

370
00:34:09,735 --> 00:34:10,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry!</font>

371
00:34:12,023 --> 00:34:12,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, there.</font>

372
00:34:16,772 --> 00:34:19,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">Six months she doesn't see me and
it's like I'm a frankie first-year.</font>

373
00:34:19,993 --> 00:34:20,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm her brother!</font>

374
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:23,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">- She's got lots of them, but she's got only one Harry.
- Shut up, Seamus!</font>

375
00:34:24,438 --> 00:34:25,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it, Ginny?</font>

376
00:34:26,001 --> 00:34:29,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">Snape knows... he knows
that Harry was spotted in Hogsmeade.</font>

377
00:35:09,382 --> 00:35:13,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">Many of you are surely wondering,
why I have summoned you at this hour.</font>

378
00:35:17,189 --> 00:35:19,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's come to my attention,
that earlier this evening...</font>

379
00:35:22,356 --> 00:35:24,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry Potter was
sighted in Hogsmeade.</font>

380
00:35:27,222 --> 00:35:27,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now...</font>

381
00:35:29,094 --> 00:35:30,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">should anyone...</font>

382
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:37,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">student or staff attempt to aid Mr.
Potter?</font>

383
00:35:38,727 --> 00:35:46,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">They will be punished in a manner consistent with
the severity of their transcription, further more...</font>

384
00:35:48,149 --> 00:35:51,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any person found to have
knowledge of these events...</font>

385
00:35:54,107 --> 00:35:57,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">who fails to come forward...</font>

386
00:35:59,063 --> 00:36:06,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">will be treated as equally guilty.</font>

387
00:36:09,677 --> 00:36:10,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">Another...</font>

388
00:36:15,275 --> 00:36:22,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">If anyone in here has any knowledge of
Mr. Potter's movements this evening.</font>

389
00:36:25,939 --> 00:36:28,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">I invite them to step forward.</font>

390
00:36:33,231 --> 00:36:34,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now!</font>

391
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:53,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">It seems, despite your
exhaustive defensive strategies,</font>

392
00:36:53,735 --> 00:36:55,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">you still have a bit of
security problem, Headmaster.</font>

393
00:37:00,004 --> 00:37:01,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm afraid it's quite extensive.</font>

394
00:37:03,498 --> 00:37:05,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">How dare you stand where he stood?</font>

395
00:37:07,384 --> 00:37:11,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell them how it happened that night?
Tell them how you looked him in the eye...</font>

396
00:37:11,529 --> 00:37:13,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">A man who trusted you,
and killed him.</font>

397
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:15,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell them!</font>

398
00:37:41,498 --> 00:37:42,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">COWARD!</font>

399
00:37:51,461 --> 00:37:53,295
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Harry.</i></font>

400
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:55,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">Potter?</font>

401
00:38:30,663 --> 00:38:35,538
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I know that many of
you will want to fight.</i></font>

402
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:41,544
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Some of you may even think
that to fight is wise.</i></font>

403
00:38:41,778 --> 00:38:43,565
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>But this is folly.</i></font>

404
00:38:45,283 --> 00:38:47,860
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Give me Harry Potter.</i></font>

405
00:38:49,157 --> 00:38:52,849
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Do this and none shall be harmed.</i></font>

406
00:38:53,283 --> 00:38:59,512
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Give me Harry Potter,
and I shall leave Hogwarts untouched.</i></font>

407
00:38:59,831 --> 00:39:06,786
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Give me Harry Potter,
and you will be rewarded.</i></font>

408
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:09,596
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>You have one hour.</i></font>

409
00:39:20,188 --> 00:39:23,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">What're you waiting for?
Someone grab him!</font>

410
00:39:32,714 --> 00:39:37,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">Students out of bed!
Students out of bed!</font>

411
00:39:37,871 --> 00:39:39,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Students in the corridor!</font>

412
00:39:39,403 --> 00:39:42,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're supposed to be out of bed,
you blithering idiot!</font>

413
00:39:46,292 --> 00:39:47,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry ma'am.</font>

414
00:39:47,494 --> 00:39:48,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">As it happens, Mr. Filch...</font>

415
00:39:49,106 --> 00:39:50,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your arrival is most opportune.</font>

416
00:39:51,609 --> 00:39:58,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you would, I would like you please, to lead Miss
Parkinson and the rest of Slytherin house, from the hall.</font>

417
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:01,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">Exactly where is it I'll
be leading 'em to, ma'am?</font>

418
00:40:01,212 --> 00:40:02,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">The dungeons would do.</font>

419
00:40:08,553 --> 00:40:10,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">I presume you have a reason
for returning, Potter.</font>

420
00:40:10,955 --> 00:40:12,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it you need?</font>

421
00:40:12,217 --> 00:40:14,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">Time, Professor.
As much as you can get me.</font>

422
00:40:15,641 --> 00:40:16,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do what you have to do.</font>

423
00:40:17,103 --> 00:40:18,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll secure the castle.</font>

424
00:40:20,158 --> 00:40:20,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">Potter...</font>

425
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:24,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's good to see you.</font>

426
00:40:26,325 --> 00:40:27,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's good to see you too, Professor.</font>

427
00:40:29,229 --> 00:40:30,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold the fort, Neville.</font>

428
00:40:42,937 --> 00:40:43,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry!</font>

429
00:40:44,379 --> 00:40:47,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hermione and I've been thinking,
it doesn't matter if we find a Horcrux.</font>

430
00:40:47,743 --> 00:40:48,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you mean?</font>

431
00:40:48,674 --> 00:40:50,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unless we can destroy it.</font>

432
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:51,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, we were thinking...</font>

433
00:40:51,578 --> 00:40:52,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, Ron was thinking,
it was Ron's idea.</font>

434
00:40:53,073 --> 00:40:53,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's completely brilliant.</font>

435
00:40:54,302 --> 00:40:56,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">You destroyed Tom Riddle's diary
with a Basilisk's fang, right?</font>

436
00:40:57,657 --> 00:40:59,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, me and Hermione did remind
where we might find one.</font>

437
00:41:00,096 --> 00:41:00,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

438
00:41:02,062 --> 00:41:03,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, but take this.</font>

439
00:41:03,689 --> 00:41:04,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">That way,
you can find me when you get back.</font>

440
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:06,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where're you going?</font>

441
00:41:06,676 --> 00:41:08,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ravenclaw common room,
Gotta start somewhere.</font>

442
00:41:15,781 --> 00:41:16,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry!</font>

443
00:41:17,682 --> 00:41:18,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry!</font>

444
00:41:19,325 --> 00:41:20,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me get this straight,
Professor...</font>

445
00:41:21,028 --> 00:41:22,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're actually giving us
permission to do this?</font>

446
00:41:22,949 --> 00:41:24,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is correct, Longbottom.</font>

447
00:41:25,223 --> 00:41:26,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">To blow it up!
Boom!</font>

448
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boom!</font>

449
00:41:28,372 --> 00:41:29,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wicked!</font>

450
00:41:29,799 --> 00:41:30,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">But how on earth are
we gonna do that?</font>

451
00:41:31,912 --> 00:41:33,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you confer with Mr.
Finnigan?</font>

452
00:41:34,405 --> 00:41:37,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">As I recall, he has a particular
proclivity for pyro-technics.</font>

453
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:39,116

Filius, you might as well use it.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

501
00:45:24,106 --> 00:45:24,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right.</font>

502
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:28,358

<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, please!</font>

506
00:45:43,533 --> 00:45:45,059

00:46:23,645 --> 00:46:25,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">They never learn.</font>

508
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:28,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">Such a pity.</font>

509
00:46:29,573 --> 00:46:31,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, my Lord...</font>

510
00:46:33,066 --> 00:46:34,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shouldn't we wait?</font>

511
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:36,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">My Lord!</font>

512
00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:43,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Begin!</font>

513
00:47:04,539 --> 00:47:05,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you want to do it.
Isn't it, Helena?</font>

514
00:47:12,369 --> 00:47:13,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to destroy it?</font>

515
00:47:13,811 --> 00:47:16,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">Another swore to destroy it,
many years ago.</font>

516
00:47:17,271 --> 00:47:19,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">A strange boy with a strange name.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Tom Riddle.</font>

518
00:47:21,001 --> 00:47:22,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">But he lied.</font>

519
00:47:22,843 --> 00:47:24,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's lied to many people.</font>

520
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:27,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know what he's done!
I know who he is!</font>

521
00:47:27,735 --> 00:47:30,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">He defiled it, with dark magic!</font>

522
00:47:45,693 --> 00:47:46,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can destroy it.</font>

523
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:48,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once and for all.</font>

524
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:53,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">But only if you tell me
where he hid it?</font>

525
00:47:56,187 --> 00:47:59,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">You do know, where he hid it?</font>

526
00:48:00,097 --> 00:48:00,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you, Helena?</font>

527
00:48:03,567 --> 00:48:04,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just have to tell me.</font>

528
00:48:07,407 --> 00:48:08,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please!</font>

529
00:48:20,978 --> 00:48:22,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Strange!</font>

530
00:48:26,207 --> 00:48:28,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">You remind me of him a bit.</font>

531
00:48:30,411 --> 00:48:33,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's here, in the castle.</font>

532
00:48:34,554 --> 00:48:36,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the place where
everything is hidden.</font>

533
00:48:38,964 --> 00:48:40,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you have to ask...</font>

534
00:48:40,665 --> 00:48:41,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">you will never know.</font>

535
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:44,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you know...</font>

536
00:48:45,271 --> 00:48:46,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">you need only ask.</font>

537
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:49,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you!</font>

538
00:49:03,495 --> 00:49:06,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell Professor McGonagall. Remus and
I will handle this side of the castle.</font>

539
00:49:08,552 --> 00:49:09,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, sir!</font>

540
00:49:13,666 --> 00:49:19,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey Dean, on second thoughts, tell Professor McGonagall
we might need one or two more wands this side.</font>

541

You and whose army?</font>

552
00:51:17,272 --> 00:51:17,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">You do it.</font>

553
00:51:18,478 --> 00:51:19,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't.</font>

554
00:51:19,254 --> 00:51:19,958

her since we'll probably both be dead by dawn.</font>

00:56:10,906 --> 00:56:11,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know.</font>

We'll never find him on this.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Here he is!</font>

568
00:56:44,402 --> 00:56:45,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Just now...
- Brilliant!</font>

569
00:56:46,094 --> 00:56:47,069

01:03:24,778 --> 01:03:25,464
<font color="#FFFFFF">My Lord?</font>

609
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:28,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">Avada Kedavra!</font>

610
01:03:35,434 --> 01:03:39,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come Nagini, I need to keep you safe.</font>

611
01:03:52,755 --> 01:03:53,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the snake...</font>

612
01:03:54,868 --> 01:03:56,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">and she's the last one.</font>

613
01:03:56,570 --> 01:03:57,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the last Horcrux.</font>

614
01:04:04,781 --> 01:04:05,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look inside him, Harry.</font>

615
01:04:07,544 --> 01:04:10,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Find out where he is,
if you find him, we can find the snake.</font>

616
01:04:11,219 --> 01:04:12,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we can end this!</font>

617
01:04:40,728 --> 01:04:41,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">My Lord...</font>

618
01:04:43,231 --> 01:04:45,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">Might it be less...</font>

619
01:04:47,537 --> 01:04:51,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should not be more prudent to call off
this attack.</font>

620
01:04:52,283 --> 01:04:54,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">Simply seek the boy.</font>

621
01:04:54,376 --> 01:04:55,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yourself.</font>

622
01:04:55,220 --> 01:04:58,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do not need to seek the boy...</font>

623
01:04:58,781 --> 01:05:03,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">before the night is out,
he will come to me! Do you understand?</font>

624
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:05,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at me!</font>

625
01:05:07,243 --> 01:05:10,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">How can you live with yourself,
Lucius?</font>

626
01:05:11,257 --> 01:05:11,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

627
01:05:15,325 --> 01:05:16,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go and find Severus.</font>

628
01:05:18,442 --> 01:05:19,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bring him to me.</font>

629
01:05:28,481 --> 01:05:29,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know where he is.</font>

630
01:05:40,306 --> 01:05:41,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on!</font>

631
01:06:29,551 --> 01:06:30,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

632
01:07:17,914 --> 01:07:21,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have performed extra-ordinary magic
with this wand, My Lord,</font>

633
01:07:21,264 --> 01:07:23,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the last few hours alone.</font>

634
01:07:23,382 --> 01:07:24,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

635
01:07:25,645 --> 01:07:32,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! I am extra-ordinary.
But the wand resists me.</font>

636
01:07:32,834 --> 01:07:38,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is no wand more powerful.
Ollivander himself has said it.</font>

637
01:07:39,023 --> 01:07:44,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tonight, when the boy comes.
It will not fail you, I am sure of it...</font>

638
01:07:46,743 --> 01:07:52,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">It answers to you, and you only.</font>

639
01:07:53,622 --> 01:07:54,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does it?</font>

640
01:07:58,058 --> 01:07:58,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">My Lord?</font>

641
01:08:01,893 --> 01:08:05,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">The wand, does it truly answer to me?</font>

642
01:08:07,997 --> 01:08:09,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a clever man, Severus.</font>

643
01:08:10,204 --> 01:08:11,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Surely you must know...</font>

644
01:08:14,339 --> 01:08:19,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where does its true loyalty lie?
- With you...</font>

645
01:08:20,702 --> 01:08:22,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course, My Lord.</font>

646
01:08:22,941 --> 01:08:29,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Elder Wand cannot serve me properly,
because I am not its true master.</font>

647
01:08:31,672 --> 01:08:35,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Elder Wand belongs to the
wizard who killed its last owner.</font>

648
01:08:43,047 --> 01:08:45,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">You killed Dumbledore, Severus.</font>

649
01:08:47,573 --> 01:08:51,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">While you live, the Elder
Wand cannot truly be mine.</font>

650
01:08:54,362 --> 01:08:57,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've been a good and faithful servant,
Severus.</font>

651
01:08:58,868 --> 01:09:02,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">But only I can live forever.</font>

652
01:09:07,278 --> 01:09:08,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">My Lord...</font>

653
01:09:14,178 --> 01:09:16,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nagini, kill!</font>

654
01:10:17,150 --> 01:10:24,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take it...
Take it up, please!</font>

655
01:10:25,361 --> 01:10:27,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me something!
Quickly, a flask. Anything!</font>

656
01:10:47,110 --> 01:10:48,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take them to the Pensieve.</font>

657
01:10:52,027 --> 01:10:53,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at me...</font>

658
01:10:59,526 --> 01:11:01,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">You really have your mother's eyes.</font>

659
01:11:35,444 --> 01:11:41,770
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>You've fought valiantly,
but in vain...</i></font>

660
01:11:46,258 --> 01:11:53,863
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I do not wish this. Every drop of magical
blood spilled is a terrible waste.</i></font>

661
01:11:54,459 --> 01:11:57,820
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I, therefore command
my forces to retreat...</i></font>

662
01:11:58,974 --> 01:12:03,601
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>In their absence,
dispose your dead with dignity,</i></font>

663
01:12:05,153 --> 01:12:10,750
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Harry Potter,
I now speak directly to you.</i></font>

664
01:12:11,342 --> 01:12:18,826
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>On this night, you have allowed your friends
to die for you, rather than face me yourself.</i></font>

665
01:12:19,341 --> 01:12:25,438
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>There is no greater dishonor.
Join me in the Forbidden Forrest...</i></font>

666
01:12:25,850 --> 01:12:28,099
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>and confront your fate.</i></font>

667
01:12:29,004 --> 01:12:42,301
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>If you do not do this, I shall kill every last man,
woman and child who tries to conceal you from me.</i></font>

668
01:13:02,789 --> 01:13:03,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's everybody?</font>

669
01:13:30,725 --> 01:13:31,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry?</font>

670
01:13:37,534 --> 01:13:41,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, come on!
Don't be sad on it, she's passed.</font>

671
01:13:43,843 --> 01:13:45,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">There, she's gone.</font>

672
01:15:55,464 --> 01:16:00,074
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Freak! Come here! I'm gonna tell mommy!
You're freak!</i></font>

673
01:16:00,552 --> 01:16:02,128
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>You're freak, Lily!</i></font>

674
01:16:02,575 --> 01:16:03,387
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Come here!</i></font>

675
01:16:25,655 --> 01:16:28,860
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>She's jealous.
She's ordinary and you're special.</i></font>

676
01:16:29,230 --> 01:16:30,190
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>That's not true, Severus.</i></font>

677
01:16:54,213 --> 01:16:55,506
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Gryffindor!</i></font>

678
01:17:03,796 --> 01:17:05,648
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- Hi, I'm James.
- Hi, I'm Lily.</i></font>

679
01:17:11,365 --> 01:17:12,352
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Just like your father.</i></font>

680
01:17:15,370 --> 01:17:17,478
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Don't say a word against my father!</i></font>

681
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:30,206
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Masters shall be reunited once more!</i></font>

682
01:17:30,731 --> 01:17:31,601
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Severus.</i></font>

683
01:17:33,775 --> 01:17:34,947
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>No, don't kill me!</i></font>

684
01:17:35,887 --> 01:17:38,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">The prophecy did not
refer to a woman.</font>

685
01:17:39,933 --> 01:17:42,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">It spoke about a boy born
at the end of the July.</font>

686
01:17:42,341 --> 01:17:44,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, but he thinks it's her son!</font>

687
01:17:45,190 --> 01:17:47,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">He intends to hunt them down and
to kill them.</font>

688
01:17:48,524 --> 01:17:52,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hide him... hide them all.
I beg you!</font>

689
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:55,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">What would you give me in exchange,
Severus?</font>

690
01:17:58,117 --> 01:17:59,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Anything.
- Harry...</font>

691
01:18:00,330 --> 01:18:02,042
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Harry, you were so loved.</i></font>

692
01:18:02,733 --> 01:18:06,999
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>So loved!
Harry, mama loves you.</i></font>

693
01:18:07,980 --> 01:18:09,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dadda loves you.</font>

694
01:18:11,715 --> 01:18:12,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry, be safe.</font>

695
01:18:14,097 --> 01:18:14,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be strong.</font>

696
01:18:15,102 --> 01:18:16,521
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Avada Kedavra!</i></font>

697
01:18:22,159 --> 01:18:25,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said you would keep her safe.</font>

698
01:18:25,793 --> 01:18:27,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lily and James...</font>

699
01:18:27,585 --> 01:18:30,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">put their faith in the wrong person,
Severus.</font>

700
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:31,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rather like you.</font>

701
01:18:34,945 --> 01:18:36,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">The boy survives.</font>

702
01:18:36,287 --> 01:18:38,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">He doesn't need protection,
the Dark Lord has gone.</font>

703
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:40,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Dark Lord will return.</font>

704
01:18:41,304 --> 01:18:43,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">And when he does, the boy
will be in terrible danger!</font>

705
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:47,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">He has her eyes.</font>

706
01:18:51,988 --> 01:18:54,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you truly loved her...</font>

707
01:18:57,846 --> 01:19:01,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one, can know.</font>

708
01:19:01,901 --> 01:19:04,254
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I shall never reveal the best of you,
Severus.</i></font>

709
01:19:04,569 --> 01:19:05,314
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Your word?</i></font>

710
01:19:05,706 --> 01:19:08,370
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Can you risk your life every day
to protect the boy?</i></font>

711
01:19:08,495 --> 01:19:14,423
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>He possesses no measurable talent, his arrogance rivals
even that of his father and he seems to relish in his fame...</i></font>

712
01:19:14,653 --> 01:19:16,611
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Don't say a word against my father!</i></font>

713
01:19:17,712 --> 01:19:21,494
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>James Potter, lazy, arrogant.</i></font>

714
01:19:21,619 --> 01:19:24,994
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- My father was a great man!
- Your father was a swine!</i></font>

715
01:19:27,043 --> 01:19:32,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drink it, it will contain the curse to
your hand, for the time being.</font>

716
01:19:32,621 --> 01:19:35,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It will spread, Albus.
- How long?</font>

717
01:19:37,708 --> 01:19:38,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe a year.</font>

718
01:19:42,154 --> 01:19:43,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't ignore me, Severus.</font>

719
01:19:45,097 --> 01:19:48,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">We both know Lord Voldemort has ordered
the Malfoy boy to murder me.</font>

720
01:19:51,296 --> 01:19:57,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">But should he fail, I should presume
the Dark Lord will turn to you.</font>

721
01:20:00,537 --> 01:20:03,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must be the one to kill me,
Severus.</font>

722
01:20:04,714 --> 01:20:06,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is the only way.</font>

723
01:20:07,797 --> 01:20:12,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only then,
will the Dark Lord trust you completely.</font>

724
01:20:18,371 --> 01:20:22,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">It will come a time, when Harry Potter,
must be told something.</font>

725
01:20:24,870 --> 01:20:29,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you must wait, until Voldemort
is at his most vulnerable.</font>

726
01:20:30,613 --> 01:20:32,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Must be told what?</font>

727
01:20:33,616 --> 01:20:37,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">On the night, Lord Voldemort went
to Godric's Hollow to kill Harry...</font>

728
01:20:39,859 --> 01:20:42,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Lily Potter cast
herself between them...</font>

729
01:20:43,194 --> 01:20:45,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">the curse rebounded.</font>

730
01:20:47,149 --> 01:20:50,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">When that happens,
a part of Voldemort's soul...</font>

731
01:20:50,604 --> 01:20:54,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">latched itself onto the only
living thing it could find...</font>

732
01:20:55,811 --> 01:20:57,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry himself.</font>

733
01:20:59,566 --> 01:21:01,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a reason Harry
can speak with snakes...</font>

734
01:21:03,391 --> 01:21:06,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a reason he can look into
Lord Voldemort's mind...</font>

735
01:21:08,547 --> 01:21:14,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">A part of Voldemort lives inside him.</font>

736
01:21:21,079 --> 01:21:23,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, when the time comes...</font>

737
01:21:24,999 --> 01:21:26,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">the boy must die?</font>

738
01:21:29,055 --> 01:21:32,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes... yes.
He must die.</font>

739
01:21:51,584 --> 01:21:55,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've kept him alive, so he can
die at the proper moment?</font>

740
01:22:00,195 --> 01:22:02,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've been raising him
like a pig for slaughter.</font>

741
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:07,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't tell me now, that you've
grown to care for the boy.</font>

742
01:22:12,712 --> 01:22:15,128
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Expecto Patronum</i></font>

743
01:22:27,071 --> 01:22:27,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lily!</font>

744
01:22:31,767 --> 01:22:33,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">After all this time?</font>

745
01:22:37,674 --> 01:22:38,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">Always.</font>

746
01:22:44,954 --> 01:22:46,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, when the time comes...</font>

747
01:22:48,334 --> 01:22:50,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">the boy must die?</font>

748
01:22:51,123 --> 01:22:52,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

749
01:22:53,215 --> 01:22:56,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">He must die.
And Voldemort himself must do it.</font>

750
01:22:58,272 --> 01:22:59,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is essential.</font>

751
01:24:05,660 --> 01:24:07,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where've you been?
- I thought you went to the forest.</font>

752
01:24:08,083 --> 01:24:09,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going there now.</font>

753
01:24:10,067 --> 01:24:11,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you mad?
No...</font>

754
01:24:13,771 --> 01:24:15,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't give yourself up to him.</font>

755
01:24:19,528 --> 01:24:20,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it, Harry?</font>

756
01:24:22,983 --> 01:24:24,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it you know?</font>

757
01:24:27,789 --> 01:24:29,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a reason I can hear them.</font>

758
01:24:30,993 --> 01:24:32,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Horcruxes.</font>

759
01:24:34,728 --> 01:24:36,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I've known for a while.</font>

760
01:24:38,542 --> 01:24:39,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I think you have, too.</font>

761
01:24:43,861 --> 01:24:46,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'll go with you.
- No, kill the snake.</font>

762
01:24:47,636 --> 01:24:49,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kill the snake,
and then it's just him!</font>

763
01:26:10,064 --> 01:26:11,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm ready to die.</font>

764
01:26:53,531 --> 01:26:55,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">Resurrection Stone.</font>

765
01:27:25,663 --> 01:27:28,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've been so brave, sweetheart.</font>

766
01:27:33,133 --> 01:27:36,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you here?
All of you.</font>

767
01:27:39,892 --> 01:27:41,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">We never left.</font>

768
01:27:50,977 --> 01:27:51,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does...</font>

769
01:27:53,380 --> 01:27:54,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does it hurt?</font>

770
01:27:55,663 --> 01:27:56,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dying?</font>

771
01:27:58,266 --> 01:28:00,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quicker than falling asleep.</font>

772
01:28:04,691 --> 01:28:05,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're nearly there, son.</font>

773
01:28:07,365 --> 01:28:08,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

774
01:28:08,801 --> 01:28:11,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never wanted any
of you to die for me.</font>

775
01:28:13,656 --> 01:28:14,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, Remus, your son?</font>

776
01:28:15,399 --> 01:28:18,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Others will tell him what his
mother and father died for.</font>

777
01:28:19,845 --> 01:28:22,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">One day, he'll understand.</font>

778
01:28:35,215 --> 01:28:36,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll stay with me?</font>

779
01:28:38,019 --> 01:28:39,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">Until the end.</font>

780
01:28:41,183 --> 01:28:42,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he won't be able to see you?</font>

781
01:28:43,325 --> 01:28:44,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

782
01:28:46,324 --> 01:28:47,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're here, you see.</font>

783
01:29:03,176 --> 01:29:04,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay close to me.</font>

784
01:29:07,358 --> 01:29:08,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">Always.</font>

785
01:29:23,829 --> 01:29:26,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">No sign of him, My Lord.</font>

786
01:29:43,175 --> 01:29:44,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought he would come.</font>

787
01:30:26,711 --> 01:30:28,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry, no!</font>

788
01:30:28,965 --> 01:30:31,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What're yeh doin' here?
- Quiet!</font>

789
01:30:42,883 --> 01:30:44,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry Potter...</font>

790
01:30:48,190 --> 01:30:49,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Boy Who Lived...</font>

791
01:30:55,199 --> 01:30:56,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">come to die.</font>

792
01:31:15,796 --> 01:31:18,349
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Avada Kedavra</i></font>

793
01:32:13,891 --> 01:32:15,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't help...</font>

794
01:32:16,806 --> 01:32:19,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry, you wonderful boy...</font>

795
01:32:20,972 --> 01:32:23,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">You brave, brave man!</font>

796
01:32:26,909 --> 01:32:28,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let us walk.</font>

797
01:32:36,332 --> 01:32:37,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor, what is that?</font>

798
01:32:41,339 --> 01:32:43,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something beyond either of our help.</font>

799
01:32:47,247 --> 01:32:49,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">A part of Voldemort sent here to die.</font>

800
01:32:50,861 --> 01:32:52,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">And exactly where are we?</font>

801
01:32:53,254 --> 01:32:54,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was going to ask you that.</font>

802
01:32:55,557 --> 01:32:56,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where would you say that we are?</font>

803
01:32:57,610 --> 01:33:00,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it looks like
King's Cross station.</font>

804
01:33:02,367 --> 01:33:03,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only cleaner...</font>

805
01:33:04,769 --> 01:33:06,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">and without all the trains.</font>

806
01:33:07,483 --> 01:33:09,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">King's Cross, is that right?</font>

807
01:33:10,579 --> 01:33:13,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is, as they say, 'your' party.</font>

808
01:33:15,343 --> 01:33:17,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">I expect you now realize that
you and Voldemort...</font>

809
01:33:18,768 --> 01:33:20,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">have been connected by
something other than fate.</font>

810
01:33:21,462 --> 01:33:24,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Since that night in Godric's Hollow,
all those years ago.</font>

811
01:33:24,735 --> 01:33:26,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">So it's true then, sir.</font>

812
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:28,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">A part of him lives within me,
doesn't it?</font>

813
01:33:29,913 --> 01:33:30,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did.</font>

814
01:33:31,050 --> 01:33:35,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's been just destroyed many moments
ago by none other than Voldemort himself.</font>

815
01:33:37,082 --> 01:33:40,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">You, were the Horcrux he
never meant to make, Harry.</font>

816
01:33:54,582 --> 01:33:57,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I have to go back, haven't I?
- Oh, that's up to you.</font>

817
01:33:58,090 --> 01:34:00,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I've a choice?
- Oh, yes!</font>

818
01:34:02,045 --> 01:34:03,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're in King's Cross, you say.</font>

819
01:34:05,989 --> 01:34:10,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think if you so decide,
you'll be able to board a train.</font>

820
01:34:12,158 --> 01:34:14,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">And where would it take me?</font>

821
01:34:15,007 --> 01:34:15,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">On.</font>

822
01:34:34,747 --> 01:34:36,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Voldemort has the Elder Wand.</font>

823
01:34:39,714 --> 01:34:40,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">True.</font>

824
01:34:40,649 --> 01:34:42,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the snake's still alive?</font>

825
01:34:42,348 --> 01:34:42,852
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

826
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:45,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I've nothing to kill it with?</font>

827
01:34:46,984 --> 01:34:49,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help will always be
given at Hogwarts, Harry.</font>

828
01:34:49,507 --> 01:34:50,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">To those who ask for it.</font>

829
01:34:52,792 --> 01:34:56,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've always pride of myself
on my ability to turn a phrase.</font>

830
01:34:57,518 --> 01:34:59,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">Words are,
in my not so humble opinion...</font>

831
01:35:00,812 --> 01:35:03,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">are most inexhaustible
source of magic.</font>

832
01:35:04,747 --> 01:35:08,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">Capable of inflicting
injury and remedies.</font>

833
01:35:09,486 --> 01:35:11,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I would in this case...</font>

834
01:35:11,906 --> 01:35:14,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">amend my original
statement to this:</font>

835
01:35:18,245 --> 01:35:21,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help, will always be
given at Hogwarts,</font>

836
01:35:21,950 --> 01:35:23,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">To those who deserve it.</font>

837
01:35:30,271 --> 01:35:32,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do not pity the dead, Harry...</font>

838
01:35:33,465 --> 01:35:34,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pity the living.</font>

839
01:35:36,069 --> 01:35:37,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">And above all...</font>

840
01:35:37,535 --> 01:35:39,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">all those who live without love.</font>

841
01:35:41,926 --> 01:35:43,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor, my mother's Patronus...</font>

842
01:35:44,580 --> 01:35:46,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">was a doe, wasn't it?</font>

843
01:35:48,385 --> 01:35:50,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">As the same as Professor Snape's.</font>

844
01:35:51,779 --> 01:35:54,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's curious, don't you think?</font>

845
01:35:54,158 --> 01:35:55,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, if I think about it...</font>

846
01:35:56,395 --> 01:35:58,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">it doesn't seem curious at all!</font>

847
01:36:00,820 --> 01:36:02,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll be going now, Harry.</font>

848
01:36:03,415 --> 01:36:04,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor?</font>

849
01:36:09,413 --> 01:36:10,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this all real?</font>

850
01:36:12,194 --> 01:36:13,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or is it just happening
inside my head?</font>

851
01:36:14,108 --> 01:36:16,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course it's happening
inside your head, Harry.</font>

852
01:36:17,923 --> 01:36:20,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why should that mean,
that it's not real?</font>

853
01:36:27,235 --> 01:36:28,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor?</font>

854
01:36:29,038 --> 01:36:30,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">What should I do?</font>

855
01:36:34,646 --> 01:36:35,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor!</font>

856
01:36:39,702 --> 01:36:41,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">My Lord, My Lord...</font>

857
01:36:41,956 --> 01:36:42,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you hurt?</font>

858
01:36:43,457 --> 01:36:45,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't need your help.</font>

859
01:36:56,810 --> 01:36:57,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">The boy...</font>

860
01:36:58,727 --> 01:36:59,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is he dead?</font>

861
01:37:14,838 --> 01:37:15,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is he alive?</font>

862
01:37:17,112 --> 01:37:18,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Draco, is he alive?</font>

863
01:37:46,039 --> 01:37:46,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dead.</font>

864
01:39:14,656 --> 01:39:15,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who is that?</font>

865
01:39:16,048 --> 01:39:17,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hagrid's carrying?</font>

866
01:39:18,080 --> 01:39:19,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">Neville, who is it?</font>

867
01:39:20,604 --> 01:39:22,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry Potter...</font>

to declare yourself.</font>

find a place for you in our rank.</font>

fascinated to hear what you have to say.</font>

01:43:19,348 --> 01:43:20,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to kill the snake.</font>

912
01:43:21,580 --> 01:43:22,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Neville!</font>

913
01:46:16,661 --> 01:46:18,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not my daughter, you bitch!</font>

914
01:46:52,708 --> 01:46:53,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, you were right...</font>

915
01:46:55,863 --> 01:46:57,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">when you told Professor Snape
that wand was failing you.</font>

916
01:46:58,065 --> 01:46:58,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">It will always fail...</font>

917
01:47:01,230 --> 01:47:02,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">I killed Snape!</font>

918
01:47:03,072 --> 01:47:04,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">But what if the wand never belonged
to Snape?</font>

919
01:47:05,245 --> 01:47:06,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if its allegiance is always
to someone else?</font>

920
01:47:08,379 --> 01:47:09,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, come on, Tom...</font>

921
01:47:09,481 --> 01:47:10,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's finish this the way we started.</font>

922
01:47:12,434 --> 01:47:13,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Together!</font>

923
01:48:12,664 --> 01:48:13,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">Die!</font>

924
01:50:59,463 --> 01:51:00,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry!</font>

925
01:52:01,164 --> 01:52:02,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why didn't it work for him?</font>

926
01:52:02,917 --> 01:52:03,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Elder Wand?</font>

927
01:52:05,870 --> 01:52:07,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">It answered to somebody else.</font>

928
01:52:08,724 --> 01:52:11,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">When he killed Snape, he thought
the wand would become his.</font>

929
01:52:11,488 --> 01:52:12,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the thing is...</font>

930
01:52:13,681 --> 01:52:15,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">The wand never belonged to Snape.</font>

931
01:52:16,083 --> 01:52:19,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was Draco, who disarmed Dumbledore
that night in the Astronomy tower.</font>

932
01:52:20,689 --> 01:52:23,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">From that moment on and the wand
answered him,</font>

933
01:52:25,596 --> 01:52:29,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">Until, the other night
when I disarmed Draco.</font>

934
01:52:30,452 --> 01:52:31,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">At Malfoy Manor.</font>

935
01:52:32,345 --> 01:52:33,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, that means...</font>

936
01:52:35,860 --> 01:52:36,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's mine!</font>

937
01:52:39,835 --> 01:52:42,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What should we do with it?
- We?</font>

938
01:52:43,699 --> 01:52:45,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just saying, that's the Elder Wand.</font>

939
01:52:45,822 --> 01:52:47,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">The most powerful wand in the world.</font>

940
01:52:48,476 --> 01:52:50,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">With that, he'd be invincible.</font>

941
01:55:15,019 --> 01:55:15,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Together.</font>

942
01:55:55,462 --> 01:55:56,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Bag?
- Yeah.</font>

943
01:55:57,454 --> 01:55:58,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jumper?</font>

944
01:56:00,178 --> 01:56:00,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna miss you.</font>

945
01:56:02,992 --> 01:56:03,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here they come.</font>

946
01:56:20,005 --> 01:56:20,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dad?</font>

947
01:56:21,637 --> 01:56:23,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if I am put in Slytherin?</font>

948
01:56:26,523 --> 01:56:32,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">Albus Severus Potter. You were named
after two Headmasters of Hogwarts.</font>

949
01:56:34,124 --> 01:56:38,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">One of them was a Slytherin. And he
was the bravest man I've ever known.</font>

950
01:56:41,153 --> 01:56:43,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But just say if I am...
- Then Slytherin house...</font>

951
01:56:44,427 --> 01:56:47,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">will have gained a
wonderful young wizard.</font>

952
01:56:48,642 --> 01:56:49,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">But listen...</font>

953
01:56:50,224 --> 01:56:53,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">If it really means that much to you,
you can choose Gryffindor.</font>

954
01:56:54,249 --> 01:56:56,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Sorting Hat takes
your choice into account.</font>

955
01:56:57,754 --> 01:56:59,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Really?
- Really.</font>

956
01:57:03,972 --> 01:57:05,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ready?
- Ready.</font>
