1
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:06,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello?</font>

2
00:01:08,829 --> 00:01:10,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello?</font>

3
00:01:25,849 --> 00:01:29,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey! Hey! Help me!</font>

4
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:06,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go get him.</font>

5
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:11,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">Day one, Greenie.</font>

6
00:02:11,729 --> 00:02:13,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rise and shine.</font>

7
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">He looks like a slopper to me.</font>

8
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could use some help in the kitchen.</font>

9
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:25,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, we got a runner!</font>

10
00:02:42,259 --> 00:02:43,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take it all in.</font>

11
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's all yours.</font>

12
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

13
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey there, Green Bean.</font>

14
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:44,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not gonna run again. Okay?</font>

15
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:48,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good.</font>

16
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:57,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">My name is Alby.</font>

17
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:01,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you tell me anything
about yourself? Who you are?</font>

18
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where you came from? Anything at all.</font>

19
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

20
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you tell me your name?</font>

21
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:18,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't remember anything.</font>

22
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:23,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why can't I remember anything?
- It's okay.</font>

23
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:25,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, relax.</font>

24
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:26,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">Relax.</font>

25
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:29,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's normal.</font>

26
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:32,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">It happens to us all.</font>

27
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll get your name back
in a day or two.</font>

28
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the one thing they let us keep.</font>

29
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:44,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is this place?</font>

30
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me show you.</font>

31
00:04:59,029 --> 00:05:00,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">We eat here.</font>

32
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:02,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">We sleep here.</font>

33
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:05,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">We grow our own food.
We build our own shelter.</font>

34
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:10,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever we need, the Box provides.
The rest is up to us.</font>

35
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:11,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Box?</font>

36
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:17,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. It's sent up once a month
with fresh supplies and a new Greenie.</font>

37
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">This month that's you.</font>

38
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Congratulations.</font>

39
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:25,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sent up? By who, though?
Who put us here?</font>

40
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">That, we don't know.</font>

41
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, are you all right, Alby?</font>

42
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">Green Bean, meet Newt.</font>

43
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:35,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I'm not around, he's in charge.</font>

44
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a good thing you're
always around then.</font>

45
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was some dash you made earlier.</font>

46
00:05:39,069 --> 00:05:42,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">For a second, I thought
you had the chops to be a runner...</font>

47
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">till you face-planted.</font>

48
00:05:44,069 --> 00:05:45,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was great.</font>

49
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, a "runner"?</font>

50
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:50,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Newt, do me a favor. Go find Chuck.</font>

51
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">- All right.
- Thanks.</font>

52
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I'm sorry to rush this.</font>

53
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">You came up a little late,
and there's a lot to do.</font>

54
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got something special planned tonight.</font>

55
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. You'll see.</font>

56
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:09,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope you're not afraid of heights.</font>

57
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:11,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go. Come on.</font>

58
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is all we got.</font>

59
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've worked hard for it.</font>

60
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:26,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you respect this place...</font>

61
00:06:26,649 --> 00:06:28,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">you and I will get along just fine.</font>

62
00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:30,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's out there?</font>

63
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:42,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">We only have three rules.</font>

64
00:06:43,769 --> 00:06:46,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">First, do your part.</font>

65
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">No time for any freeloaders.</font>

66
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Second, never harm another Glader.</font>

67
00:06:52,939 --> 00:06:55,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">None of this works unless we have trust.</font>

68
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">Most importantly...</font>

69
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:01,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">never go beyond those walls.</font>

70
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you understand me, Greenie?</font>

71
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Alb'!</font>

72
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Chuck. Where you been, man?</font>

73
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's basically the same story
for all of us.</font>

74
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:24,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">We wake up in the Box,
Alby gives us the tour...</font>

75
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:26,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">then here we are.</font>

76
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:30,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry.</font>

77
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:33,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're already doing better than I did.</font>

78
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:37,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">I clunked my pants three times
before they got me out of the pit.</font>

79
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:42,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, come on.</font>

80
00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:51,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dude, where are you going?</font>

81
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just wanna see.</font>

82
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:55,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can look around all you want
but you better not go out there.</font>

83
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why not? What's through there?</font>

84
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:00,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know. I just know what I'm told.</font>

85
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:02,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we're not supposed to leave.</font>

86
00:08:11,649 --> 00:08:14,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Chuck. New Greenie?</font>

87
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">How does it feel to be promoted?</font>

88
00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:17,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Feels great, Ben.</font>

89
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought no one was allowed to leave.</font>

90
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:23,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">I said we're not allowed to leave.</font>

91
00:08:23,329 --> 00:08:26,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're different, they're runners.
They know more about the maze than anyone.</font>

92
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, what?</font>

93
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

94
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? You just said "maze."</font>

95
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:33,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did?</font>

96
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:34,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

97
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:40,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are you going? What are you doing?</font>

98
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just gonna take a look.</font>

99
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:45,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you, you can't.
No one leaves, especially not now.</font>

100
00:08:46,889 --> 00:08:48,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not safe.</font>

101
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, all right, I'm not gonna go.</font>

102
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey!</font>

103
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:05,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">We gotta stop meeting like this, Greenie.</font>

104
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:07,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Get off me!
- All right! Calm, calm, calm.</font>

105
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Don't touch me!
- Take it easy!</font>

106
00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:11,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just relax.</font>

107
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:13,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell is wrong with you guys?</font>

108
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:14,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just calm down, all right?</font>

109
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:16,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, okay?
Why won't you tell me what's out there?</font>

110
00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:18,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We're just trying to protect you.
- It's for your own good.</font>

111
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys can't just keep me here.</font>

112
00:09:19,789 --> 00:09:21,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I can't let you leave.
- Why not?</font>

113
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell?</font>

114
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">Next time, I'm gonna let you leave.</font>

115
00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:17,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome to the Glade.</font>

116
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Light him up!</font>

117
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hell of a first day, Greenie.</font>

118
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:06,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here.</font>

119
00:11:07,529 --> 00:11:09,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put some hair on your chest.</font>

120
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God! What is that?</font>

121
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:25,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't even know.</font>

122
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:28,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Gally's recipe.</font>

123
00:11:29,379 --> 00:11:30,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a trade secret.</font>

124
00:11:32,789 --> 00:11:34,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, he's still an asshole.</font>

125
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:37,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">He saved your life today.</font>

126
00:11:39,929 --> 00:11:42,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Trust me. The maze is a dangerous place.</font>

127
00:11:49,299 --> 00:11:51,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're trapped here, aren't we?</font>

128
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">For the moment.</font>

129
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:58,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">But...</font>

130
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:01,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">you see those guys?</font>

131
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:02,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">There, by the fire?</font>

132
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:05,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those are the runners.</font>

133
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">That guy in the middle there,
that's Minho.</font>

134
00:12:09,659 --> 00:12:11,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's the Keeper of the Runners.</font>

135
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every morning, when those doors open,
they run the maze...</font>

136
00:12:15,299 --> 00:12:18,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">mapping it, memorizing it,
trying to find a way out.</font>

137
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long have they been looking?</font>

138
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three years.</font>

139
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:29,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">And they haven't found anything?</font>

140
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:31,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a lot easier said than done.</font>

141
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen.</font>

142
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:39,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hear that?</font>

143
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the maze, changing.</font>

144
00:12:44,259 --> 00:12:45,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">It changes every night.</font>

145
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">How is that even possible?</font>

146
00:12:50,029 --> 00:12:54,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can ask the people who put us in here,
if you ever meet the bastards.</font>

147
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, the truth is...</font>

148
00:12:59,009 --> 00:13:02,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">the runners are the only ones
who really know what's out there.</font>

149
00:13:02,179 --> 00:13:04,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">They are the strongest
and the fastest of us all.</font>

150
00:13:04,549 --> 00:13:05,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it's a good thing, too...</font>

151
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">because if they don't make it back
before those doors close...</font>

152
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">then they are stuck out there
for the night.</font>

153
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:14,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">And no one has ever survived
a night in the maze.</font>

154
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happens to them?</font>

155
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">We call them Grievers.</font>

156
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:33,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course, no one's ever seen one
and lived to tell about it.</font>

157
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">But they're out there.</font>

158
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right, that's enough questions
for one night. Come on.</font>

159
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:48,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're supposed to be the guest of honor.</font>

160
00:13:49,289 --> 00:13:51,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! No, come on.
Let me show you around.</font>

161
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:53,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

162
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">And there we got the builders.</font>

163
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're very good with their hands...</font>

164
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">but not a lot going on upstairs.</font>

165
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:05,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then we got Winston...</font>

166
00:14:06,009 --> 00:14:07,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">he's the Keeper of the Slicers.</font>

167
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:10,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we got two med-jacks, Clint and Jeff.</font>

168
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:12,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey, what's up?
- Yo, Newt.</font>

169
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">They spend most of their time
bandaging up the slicers.</font>

170
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if I want to be a runner?</font>

171
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:21,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you listened to a word I've just said?
No one wants to be a runner.</font>

172
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, besides, you gotta get chosen.</font>

173
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chosen by who?</font>

174
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you say, Greenie?</font>

175
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:34,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wanna see what you're made of?</font>

176
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Greenie! Greenie! Greenie!</font>

177
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. All right.</font>

178
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:00,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">The rules are simple, Greenie.</font>

179
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:02,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">I try to push you out of the circle...</font>

180
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:04,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">you try to last more than five seconds.</font>

181
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:05,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take it easy on the Greenie.</font>

182
00:15:06,029 --> 00:15:07,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ready?</font>

183
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:14,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get up, boy.</font>

184
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:16,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, Greenie. We're not done yet.</font>

185
00:15:19,549 --> 00:15:21,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop calling me Greenie.</font>

186
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop calling you that?</font>

187
00:15:22,549 --> 00:15:24,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you wanna be called? Shank?</font>

188
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:30,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you think, boys?
Does he look like a Shank?</font>

189
00:15:38,029 --> 00:15:39,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on!</font>

190
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what?
I think I've settled on Shank.</font>

191
00:15:52,909 --> 00:15:54,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">There you go, Greenie!</font>

192
00:15:57,549 --> 00:15:59,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not bad for a Greenie, huh?</font>

193
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thomas.</font>

194
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thomas. Hey!</font>

195
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:14,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thomas!</font>

196
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remember my name. I'm Thomas!</font>

197
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thomas!</font>

198
00:16:27,149 --> 00:16:28,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome home, Thomas.</font>

199
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:42,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good job... Thomas.</font>

200
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell was that?</font>

201
00:16:54,009 --> 00:16:56,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">That, my friend, was a Griever.</font>

202
00:16:58,509 --> 00:17:01,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry, you're safe here with us.</font>

203
00:17:02,179 --> 00:17:04,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing gets through those walls.</font>

204
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:06,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, guys.</font>

205
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:08,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's tuck it in for the night. Come on.</font>

206
00:17:08,289 --> 00:17:09,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was a good night.</font>

207
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good job, man.</font>

208
00:17:42,819 --> 00:17:43,890
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>You're safe here with us.</i></font>

209
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,230
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Wicked is good.</i></font>

210
00:17:45,289 --> 00:17:46,329
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>What's out there?</i></font>

211
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:48,069
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Thomas, Thomas.</i></font>

212
00:17:51,329 --> 00:17:52,710
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Can you hear me?</i></font>

213
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,609
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Everything is going to change.</i></font>

214
00:17:57,809 --> 00:17:58,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thomas.</font>

215
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:05,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Follow me.</font>

216
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:14,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's peaceful, isn't it?</font>

217
00:18:16,019 --> 00:18:19,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know it's hard to believe,
but it wasn't always this way.</font>

218
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">We had dark days.</font>

219
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">We lost a lot of boys to fear.</font>

220
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">To panic.</font>

221
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've come far since then.</font>

222
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Established order...</font>

223
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">made peace.</font>

224
00:18:37,609 --> 00:18:40,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Why are you telling me this?</font>

225
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because you're not like the others.</font>

226
00:18:44,619 --> 00:18:46,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're curious.</font>

227
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:48,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you're one of us now.</font>

228
00:18:49,789 --> 00:18:51,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need to know what that means.</font>

229
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened to them?</font>

230
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like I said...</font>

231
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">dark days, Thomas.</font>

232
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:38,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Has anyone tried climbing to the top?</font>

233
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:42,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tried it. The ivy doesn't go all the way
to the top.</font>

234
00:19:42,509 --> 00:19:45,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">Besides, where are you gonna go from there?</font>

235
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:48,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what about the Box?
Next time it comes up...</font>

236
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:49,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, we tried that.</font>

237
00:19:49,849 --> 00:19:51,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Box won't go back down
with someone in it.</font>

238
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay, what if we...
- No, we tried it, all right?</font>

239
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:55,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Twice.</font>

240
00:19:56,759 --> 00:20:00,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right? Trust me.
Anything you think of, we've already tried.</font>

241
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:04,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">The only way out of here
is through the maze.</font>

242
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, look, you wanna be helpful?</font>

243
00:20:08,869 --> 00:20:11,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here. Go dig us up
some more fertilizer.</font>

244
00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:23,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Just get the fertilizer, Thomas."</font>

245
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:26,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Are you sure, guys?
I can't help in any other way?"</font>

246
00:20:26,349 --> 00:20:28,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">"No, just get the fertilizer."</font>

247
00:20:29,789 --> 00:20:33,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">"You know where it is.
It's just out in the middle of the woods."</font>

248
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're Ben, right?</font>

249
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:21,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know if we ever...</font>

250
00:21:23,339 --> 00:21:24,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you okay?</font>

251
00:21:28,019 --> 00:21:29,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get the hell off me!</font>

252
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's your fault.</font>

253
00:21:31,619 --> 00:21:33,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw you.</font>

254
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">You did this.</font>

255
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:36,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw you!</font>

256
00:21:59,309 --> 00:22:01,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey! Hey!</font>

257
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey!</font>

258
00:22:09,259 --> 00:22:10,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help!</font>

259
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help! Help!</font>

260
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help!</font>

261
00:22:22,099 --> 00:22:23,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll kill you!</font>

262
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:29,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold him down.</font>

263
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

264
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:32,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Calm down, Ben.</font>

265
00:22:32,579 --> 00:22:33,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell happened?</font>

266
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He just attacked me!
- Are you okay?</font>

267
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:38,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Calm down, Ben.</font>

268
00:22:41,619 --> 00:22:43,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No.</font>

269
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lift his shirt.</font>

270
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:46,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lift his shirt.</font>

271
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:47,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! No!</font>

272

00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please. Please.</font>

274
00:22:53,029 --> 00:22:54,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's been stung.</font>

275
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:57,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the middle of the day?</font>

276
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help me, please.</font>

277
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:02,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please. Please, just help.</font>

278
00:23:04,579 --> 00:23:05,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put him in the pit.</font>

00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

- Please don't do it!</font>

282
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:12,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Calm down, Ben.</font>

283
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:13,630

290
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's what happens
when someone gets stung.</font>

291
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen.</font>

292
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:49,529

out of Ben since it happened.</font>

293
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not making any sense.</font>

294
00:23:52,859 --> 00:23:55,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it's only gonna get worse.</font>

295
00:23:55,529 --> 00:23:59,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">The infection is spreading.
He's dangerous.</font>

296
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:04,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did he say to you?</font>

297
00:24:10,339 --> 00:24:13,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said he saw me...</font>

300
00:24:26,289 --> 00:24:27,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get some rest.</font>

301
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:30,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Alby?
- Yeah.</font>

302
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's gonna happen to him?</font>

303
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just listen to me.
Just, please, listen to me!</font>

304

00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no! Please!</font>

311
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:02,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, please! Please, don't!</font>

312
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:05,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can get better!
Please, just listen to me!</font>

313
00:26:06,089 --> 00:26:07,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, stop, please!</font>

314
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:10,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Push him in!
- Stop!</font>

315
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:13,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll get better!</font>

316
00:26:49,569 --> 00:26:51,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">He belongs to the maze now.</font>

317
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:32,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think he might make it?</font>

318
00:27:34,549 --> 00:27:35,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ben?</font>

319
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

320
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one survives a night in the maze.</font>

321
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:49,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">We just gotta forget about him.</font>

322
00:28:19,259 --> 00:28:20,710
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Thomas.</i></font>

323
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,769
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Wicked is good.</i></font>

324
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:26,039
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Don't make it easy on them.</i></font>

325
00:28:26,529 --> 00:28:28,950
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Thomas.</i></font>

326
00:28:29,099 --> 00:28:31,779
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Everything is going to change.</i></font>

327
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:35,150
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Wicked is good.</i></font>

328
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:39,759
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>This is gonna hurt a little.</i></font>

329
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,089
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Wicked is good.</i></font>

330
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:45,819
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Thomas, you have to choose.</i></font>

331
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:16,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">But why would Alby go into the maze?</font>

332
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, he's not a runner.</font>

333
00:29:19,019 --> 00:29:20,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Things are different now.</font>

334
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:23,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alby went to retrace Ben's footsteps
before sundown.</font>

335
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:24,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you gonna help?</font>

336
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:26,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">So he's gonna go back
to where Ben was just stung...</font>

337
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:27,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alby knows what he's doing...</font>

338
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">all right?</font>

339
00:29:29,329 --> 00:29:31,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">He knows better than any of us.</font>

340
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:34,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">What does that mean?</font>

341
00:29:38,069 --> 00:29:40,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like you have heard, yeah?</font>

342
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every month,
the Box sends up a new arrival.</font>

343
00:29:43,579 --> 00:29:45,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">But someone had to be first, right?</font>

344
00:29:46,579 --> 00:29:50,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone had to have spent
a whole month in the Glade, alone.</font>

345
00:29:52,019 --> 00:29:53,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was Alby.</font>

346
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:57,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, it can't have been easy.</font>

347
00:29:57,759 --> 00:30:00,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">But when those other boys started
coming up, one after the other...</font>

348
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:02,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">he saw the truth.</font>

349
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:05,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he learned
that the most important thing...</font>

350
00:30:05,299 --> 00:30:07,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">is that we all have each other.</font>

351
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because we're all in this together.</font>

352
00:30:29,819 --> 00:30:30,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

353
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">There you go, Greenie.</font>

354
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:59,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">They should be back by now.</font>

355
00:31:00,349 --> 00:31:02,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happens if they don't make it?</font>

356
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're gonna make it.</font>

357
00:31:07,029 --> 00:31:08,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happens if they don't?</font>

358
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:11,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're gonna make it.</font>

359
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:46,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, guys,
can't we send someone after them?</font>

360
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's against the rules.</font>

361
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:51,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Either they make it back or they don't.</font>

362
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:54,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't risk losing anyone else.</font>

363
00:32:05,049 --> 00:32:06,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no.</font>

364
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:10,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">There!</font>

365
00:32:13,789 --> 00:32:15,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, somethings wrong.</font>

366
00:32:17,329 --> 00:32:19,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, Minho, you can do it!</font>

367
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:21,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on! Go!</font>

368
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:25,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, you can make it!</font>

369
00:32:25,339 --> 00:32:26,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">Minho, you gotta leave him!</font>

370
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:28,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're not gonna make it.</font>

371
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:30,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">You gotta leave him!</font>

372
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thomas, no!</font>

373
00:33:05,349 --> 00:33:06,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good job.</font>

374
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:10,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just killed yourself.</font>

375
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

376
00:33:26,529 --> 00:33:28,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened to him?</font>

377
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">What does it look like?</font>

378
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:32,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">He got stung.</font>

379
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened to his head?</font>

380
00:33:37,339 --> 00:33:39,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did what I had to do.</font>

381
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:54,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Okay, help me get him up.</font>

382
00:33:54,829 --> 00:33:57,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">We gotta go.
The maze is already changing.</font>

383
00:33:57,259 --> 00:33:58,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Minho!</font>

384
00:34:01,569 --> 00:34:03,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't just leave him here.</font>

385
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:17,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">We gotta get him up.</font>

386
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

387
00:34:36,969 --> 00:34:39,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just sit him down. Sit him down.</font>

388
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:54,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">This isn't going to work. We gotta go.</font>

389
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:55,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">We gotta go!</font>

390
00:34:55,889 --> 00:34:58,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, what are you talking about?
We gotta hide him.</font>

391
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where?
- I don't know.</font>

392
00:34:59,659 --> 00:35:03,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you telling me there's not
a single place we could take him?</font>

393
00:35:04,929 --> 00:35:06,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen to me, shuck-face, all right.</font>

394
00:35:06,829 --> 00:35:10,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take a look around.
There's nowhere to go!</font>

395
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:17,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't get it.</font>

396
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're already dead.</font>

397
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two, three...</font>

398
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two, three...</font>

399
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:54,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

400
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:59,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?
What are you doing?</font>

401
00:36:01,219 --> 00:36:02,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

402
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">We gotta go. We gotta go now!</font>

403
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:11,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, just a little more
and we'll tie it off.</font>

404
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:16,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Minho, stay with me.</font>

405
00:36:16,969 --> 00:36:18,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay with me, Minho.</font>

406
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just a little more, we're almost there.</font>

407
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:21,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm sorry, Greenie.
- What?</font>

408
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Minho!</font>

409
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:04,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

410
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:23,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

411
00:38:52,389 --> 00:38:53,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, shit!</font>

412
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:04,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a crazy son of a bitch.</font>

413
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:07,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, follow me. Come on!</font>

414
00:40:13,969 --> 00:40:17,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, it's changing.
Come on, come on!</font>

415
00:40:18,309 --> 00:40:19,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">This section is closing. Come on.</font>

416
00:40:19,809 --> 00:40:21,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can lose it down here!</font>

417
00:40:28,289 --> 00:40:29,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thomas!</font>

418
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you waiting for?
Get out of there!</font>

419
00:40:37,929 --> 00:40:39,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on!</font>

420
00:40:43,469 --> 00:40:44,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on!</font>

421
00:40:44,769 --> 00:40:46,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, Thomas!
Don't look back!</font>

422
00:40:46,809 --> 00:40:48,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Run!</font>

423
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Move it, Thomas! Go on!</font>

424
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:52,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Move your ass!
Let's go! Come on!</font>

425
00:40:53,079 --> 00:40:54,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, Greenie! Let's go!</font>

426
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:56,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thomas!</font>

427

<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, 98¢ "P!</font>

428
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:24,280

00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're not coming back.</font>

430
00:41:27,349 --> 00:41:28,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go.</font>

431
00:41:38,059 --> 00:41:39,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">No way.</font>

432
00:41:40,989 --> 00:41:42,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah!</font>

433
00:41:42,829 --> 00:41:43,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes!</font>

434
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah!</font>

436
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:53,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Watch out. Easy.</font>

437
00:41:54,469 --> 00:41:57,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What happened out there?
- How did you guys make it out?</font>

438
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:02,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">You saw a Griever?</font>

439
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:05,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I saw one.</font>

440
00:42:06,519 --> 00:42:08,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">He didn't just see it.</font>

441
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:10,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">He killed it.</font>

442
00:42:21,429 --> 00:42:23,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Things are changing.</font>

443
00:42:24,909 --> 00:42:26,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no denying that.</font>

444
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:31,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">First, Ben gets stung in broad daylight.</font>

445
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:33,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then Alby.</font>

446
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:38,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now our Greenie, here,
has taken it upon himself...</font>

447
00:42:38,349 --> 00:42:39,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">to go into the maze.</font>

448
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:44,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which is a clear violation
of our rules here.</font>

449
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:45,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah...</font>

450
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:47,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">but he saved Alby's life.</font>

451
00:42:48,429 --> 00:42:49,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did he?</font>

00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:55,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">For years,
we have coexisted with these things.</font>

453

<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you suggest we do?</font>

456
00:43:06,809 --> 00:43:08,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">He has to be punished.</font>

457
00:43:09,619 --> 00:43:11,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Come on.
- He killed a Griever!</font>

What do you think?</font>

460
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:21,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think...</font>

461
00:43:21,659 --> 00:43:24,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">in all the time we've been here...</font>

462

<font color="#FFFFFF">this dumb shank stayed behind
to help Alby.</font>

465
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:41,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I don't know
if he's brave or stupid.</font>

466
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:47,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">But whatever it is,
we need more of it.</font>

467
00:43:49,090 --> 00:43:50,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">I say we make him a runner.</font>

468
00:43:50,519 --> 00:43:52,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">A runner? What?</font>

469
00:43:53,159 --> 00:43:55,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Minho, let's not jump the gun, here.</font>

470
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:58,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thomas! Thomas! Thomas!</font>

471
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you want to throw the newbie a parade,
that's fine.</font>

472
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:04,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go ahead.</font>

473
00:44:04,139 --> 00:44:06,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if there is one thing
I know about the maze...</font>

474
00:44:06,969 --> 00:44:08,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">it is that you do not...</font>

475
00:44:23,389 --> 00:44:24,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, wait. I know that sound.</font>

476
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The Box. It's coming back up.
- It shouldn't be.</font>

477
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:41,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Newt, what do you see?
- Do you see it?</font>

478
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:43,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a girl.</font>

479
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:47,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">No way.</font>

480
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think she's dead.</font>

481
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:55,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's in her hand?</font>

482
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:11,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">"She's the last one... ever."</font>

483
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:16,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell does that mean?</font>

484
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:21,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thomas...</font>

485
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:39,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you still think I'm overreacting?</font>

486
00:45:53,079 --> 00:45:55,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, what's going on?</font>

487
00:45:55,719 --> 00:45:57,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the matter with her?
Why won't she wake up?</font>

488
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey man,
I got my job the same way you did.</font>

489
00:46:07,159 --> 00:46:08,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you recognize her?</font>

490
00:46:09,659 --> 00:46:10,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

491
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:13,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really? Because she seemed
to recognize you.</font>

492
00:46:15,469 --> 00:46:16,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about the note?</font>

493
00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:19,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll worry about the note later.</font>

494
00:46:20,139 --> 00:46:22,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you should worry about it now.</font>

495
00:46:24,139 --> 00:46:26,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've got enough to deal with
at the moment.</font>

496
00:46:26,449 --> 00:46:28,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's right, Newt.</font>

497
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:32,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">If the Box isn't coming back up,
how long do you think we can last?</font>

498
00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:35,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one said that.</font>

499
00:46:35,590 --> 00:46:37,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's not jump to any conclusions.</font>

500
00:46:39,289 --> 00:46:42,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll just wait until she wakes up
and see what she knows.</font>

501
00:46:43,329 --> 00:46:46,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somebody has gotta have
some answers around here.</font>

502
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:48,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

503
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:52,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where are you going?
- Back into the maze.</font>

504
00:46:57,679 --> 00:46:58,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

505
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Thomas.</font>

506
00:47:02,179 --> 00:47:05,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is this with you? A death wish?</font>

507
00:47:05,449 --> 00:47:07,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just got out
and now you want back in?</font>

508
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:12,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Newt said that no one has ever seen a
Griever and lived to tell about it, right?</font>

509
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Minho, now we have one.</font>

510
00:47:15,559 --> 00:47:18,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're telling me
you're not even a little bit curious?</font>

511
00:47:18,699 --> 00:47:20,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not really, no.</font>

512
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:26,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, what's the plan?</font>

513
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:28,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're gonna go out
and dissect that thing all by yourself?</font>

514
00:47:28,809 --> 00:47:30,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will if I have to.</font>

515
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:33,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have the other runners left yet?</font>

516
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:35,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">The other runners quit this morning.</font>

517
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:41,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">After Alby got stung, they're not
in any hurry to get back out there.</font>

518
00:47:43,059 --> 00:47:44,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you?</font>

519
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:49,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think it's time we find out
what we're really up against.</font>

520
00:47:53,369 --> 00:47:54,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

521
00:47:54,869 --> 00:47:57,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you're not going back out there alone.</font>

522
00:47:57,239 --> 00:47:59,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Meet me in the woods in half-an-hour.</font>

523
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:24,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will this be enough?</font>

524
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:28,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

525
00:48:30,139 --> 00:48:31,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go.</font>

526
00:48:48,219 --> 00:48:49,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on!</font>

527
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:13,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's disgusting.</font>

528
00:49:14,610 --> 00:49:16,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's something in there.</font>

529
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:19,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">You mean, besides a Griever pancake?</font>

530
00:49:27,659 --> 00:49:29,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa, what are you doing?</font>

531
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:46,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you said it was dead.</font>

532
00:49:47,309 --> 00:49:49,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Was it a reflex?
- You hope.</font>

533
00:49:51,949 --> 00:49:54,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, come on.
Let's try and pull it out.</font>

534
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:56,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone get a hand on it.
Come on.</font>

535
00:49:56,619 --> 00:49:58,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, ready? On three.</font>

536
00:49:58,489 --> 00:50:00,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">One, two, three!</font>

537
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are you okay, Fry?
- Yeah. Thanks, brother.</font>

538
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:48,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell is that?</font>

539
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:58,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Interesting.</font>

540
00:50:58,650 --> 00:51:00,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, whatever it is...</font>

541
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:02,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">can we take this up back at the Glade?</font>

542
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:04,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I don't want to meet
this guy's friends.</font>

543
00:51:05,059 --> 00:51:06,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's right.</font>

544
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:09,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's getting late. Come on.</font>

545
00:51:20,809 --> 00:51:22,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">We found this.</font>

546
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:24,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was inside a Griever.</font>

547
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:26,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">These are the same letters
we get in our supplies.</font>

548
00:51:26,679 --> 00:51:27,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

549
00:51:27,809 --> 00:51:31,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoever put us here
obviously made the Grievers.</font>

550
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:34,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the first real clue, the first
anything, you've found in over years.</font>

551
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:37,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Right, Minho?
- Right.</font>

552
00:51:37,489 --> 00:51:40,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Newt, we gotta go back out there.</font>

553
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:43,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who knows where this might lead us.</font>

554
00:51:45,530 --> 00:51:47,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see what he's trying to do, right?</font>

555
00:51:48,329 --> 00:51:49,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">First he breaks our rules...</font>

556
00:51:49,769 --> 00:51:52,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then he tries to convince us
to abandon them totally.</font>

557
00:51:52,909 --> 00:51:55,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">The rules are the only thing
that have ever held us together.</font>

558
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why now are we questioning that?</font>

559
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:00,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">If Alby was here,
you know he'd agree with me.</font>

560
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:03,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">This shank needs to be punished.</font>

561
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:13,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're right.</font>

562
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:14,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thomas broke the rules.</font>

563
00:52:15,429 --> 00:52:16,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">One night in the pit,
and no food.</font>

564
00:52:16,929 --> 00:52:19,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, Newt! One night in the pit?</font>

565
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:22,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think that's gonna stop him
from going into the maze?</font>

566
00:52:22,269 --> 00:52:23,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

567
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:28,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we can't just have non-runners running
into the maze whenever they feel like it.</font>

568
00:52:29,139 --> 00:52:30,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">So let's just make this official.</font>

569
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:33,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Starting from tomorrow,
you're a runner.</font>

570
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:39,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow.</font>

571
00:52:39,789 --> 00:52:41,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Gally...
- No, Fry.</font>

572
00:52:49,329 --> 00:52:50,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks, Newt.</font>

573
00:53:08,309 --> 00:53:09,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, where are we going?</font>

574
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll see.</font>

575
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:40,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the maze.</font>

576
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:43,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">All of it.</font>

577
00:53:45,550 --> 00:53:49,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you mean "all of it"?
I thought you were still mapping it.</font>

578
00:53:50,019 --> 00:53:51,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's nothing left to map.</font>

579
00:53:54,059 --> 00:53:56,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've run every inch of it myself.</font>

580
00:53:56,230 --> 00:53:57,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every cycle.</font>

581
00:53:57,860 --> 00:53:59,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every pattern.</font>

582
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:04,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">If there was a way out,
we would have found it by now.</font>

583
00:54:06,369 --> 00:54:08,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why haven't you told anyone this?</font>

584
00:54:10,679 --> 00:54:12,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was Alby's call.</font>

585
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:16,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">People needed to believe
we had a chance of getting out.</font>

586
00:54:17,650 --> 00:54:19,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">But maybe now...</font>

587
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:21,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">we have a real chance.</font>

588
00:54:27,159 --> 00:54:28,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take a look at this.</font>

589
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:32,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">About a year ago, we started exploring
these outer sections.</font>

590
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:35,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">We found these numbers
printed on the walls.</font>

591
00:54:35,699 --> 00:54:38,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sections 1 through 8.</font>

592
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:42,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, the way it works,
is every night, when the maze changes...</font>

593
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:44,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">it opens up a new section.</font>

594
00:54:44,409 --> 00:54:46,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">So today, Section 6 was open.</font>

595
00:54:47,010 --> 00:54:50,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tomorrow, it will be 4,
then 8, then 3.</font>

596
00:54:50,849 --> 00:54:53,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">The pattern always stays the same.</font>

597
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:58,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's so special about 7?</font>

598
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:00,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

599
00:55:01,059 --> 00:55:03,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">But last night,
when you killed that Griever...</font>

600
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Section 7 was open.</font>

601
00:55:05,769 --> 00:55:08,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think it must be where it comes from.</font>

602
00:55:08,429 --> 00:55:11,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tomorrow, you and I
are gonna take a closer look.</font>

603
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:13,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey!</font>

604
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:15,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you guys doing?
You're not allowed in here.</font>

605
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:18,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sorry, it's just the...
- it's the girl.</font>

606
00:55:18,710 --> 00:55:19,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is she awake?</font>

607
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:21,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">You could say that.</font>

608
00:55:22,349 --> 00:55:24,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chuck, what's going on?</font>

609
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:26,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Girls are awesome.</font>

610
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:28,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leave me alone!</font>

611
00:55:28,519 --> 00:55:29,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Watch your head!</font>

612
00:55:30,519 --> 00:55:32,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, throw one more of those things...</font>

613
00:55:33,159 --> 00:55:34,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Go away!
- We come in peace!</font>

614
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:35,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What happened?
- Just duck!</font>

615
00:55:36,030 --> 00:55:37,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think she likes us very much.</font>

616
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:39,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What do you want from me?
- We just wanna talk.</font>

617
00:55:39,530 --> 00:55:40,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm warning you!</font>

618
00:55:40,869 --> 00:55:42,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take cover, y'all! Take cover!</font>

619
00:55:43,699 --> 00:55:45,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, it's Thomas! It's Thomas!</font>

620
00:55:52,579 --> 00:55:54,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna come up, okay?</font>

621
00:55:58,420 --> 00:55:59,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

622
00:56:00,550 --> 00:56:02,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just me.</font>

623
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:07,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm coming up.</font>

624
00:56:15,429 --> 00:56:16,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, just...</font>

625
00:56:16,739 --> 00:56:18,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Easy, all right?</font>

626
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:20,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where am I?</font>

627
00:56:20,539 --> 00:56:22,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is this place?</font>

628
00:56:22,539 --> 00:56:24,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why can't I remember anything?</font>

629
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:27,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is all normal. Okay?
We've all been through this.</font>

630
00:56:27,110 --> 00:56:28,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay?</font>

631
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your name will come back to you
in a couple of days.</font>

632
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:33,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's the one thing that...
- Teresa.</font>

633
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:35,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did you say?</font>

634
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">My name.</font>

635
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Teresa.</font>

636
00:56:41,429 --> 00:56:43,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Teresa, I'm Thomas.</font>

637
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you already knew that,
though, I guess, huh?</font>

638
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:53,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">They said I kept saying
your name in my sleep.</font>

639
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:54,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are you?</font>

640
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:00,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

641
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:05,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't remember.</font>

642
00:57:05,179 --> 00:57:08,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">None of us here can remember anything.</font>

643
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:11,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">We all woke up here
just like you did.</font>

644
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:14,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, I promise...</font>

645
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna take this.</font>

646
00:57:22,269 --> 00:57:23,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

647
00:57:24,869 --> 00:57:26,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's going on up there?</font>

648
00:57:30,139 --> 00:57:31,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is she coming down?</font>

649
00:57:40,650 --> 00:57:43,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, you guys just give
us a second, okay?</font>

650
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:46,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

651
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:48,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

652
00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:50,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this what all girls are like?</font>

653
00:57:53,230 --> 00:57:54,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">That girl is crazy.</font>

654
00:57:59,409 --> 00:58:02,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">"She's the last one."
What does that mean?</font>

655
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not sure.</font>

656
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:09,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ever since you came up,
that Box hasn't gone back down.</font>

657
00:58:10,579 --> 00:58:13,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just think it's got everyone
a little worried.</font>

658
00:58:15,349 --> 00:58:17,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">Especially Gally.</font>

659
00:58:20,590 --> 00:58:22,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">He thinks it's my fault.</font>

660
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:29,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you sure you don't
remember anything else?</font>

661
00:58:31,539 --> 00:58:33,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remember water...</font>

662
00:58:34,070 --> 00:58:35,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">feeling like I was drowning.</font>

663
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:39,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">These faces staring at me.</font>

664
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:46,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">And this woman's voice
saying the same thing over and over.</font>

665
00:58:46,550 --> 00:58:47,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Wicked is good."</font>

666
00:58:52,019 --> 00:58:54,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ever since I've been here,
I've had these dreams.</font>

667
00:58:54,929 --> 00:58:57,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought they were dreams.</font>

668
00:59:00,099 --> 00:59:01,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">You...</font>

669
00:59:02,369 --> 00:59:04,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were there.</font>

670
00:59:06,909 --> 00:59:07,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were there...</font>

671
00:59:08,010 --> 00:59:10,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you told me that
everything was gonna change.</font>

672
00:59:14,179 --> 00:59:15,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">What does it mean?</font>

673
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:21,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.
I just always get pieces.</font>

674
00:59:22,119 --> 00:59:24,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the others don't remember anything?</font>

675
00:59:24,590 --> 00:59:25,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

676
00:59:28,659 --> 00:59:30,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are we different?</font>

677
00:59:38,039 --> 00:59:40,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">These were in my pocket when I came up.</font>

678
00:59:47,179 --> 00:59:49,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">"W.C.K.D."</font>

679
00:59:52,519 --> 00:59:54,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Wicked is good."</font>

680
00:59:56,420 --> 00:59:58,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if we were sent here for a reason?</font>

681
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alby.</font>

682
01:00:05,199 --> 01:00:07,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't even know what this stuff is.</font>

683
01:00:07,329 --> 01:00:08,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't know who sent it.</font>

684
01:00:08,969 --> 01:00:10,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or why it came up here with you.</font>

685
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:13,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">For all we know,
this thing could kill him.</font>

686
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:15,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's already dying.</font>

687
01:00:16,309 --> 01:00:17,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at him.</font>

688
01:00:18,510 --> 01:00:21,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">How could this possibly make it any worse?</font>

689
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:24,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, it's worth a try.</font>

690
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:29,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

691
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:31,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do it.</font>

692
01:00:41,030 --> 01:00:42,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

693
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:46,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">You shouldn't be here!
You shouldn't be here!</font>

694
01:00:46,369 --> 01:00:47,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

695
01:00:47,969 --> 01:00:49,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Watch out!</font>

696
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:53,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get the syringe! Let go!</font>

697
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:05,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that worked.</font>

698
01:01:05,659 --> 01:01:07,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, from now on...</font>

699
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:10,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">someone stays here and
watches him around the clock.</font>

700
01:01:14,730 --> 01:01:16,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

701
01:01:18,969 --> 01:01:21,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sundown, Greenie. Time to go.</font>

702
01:01:37,690 --> 01:01:39,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, what is your problem with me?</font>

703
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:43,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything started going wrong
the minute you showed up.</font>

704
01:01:44,099 --> 01:01:46,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">First Ben, then Alby...</font>

705
01:01:47,030 --> 01:01:48,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">and now the girl.</font>

706
01:01:50,070 --> 01:01:52,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody saw she recognized you.</font>

707
01:01:54,010 --> 01:01:56,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'm betting you know who she is.</font>

708
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:13,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gally...</font>

709
01:02:15,659 --> 01:02:18,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">you know we can't stay here forever, right?</font>

710
01:02:39,250 --> 01:02:40,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's there?</font>

711
01:02:41,519 --> 01:02:42,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just me.</font>

712
01:02:43,389 --> 01:02:44,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, Chuck.</font>

713
01:02:44,789 --> 01:02:46,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here.</font>

714
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:48,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll run better on a full stomach.</font>

715
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:02,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks, Chuck.</font>

716
01:03:07,610 --> 01:03:09,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, what do you got there?</font>

717
01:03:15,389 --> 01:03:17,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow, that came out pretty damn good.</font>

718
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:19,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's that for?</font>

719
01:03:21,059 --> 01:03:22,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's for my parents.</font>

720
01:03:23,630 --> 01:03:25,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">You remember your parents?</font>

721
01:03:26,599 --> 01:03:27,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

722
01:03:28,969 --> 01:03:30,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I know I must have them.</font>

723
01:03:32,969 --> 01:03:35,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">And wherever they are,
I'm sure they miss me...</font>

724
01:03:35,610 --> 01:03:38,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I can't miss them
because I don't remember them.</font>

725
01:03:44,150 --> 01:03:47,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you think
you're gonna find out there tomorrow?</font>

726
01:03:49,789 --> 01:03:51,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

727
01:03:53,690 --> 01:03:57,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if there's a way out, Chuck,
me and Minho are gonna find it.</font>

728
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:04,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here.</font>

729
01:04:10,510 --> 01:04:12,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chuck, why would you give this to me?</font>

730
01:04:15,010 --> 01:04:16,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't remember them anyway.</font>

731
01:04:18,750 --> 01:04:22,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">But maybe if you find a way out,
you can give it to them for me.</font>

732
01:04:24,719 --> 01:04:26,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll let you get some sleep.</font>

733
01:04:36,070 --> 01:04:37,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Chuck.</font>

734
01:04:38,099 --> 01:04:39,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come here.</font>

735
01:04:43,610 --> 01:04:45,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put out your hand.</font>

736
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:49,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to give that to them yourself.</font>

737
01:04:51,550 --> 01:04:53,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna get out of here.</font>

738
01:04:53,250 --> 01:04:54,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">All of us.</font>

739
01:04:55,719 --> 01:04:56,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay?</font>

740
01:04:57,460 --> 01:04:58,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">I promise.</font>

741
01:05:01,329 --> 01:05:02,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah.
- All right.</font>

742
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Good night.
- Good night, buddy.</font>

743
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:25,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Big day, Greenie. Are you sure
you don't wanna sit this one out?</font>

744
01:05:25,849 --> 01:05:27,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, man. Get me out of here.</font>

745
01:05:27,650 --> 01:05:28,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

746
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:48,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go!</font>

747
01:05:59,889 --> 01:06:01,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">This way. Not much
further to the inner ring.</font>

748
01:06:02,019 --> 01:06:03,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go!</font>

749
01:06:06,590 --> 01:06:08,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on! This way.</font>

750
01:06:33,989 --> 01:06:35,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's strange.</font>

751
01:06:35,750 --> 01:06:36,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

752
01:06:36,989 --> 01:06:39,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seven is not supposed to be open
for another week.</font>

753
01:06:46,599 --> 01:06:49,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell is this place?</font>

754
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:51,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">We call them blades.</font>

755
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:12,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Ben's, isn't it?</font>

756
01:07:12,289 --> 01:07:13,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

757
01:07:14,829 --> 01:07:17,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">A Griever must have pulled him down here.</font>

758
01:07:24,099 --> 01:07:25,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa, hey!</font>

759
01:07:47,489 --> 01:07:49,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think it's showing us the way.</font>

760
01:07:56,170 --> 01:07:57,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, wait, wait.</font>

761
01:07:57,269 --> 01:07:58,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, what?</font>

762
01:08:00,769 --> 01:08:02,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">This way. Come on.</font>

763
01:08:26,229 --> 01:08:29,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Minho, you ever see this place before?</font>

764
01:08:30,470 --> 01:08:31,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

765
01:08:53,390 --> 01:08:55,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just another dead end.</font>

766
01:09:22,850 --> 01:09:24,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you sure about this?</font>

767
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:29,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nope.</font>

768
01:10:03,229 --> 01:10:04,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grievers.</font>

769
01:10:16,779 --> 01:10:18,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell was that?</font>

770
01:10:24,119 --> 01:10:25,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">We gotta get out of here.</font>

771
01:10:25,949 --> 01:10:28,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me the key, give me the key!</font>

772
01:10:33,489 --> 01:10:34,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Move, move!</font>

773
01:10:41,399 --> 01:10:43,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">We gotta go! Run, Thomas!</font>

774
01:10:43,270 --> 01:10:44,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna get trapped!</font>

775
01:10:45,069 --> 01:10:46,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go! Go!</font>

776
01:10:50,739 --> 01:10:51,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go, go, go!</font>

777
01:10:52,079 --> 01:10:53,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Move!</font>

778
01:11:03,119 --> 01:11:04,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Minho!</font>

779
01:11:04,289 --> 01:11:06,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on! Let's go, let's go!</font>

780
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:11,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, move!</font>

781
01:11:11,930 --> 01:11:13,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep going!
Keep going! Let's go!</font>

782
01:11:15,930 --> 01:11:17,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go, go, go!</font>

783
01:11:32,649 --> 01:11:33,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go, go, go!</font>

784
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:43,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on! Don't look back!</font>

785
01:11:48,199 --> 01:11:49,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on!</font>

786
01:11:52,069 --> 01:11:53,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, shit!</font>

787
01:11:55,210 --> 01:11:56,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">There!</font>

788
01:12:17,060 --> 01:12:18,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell's going on out there?</font>

789
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell you done now, Thomas?</font>

790
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">We found something, a new passage.
We think it could be a way out.</font>

791
01:12:22,930 --> 01:12:24,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Really?
- It's true.</font>

792
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:27,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">We opened a door,
something I'd never seen before.</font>

793
01:12:27,439 --> 01:12:29,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think it must be where the
Grievers go during the day.</font>

794
01:12:29,239 --> 01:12:30,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait!</font>

795
01:12:30,579 --> 01:12:32,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're saying you found
the Grievers' home?</font>

796
01:12:32,909 --> 01:12:34,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you want us to go in?</font>

797
01:12:34,210 --> 01:12:35,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Their way in could be our way out, Chuck.</font>

798
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:38,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, or there could be a dozen Grievers
on the other side.</font>

799
01:12:38,420 --> 01:12:41,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">The truth is, Thomas doesn't know
what he has done, as usual.</font>

800
01:12:41,789 --> 01:12:44,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, at least I did something, Gally.
I mean, what have you done?</font>

801
01:12:44,890 --> 01:12:46,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aside from hide behind these walls
all the time?</font>

802
01:12:47,060 --> 01:12:48,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me tell you something, Greenie.</font>

803
01:12:48,529 --> 01:12:51,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've been here days, all right?
I've been here years!</font>

804
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:53,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, you've been here years
and you're still here, Gally!</font>

805
01:12:53,630 --> 01:12:54,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">What does that tell you?</font>

806
01:12:54,869 --> 01:12:56,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe you should start doing things
a little differently.</font>

807
01:12:56,470 --> 01:12:58,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe you should be in charge,
what about that?</font>

808
01:12:58,739 --> 01:13:00,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, it's Alby!</font>

809
01:13:01,109 --> 01:13:03,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's awake.</font>

810
01:13:04,239 --> 01:13:05,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Has he said anything?</font>

811
01:13:05,579 --> 01:13:06,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

812
01:13:08,380 --> 01:13:09,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Alb?"</font>

813
01:13:13,390 --> 01:13:15,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alby, are you all right?</font>

814
01:13:21,390 --> 01:13:23,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Alby.</font>

815
01:13:26,199 --> 01:13:29,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alby, we might have just
found a way out of the maze.</font>

816
01:13:29,930 --> 01:13:32,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you hear me?
We could be getting out of here.</font>

817
01:13:34,909 --> 01:13:36,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't.</font>

818
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:40,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't leave.</font>

819
01:13:41,449 --> 01:13:43,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">They won't let us.</font>

820
01:13:43,619 --> 01:13:45,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you talking about?</font>

821
01:13:46,050 --> 01:13:47,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remember.</font>

822
01:13:51,289 --> 01:13:53,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you remember?</font>

823
01:13:55,090 --> 01:13:56,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">You.</font>

824
01:14:00,930 --> 01:14:03,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were always their favorite, Thomas.</font>

825
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:05,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Always.</font>

826
01:14:09,210 --> 01:14:10,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why did you do this?</font>

827
01:14:11,739 --> 01:14:14,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why did you come here?</font>

828
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:25,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Winston, what's going on?</font>

829
01:14:25,819 --> 01:14:28,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the doors. They aren't closing.</font>

830
01:15:20,909 --> 01:15:24,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chuck, go to the Council Hall
and start barricading the doors.</font>

831
01:15:25,149 --> 01:15:26,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Winston, you go with him.</font>

832
01:15:26,250 --> 01:15:27,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got it.</font>

833
01:15:27,090 --> 01:15:27,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get the others.</font>

834
01:15:28,020 --> 01:15:29,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell them to go to the forest.
Go hide, now!</font>

835
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:31,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Minho, I want you to grab
every weapon you can find.</font>

836
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:33,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll meet you at Council Hall.</font>

837
01:15:33,119 --> 01:15:34,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go.</font>

838
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:39,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Teresa, you and I are gonna go
get Alby, all right? Come on.</font>

839
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:48,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, everybody hide!</font>

840
01:15:48,810 --> 01:15:49,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">Teresa!</font>

841
01:15:49,869 --> 01:15:52,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on! Run! Run!</font>

842
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:02,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay down!</font>

843
01:16:02,550 --> 01:16:03,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Run!</font>

844
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:19,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Zart!</font>

845
01:16:23,210 --> 01:16:24,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">(me!</font>

846
01:16:24,279 --> 01:16:26,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go! Get to the village!</font>

847
01:16:33,020 --> 01:16:34,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go, go, go!</font>

848
01:16:41,090 --> 01:16:42,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay down, stay down!</font>

849
01:16:43,159 --> 01:16:45,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gally! Let me in, let me in!</font>

850
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:53,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alby!</font>

851
01:16:53,340 --> 01:16:54,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you okay?</font>

852
01:16:54,409 --> 01:16:55,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's going on?</font>

853
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:56,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're here.</font>

854
01:16:56,909 --> 01:16:58,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grievers?</font>

855
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:06,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thomas, what do we do?</font>

856
01:17:06,119 --> 01:17:07,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's got me!</font>

857
01:17:13,289 --> 01:17:14,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody, run, run, run!</font>

858
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:16,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff, come on, go, go, go!</font>

859
01:17:31,579 --> 01:17:33,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone, go, go, go!</font>

860
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:53,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep moving! Oh, shit!</font>

861
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:55,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alby!</font>

862
01:17:56,300 --> 01:17:57,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get behind me!</font>

863
01:18:00,739 --> 01:18:02,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on!</font>

864
01:18:05,409 --> 01:18:06,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Over here, let's go!</font>

865
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:09,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">Over here! Let's go! Come on!</font>

866
01:18:11,750 --> 01:18:13,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">Over here, come on!</font>

867
01:18:13,119 --> 01:18:14,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Winston!</font>

868
01:18:14,649 --> 01:18:16,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get Alby inside.</font>

869
01:18:16,789 --> 01:18:18,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chuck, get in! Go, go, go!</font>

870
01:18:20,359 --> 01:18:22,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lock down the doors!</font>

871
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:39,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Careful.</font>

872
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:44,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay back, guys.</font>

873
01:19:10,310 --> 01:19:11,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is everyone all right?</font>

874
01:19:12,479 --> 01:19:14,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help!</font>

875
01:19:14,380 --> 01:19:16,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">. Hey, grab him' - Help! '</font>

876
01:19:19,149 --> 01:19:20,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Watch out!</font>

877
01:19:27,020 --> 01:19:28,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chuck!</font>

878
01:19:30,729 --> 01:19:32,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Chuck, no!
- Grab him!</font>

879
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:33,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pull him back!</font>

880
01:19:34,970 --> 01:19:36,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Help!
- Chuck, don't let go!</font>

881
01:19:36,729 --> 01:19:38,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">No shit!</font>

882
01:19:38,569 --> 01:19:40,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Pull!
- Don't let him go!</font>

883
01:20:01,590 --> 01:20:03,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Chuck, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.</font>

884
01:20:05,699 --> 01:20:06,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks, Alby.</font>

885
01:20:08,270 --> 01:20:09,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alby! Watch out!</font>

886
01:20:11,899 --> 01:20:12,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grab him!</font>

887
01:20:16,609 --> 01:20:18,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thomas, get them out.</font>

888
01:20:20,979 --> 01:20:22,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alby!</font>

889
01:20:22,079 --> 01:20:23,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

890
01:20:23,750 --> 01:20:24,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thomas...</font>

891
01:20:24,850 --> 01:20:26,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thomas!
- Don't go out there!</font>

892
01:20:26,579 --> 01:20:27,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Thomas, wait!</font>

893
01:20:27,989 --> 01:20:29,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thomas, wait!</font>

894
01:20:37,699 --> 01:20:39,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is everybody?</font>

895
01:20:39,430 --> 01:20:41,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's that over there?</font>

896
01:20:48,140 --> 01:20:49,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gally...</font>

897
01:20:51,039 --> 01:20:52,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is all you, Thomas!</font>

898
01:20:52,810 --> 01:20:53,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look around!</font>

899
01:20:53,779 --> 01:20:55,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Back off, Gally!
It's not Thomas' fault!</font>

900
01:20:55,550 --> 01:20:56,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">You heard what Alby said!</font>

901
01:20:56,649 --> 01:20:57,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He's one of them!
- One of who?</font>

902
01:20:57,979 --> 01:21:02,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's one of them, and they sent him here
to destroy everything, and now he has!</font>

903
01:21:02,250 --> 01:21:04,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look around, Thomas! Look around!</font>

904
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:06,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is your fault!</font>

905
01:21:06,090 --> 01:21:07,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Back off, Gally!
This is not Thomas' fault!</font>

906
01:21:07,890 --> 01:21:10,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you talking about?
Calm down.</font>

907
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:14,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">They sent him here, and now he's destroyed
everything that we've built!</font>

908
01:21:14,930 --> 01:21:16,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you talking about?</font>

909
01:21:18,439 --> 01:21:20,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe he's right.</font>

910
01:21:20,239 --> 01:21:22,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thomas...</font>

911
01:21:23,140 --> 01:21:25,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to remember, Teresa.</font>

912
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:27,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thomas...</font>

913
01:21:27,479 --> 01:21:28,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thomas!</font>

914
01:21:28,579 --> 01:21:29,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, don't!</font>

915
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:32,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thomas!</font>

916
01:21:32,479 --> 01:21:34,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chuck, get the other syringe!</font>

917
01:21:34,819 --> 01:21:36,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay.</font>

918
01:21:36,619 --> 01:21:38,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thomas, I'm here.</font>

919
01:21:49,670 --> 01:21:51,039
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Who put us here?</i></font>

920
01:21:52,300 --> 01:21:53,779
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>That we don't know.</i></font>

921
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:00,020
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Teresa...</i></font>

922
01:22:00,180 --> 01:22:01,880
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>why are we doing this?</i></font>

923
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:07,060
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Excellent, Thomas.</i></font>

924
01:22:07,119 --> 01:22:08,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come with me.</font>

925
01:22:09,689 --> 01:22:10,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wicked isn't good.</font>

926
01:22:10,789 --> 01:22:11,819
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Thomas...</i></font>

927
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:13,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wicked is good.</font>

928
01:22:14,689 --> 01:22:15,770
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>How could this be my fault?</i></font>

929
01:22:15,789 --> 01:22:17,000
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>You did this!</i></font>

930
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:18,800
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I saw you!</i></font>

931
01:22:20,630 --> 01:22:22,979
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I can't keep watching them die.</i></font>

932
01:22:29,010 --> 01:22:30,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

933
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:33,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you okay?</font>

934
01:22:35,909 --> 01:22:37,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell were you thinking?</font>

935
01:22:43,319 --> 01:22:44,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened?</font>

936
01:22:45,220 --> 01:22:46,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gally has taken control.</font>

937
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:50,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said we had a choice.
Either join him...</font>

938
01:22:50,899 --> 01:22:53,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">or get banished at sundown with you.</font>

939
01:22:55,170 --> 01:22:57,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the others agreed to that?</font>

940
01:22:58,239 --> 01:23:02,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gally has everyone convinced that
you're the reason all this has happened.</font>

941
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:07,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, he's been right so far.</font>

942
01:23:08,779 --> 01:23:10,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you talking about?</font>

943
01:23:11,279 --> 01:23:13,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">This place...</font>

944
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:16,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's not what we thought it was.</font>

945
01:23:17,789 --> 01:23:20,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not a prison, it's a test.</font>

946
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:23,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">It all started when we were kids.</font>

947
01:23:24,130 --> 01:23:26,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">They would give us these challenges.</font>

948
01:23:27,529 --> 01:23:30,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">They were experimenting on us.</font>

949
01:23:31,199 --> 01:23:34,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then people started disappearing.</font>

950
01:23:34,439 --> 01:23:37,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every month,
one after the other, like clockwork.</font>

951
01:23:37,579 --> 01:23:39,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">They were sending them up into the maze.</font>

952
01:23:40,109 --> 01:23:42,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but not all of us.</font>

953
01:23:42,909 --> 01:23:44,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you mean?</font>

954
01:23:47,890 --> 01:23:49,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, I'm one of them.</font>

955
01:23:52,090 --> 01:23:54,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">The people who put you here,
I worked with them.</font>

956
01:23:56,430 --> 01:23:59,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">I watched you guys for years.</font>

957
01:23:59,659 --> 01:24:02,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">The entire time you have been here...</font>

958
01:24:02,569 --> 01:24:04,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was on the other side of it.</font>

959
01:24:07,409 --> 01:24:08,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">So were you.</font>

960
01:24:10,640 --> 01:24:11,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

961
01:24:13,439 --> 01:24:15,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Teresa, we did this to them.</font>

962
01:24:17,779 --> 01:24:18,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

963
01:24:20,279 --> 01:24:21,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">That can't be true.</font>

964
01:24:22,020 --> 01:24:25,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is. I saw it.</font>

965
01:24:27,090 --> 01:24:29,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would they send us up
if we were with them?</font>

966
01:24:29,859 --> 01:24:31,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">It doesn't matter.</font>

967
01:24:32,829 --> 01:24:34,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's right.</font>

968
01:24:36,970 --> 01:24:38,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">It doesn't matter.</font>

969
01:24:39,369 --> 01:24:41,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any of it.</font>

970
01:24:42,310 --> 01:24:46,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because the people we were before the maze
don't even exist anymore.</font>

971
01:24:46,439 --> 01:24:48,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">These Creators took care of that.</font>

972
01:24:49,710 --> 01:24:53,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">But what does matter is who we are now,
and what we do...</font>

973
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:55,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">right now.</font>

974
01:24:56,220 --> 01:24:58,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">You went into the maze
and you found a way out.</font>

975
01:24:59,189 --> 01:25:02,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but if I hadn't,
Alby would still be alive.</font>

976
01:25:05,729 --> 01:25:07,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe.</font>

977
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:15,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I know that if he were here, he would
be telling you the exact same thing.</font>

978
01:25:16,810 --> 01:25:20,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pick your ass up
and finish what you started.</font>

979
01:25:22,250 --> 01:25:23,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because if we do nothing...</font>

980
01:25:23,710 --> 01:25:27,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">then that means Alby died for nothing,
and I can't have that.</font>

981
01:25:31,390 --> 01:25:32,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

982
01:25:34,659 --> 01:25:38,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, but we gotta get through Gally first.</font>

983
01:26:07,020 --> 01:26:08,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is such a waste.</font>

984
01:26:14,729 --> 01:26:15,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gally...</font>

985
01:26:20,770 --> 01:26:22,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">It doesn't feel right, man.</font>

986
01:26:23,909 --> 01:26:26,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, what if Thomas is right?</font>

987
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:29,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe he can lead us home.</font>

988
01:26:31,449 --> 01:26:33,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are home.</font>

989
01:26:34,079 --> 01:26:35,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay?</font>

990
01:26:36,989 --> 01:26:40,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't wanna have to cross
any more names off that wall.</font>

991
01:26:40,119 --> 01:26:43,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">You really think banishing us
is gonna solve anything?</font>

992
01:26:44,529 --> 01:26:45,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

993
01:26:47,060 --> 01:26:49,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">But this isn't a banishing.</font>

994
01:26:50,029 --> 01:26:51,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's an offering.</font>

995
01:26:51,239 --> 01:26:55,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? Wait!
Gally, what are you doing?</font>

996
01:26:55,369 --> 01:26:59,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">You really think I'm gonna let Thomas
back into the maze after what he has done?</font>

997
01:27:00,810 --> 01:27:02,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look around you!</font>

998
01:27:03,779 --> 01:27:05,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at our Glade!</font>

999
01:27:06,479 --> 01:27:09,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the only way.</font>

1000
01:27:09,590 --> 01:27:12,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">And when the Grievers get
what they came here for...</font>

1001
01:27:13,489 --> 01:27:15,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">everything goes back to the way it was.</font>

1002
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:17,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you listening to this?</font>

1003
01:27:17,159 --> 01:27:19,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you all just standing there?
He's crazy!</font>

1004
01:27:19,699 --> 01:27:20,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">You shut up.</font>

1005
01:27:20,659 --> 01:27:23,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you stay here,
the Grievers are going to come back.</font>

1006
01:27:23,430 --> 01:27:25,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're gonna come back,
and they're gonna keep coming back...</font>

1007
01:27:25,270 --> 01:27:26,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">until you're all dead!</font>

1008
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:28,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut up! Tie him up!</font>

1009
01:27:30,109 --> 01:27:32,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you hear me? I said tie him up!</font>

1010
01:27:57,170 --> 01:27:59,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're full of surprises, aren't you?</font>

1011
01:27:59,140 --> 01:28:02,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have to come with us,
but we are leaving.</font>

1012
01:28:02,340 --> 01:28:04,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyone else who wants to come,
now is your last chance.</font>

1013
01:28:04,779 --> 01:28:06,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't listen to him,
he's just trying to scare you.</font>

1014
01:28:06,479 --> 01:28:09,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I'm not trying to scare you.
You're already scared.</font>

1015
01:28:09,310 --> 01:28:11,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm scared.</font>

1016
01:28:13,619 --> 01:28:17,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I'd rather risk my life out there
than spending the rest of it in here.</font>

1017
01:28:19,060 --> 01:28:21,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't belong here.</font>

1018
01:28:21,659 --> 01:28:24,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">This place isn't our home.</font>

1019
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:27,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were put here.</font>

1020
01:28:27,399 --> 01:28:28,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were trapped here.</font>

1021
01:28:30,699 --> 01:28:32,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">At least, out there we have a choice.</font>

1022
01:28:35,140 --> 01:28:37,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can make it out of here.</font>

1023
01:28:38,479 --> 01:28:39,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know that.</font>

1024
01:28:52,859 --> 01:28:54,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

1025
01:29:08,170 --> 01:29:10,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gally, it's over.</font>

1026
01:29:13,210 --> 01:29:15,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just come with us.</font>

1027
01:29:23,420 --> 01:29:25,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good luck against the Grievers.</font>

1028
01:29:44,409 --> 01:29:45,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody, this way!</font>

1029
01:30:00,060 --> 01:30:02,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep it up, guys, we're almost there!</font>

1030
01:30:16,340 --> 01:30:17,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it a Griever?</font>

1031
01:30:17,810 --> 01:30:19,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

1032
01:30:19,979 --> 01:30:21,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shit.</font>

1033
01:30:21,680 --> 01:30:24,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">You take this, Chuck.
Stay behind us.</font>

1034
01:30:26,250 --> 01:30:28,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay. Just stick with me.</font>

1035
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:32,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once we're through,
it will activate and the door will open.</font>

1036
01:30:32,989 --> 01:30:35,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">We stay close, we stick together...</font>

1037
01:30:35,260 --> 01:30:37,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">we get through this. We get out now...</font>

1038
01:30:37,689 --> 01:30:39,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">or we die trying.</font>

1039
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:41,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ready?</font>

1040
01:30:43,300 --> 01:30:45,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. Let's go!</font>

1041
01:31:00,779 --> 01:31:02,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get up, look out!</font>

1042
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:06,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Push it!</font>

1043
01:31:11,829 --> 01:31:12,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look out!</font>

1044
01:31:21,939 --> 01:31:23,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">The key!</font>

1045
01:31:23,210 --> 01:31:24,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chuck!</font>

1046
01:31:24,310 --> 01:31:25,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Watch the edge!</font>

1047
01:31:32,380 --> 01:31:33,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no.</font>

1048
01:31:34,890 --> 01:31:36,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I got you, Chuck!
- Pull me up!</font>

1049
01:31:47,500 --> 01:31:48,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on!</font>

1050
01:31:49,229 --> 01:31:51,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thomas! Thomas!</font>

1051
01:31:52,199 --> 01:31:53,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chuck?</font>

1052
01:31:53,300 --> 01:31:54,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got more coming!</font>

1053
01:31:56,239 --> 01:31:58,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep it steady, guys!</font>

1054
01:32:00,479 --> 01:32:01,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">It works!</font>

1055
01:32:03,380 --> 01:32:04,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Teresa, go!</font>

1056
01:32:08,520 --> 01:32:10,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't back down! Keep pushing!</font>

1057
01:32:10,220 --> 01:32:11,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay together!</font>

1058
01:32:15,859 --> 01:32:18,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's gotta be a way out! Come on!</font>

1059
01:32:25,170 --> 01:32:26,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Watch it!</font>

1060
01:32:31,409 --> 01:32:33,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">It won't open!</font>

1061
01:32:36,649 --> 01:32:37,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thomas!</font>

1062
01:32:37,750 --> 01:32:39,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a code!</font>

1063
01:32:39,220 --> 01:32:40,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eight numbers!</font>

1064
01:32:42,720 --> 01:32:44,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eight sections of the maze.</font>

1065
01:32:44,189 --> 01:32:46,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Minho! What's the sequence?</font>

1066
01:32:46,220 --> 01:32:47,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

1067
01:32:47,289 --> 01:32:49,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">The sections of the maze,
what's the sequence?</font>

1068
01:32:50,390 --> 01:32:51,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seven! One!</font>

1069
01:32:52,529 --> 01:32:54,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Five! Two!</font>

1070
01:32:54,260 --> 01:32:55,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Six! Four!</font>

1071
01:32:55,369 --> 01:32:56,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heads up!</font>

1072
01:32:58,770 --> 01:32:59,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Minho!</font>

1073
01:33:00,069 --> 01:33:01,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Minho!</font>

1074
01:33:03,909 --> 01:33:05,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get off of me!</font>

1075
01:33:14,479 --> 01:33:15,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeff!</font>

1076
01:33:18,489 --> 01:33:20,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the sequence? Come on!</font>
