- Big on the bottom. Put some sugar on it.</font>

65
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">You embarrass yourself
like what's-his-face.</font>

66
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was truly pathetic.</font>

67
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">Short.</font>

68
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. All right.</font>

69
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's enough of that.
Just back to the core drums, please.</font>

70

<font color="#FFFFFF">Same spot. Three, four.</font>

83
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. All right.</font>

84
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're in the first chair.
Let's see if it's because you're cute.</font>

85
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three, four.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Yep. That's why.</font>

87
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:39,025

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, this one really upsets me.
We have an out-of-tune player here.</font>

155
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:47,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">Before I continue, would that player
care to identify himself?</font>

156
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">No?</font>

157
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,791

<font color="#FFFFFF">No. My ears are fine.</font>

161
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">We definitely have
an out-of-tune player.</font>

162
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoever it is, this is your last chance.</font>

163
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">And there it went.</font>

164
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, either you are deliberately
playing out of tune...</font>

165
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">and sabotaging my band...</font>

166

174
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay. Play.</font>

175
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,630

179
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

180
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,424

181
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've carried your fat ass for too long.</font>

182
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,540

cost us a competition...</font>

183

You were, Erickson.</font>

188
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,142

I don't know if they like me very much.</font>

344
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,220

<font color="#FFFFFF">- And Andy, with your drumming.
- It's going okay, Andy?</font>

446
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:59,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, it's going really,
really well, actually.</font>

447
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm part of Shaffer's
top jazz orchestra...</font>

448
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">which means
it's the best in the country.</font>

449
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:07,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'm a core member...</font>

450
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I'll start playing in competitions.
I just...</font>

451
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">I found out I'm the youngest person
in the band.</font>

452
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:16,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you know who wins in
a music competition? Isn't it subjective?</font>

453
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- Does the studio get you a job?</font>

454
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:21,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not an actual studio.</font>

455
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the name of the ensemble,
but it's a big step forward in my career.</font>

456
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:28,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm so glad you figured it out.
It's a nasty business, I am sure.</font>

457
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, are you gonna tell them
about your game this week?</font>

458
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:34,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Living up to your title.
- I scored a 93-yard touchdown.</font>

459
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">School record, school record.</font>

460
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:40,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is that true? That's fantastic.
- It's Division Three.</font>

461
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:47,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Carlton football. It's not even
Division Two, it's Division Three.</font>

462
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You got any friends, Andy?
- No.</font>

463
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:53,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, why is that?
- I don't know. I never saw the use.</font>

464
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:57,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are you gonna play with otherwise?
Lennon and McCartney were buddies.</font>

465
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:01,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">Charlie Parker didn't know anybody
till Jo Jones threw a cymbal at his head.</font>

466
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:02,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's your idea of success?</font>

467
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Being the greatest musician of the 20th
century is anybody's idea of success.</font>

468
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dying broke and drunk
and full of heroin...</font>

469
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">at the age of 34
is not my idea of success.</font>

470
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:15,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd rather die drunk, broke at 34
and have people talk about me...</font>

471
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:19,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">than live to be rich and sober at 90
and nobody remember who I was.</font>

472
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">But your friends will remember you,
that's the point.</font>

473
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">None of us were friends
with Charlie Parker. That's the point.</font>

474
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:28,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">Travis and Dustin, they have plenty
of friends and plenty of purpose.</font>

475
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'll make great
school board presidents.</font>

476
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think you're better than us?</font>

477
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Catch on quick. Are you in Model UN?
- I got a reply for you.</font>

478
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think Carlton football is a joke?
Come play with us.</font>

479
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:41,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">Four words you will never hear
from the NFL.</font>

480
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:44,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who wants dessert?
- Heard from Lincoln Center?</font>

481
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:21,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, get out of here. Pick up the new
chart by the door on your way out.</font>

482
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:26,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rehearsal 9 p.m. Sharp tonight.
That's how long you have to learn it.</font>

483
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:34,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Neiman. Stick around a minute.</font>

484
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">See the tempo marking on there?</font>

485
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Quarter note equals 330."</font>

486
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:47,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is a double-time swing.</font>

487
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:50,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's what got you in here, right?
- Oh, yeah.</font>

488
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:55,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">As fate would have it,
I recently stumbled across another kid...</font>

489
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:59,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the practice room
working on his double-time swing.</font>

490
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I'm gonna give him a shot.</font>

491
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:04,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Am I late?
- Perfect timing.</font>

492
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on in, Connolly.</font>

493
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:10,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You two know each other, right?
- Yeah, Nassau band.</font>

494
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:11,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's up, Andrew?</font>

495
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:16,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've made Neiman a temporary core,
but with this competition coming up...</font>

496
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:20,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just wanna make very sure
this chart is in the best shape it can be.</font>

497
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:22,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, this one right here, right?</font>

498
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">I gave Connolly the chart this morning.</font>

499
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">All I wanna do is give you both
a crack at it, all right?</font>

500
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, Neiman, go ahead,
jump on the kit, take it from the top.</font>

501
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

502
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want you to worry
about hits now. Just tempo, okay?</font>

503
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:48,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">All set?</font>

504
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:51,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">One, two...</font>

505
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not quite my tempo. Connolly.</font>

506
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:02,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I can take it from the top.
- Connolly, go ahead.</font>

507
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I can do...
- No. We'll go with Connolly now.</font>

508
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, do you mind?</font>

509
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, man, ready?</font>

510
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">One and two and...</font>

511
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Perfect, Connolly.
- Oh, my God.</font>

512
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:36,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, this to me
is the beauty of Studio Band.</font>

513
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:39,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">You walk in here an alternate,
you could be the new core.</font>

514
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:41,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, my God, are you serious?
- Thanks.</font>

515
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:43,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">That shit?</font>

516
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:49,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fletcher.</font>

517
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks, man. Here you go.</font>

518
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:56,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry about Fletcher.
He's more bark than bite.</font>

519
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:05,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, look, you...
I can play these charts.</font>

520
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Now is not the time, I swear to God.
- I can play it, okay?</font>

521
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:12,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">I said not now!
If you want the fucking part, earn it.</font>

522
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:33,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just gonna lay it out there.</font>

523
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is why I don't think
we should be together.</font>

524
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:41,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I've thought about it a lot,
and this is what's gonna happen.</font>

525
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna keep pursuing
what I'm pursuing.</font>

526
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:46,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I'm doing that,
it's gonna take up my time.</font>

527
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:49,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not gonna be able
to spend time with you.</font>

528
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:51,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even when I do,
I'm gonna be thinking about drumming.</font>

529
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:55,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">About jazz, my charts. Because of that,
you're gonna start to resent me.</font>

530
00:50:56,440 --> 00:51:00,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're gonna tell me to ease up on
the drumming, spend more time with you.</font>

531
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:05,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not gonna be able to do that. I'll start
to resent you for even asking me to stop.</font>

532
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:08,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're just gonna start to hate
each other. It's gonna be ugly.</font>

533
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">And so for those reasons...</font>

534
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:14,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd rather just, you know,
break it off clean.</font>

535
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:23,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I wanna be great.</font>

536
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:28,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you're not?</font>

537
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:31,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanna be one of the greats.</font>

538
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I would stop you from doing that?</font>

539
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

540
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know I would stop you
from doing that?</font>

541
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know that for a fact?</font>

542
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:47,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

543
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:52,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'd barely see you anyway?</font>

544
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:57,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah.
- I see you, you'd treat me like shit...</font>

545
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">because I'm some girl
who doesn't know what she wants.</font>

546
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:03,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have a path, you're going
to be great, I'm gonna be forgotten...</font>

547
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:06,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you won't be able
to give me the time of day...</font>

548
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">because you have bigger things
to pursue.</font>

549
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:13,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's exactly my point.</font>

550
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the fuck is wrong with you?</font>

551
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:20,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're right. We should not be dating.</font>

552
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:30,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm okay. Thanks.</font>

553
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck! Fuck!</font>

554
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:05,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fucking piece of shit!</font>

555
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:07,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck you!</font>

556
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:09,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck!</font>

557
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:12,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fucking piece of shit! Come on!</font>

558
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:31,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, we have a new player.
Ryan Connolly.</font>

559
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:37,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

560
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:40,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, just put your instruments
down for a minute.</font>

561
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:56,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just listen for a minute.</font>

562
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:03,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">Six years ago...</font>

563
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:09,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">I came across a kid in a practice room
working on his scales.</font>

564
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:14,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was early second year and he'd
started at Shaffer with a lot of hope.</font>

565
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like all you guys.</font>

566
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:26,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the truth was that he barely
squeaked in to begin with...</font>

567
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he was really struggling.</font>

568
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:39,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">The faculty were all telling him,
"Maybe this isn't for you."</font>

569
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:43,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">But they didn't see what I saw.</font>

570
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:46,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">This scared, skinny kid...</font>

571
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:50,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">cursing himself because he
couldn't get his scales right.</font>

572
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw a drive in him.</font>

573
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:55,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I put him in Studio Band.</font>

574
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:57,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">And when he graduated...</font>

575
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:00,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Marsalis made him third trumpet
at Lincoln Center.</font>

576
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">A year later, he was first.</font>

577
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's who you're listening to now.</font>

578
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:10,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">His name was Sean Casey.</font>

579
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:20,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">I found out this morning...</font>

580
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:23,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">that Sean...</font>

581
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:27,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">died yesterday...</font>

582
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:31,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">in a car accident.</font>

583
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I just...</font>

584
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:42,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanted you guys to know
he was a beautiful player.</font>

585
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:51,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just thought you should know.</font>

586
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

587
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:06,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

588
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:15,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's get to work, huh?
How about "Caravan," bar 105?</font>

589
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:22,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two bars for free.</font>

590
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:25,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">One and two and...</font>

591
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:32,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not quite right, Connolly.</font>

592
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:35,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd like to try Neiman on this.</font>

593
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:43,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe now's the time
for Neiman to earn the part.</font>

594
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:49,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">One and two and...</font>

595
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nope, I guess not. Tanner?</font>

596
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">One and two and...</font>

597
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:09,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Motherfucker!</font>

598
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:14,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">Connolly, get your ass back on the kit.</font>

599
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:24,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">We will stay here for as long as it takes
until one of you fagots can play in time.</font>

600
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:27,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">One and two and...</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Not my fucking tempo!</font>

604
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:44,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, guys.
Hate to put you through this.</font>

605
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:49,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you need to fucking take a dump
or get a coffee...</font>

606
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:51,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">whatever, now might be a good time.</font>

607
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:55,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna stay until I find a drummer
who can fucking play in time.</font>

608
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:58,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">I apologise to the musicians.</font>

609
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:01,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seriously, take 10, 20, a fucking hour.</font>

610
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:04,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">You hear me, cocksuckers?
Better start shitting me perfect 400s.</font>

611
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:07,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">Connolly, get your fucking ass
back on the kit.</font>

612
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:26,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that really the fastest you can play,
you worthless Hymie fuck?</font>

613
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:31,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">No wonder Mommy ran out on you.
Get off the fucking kit.</font>

614
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:39,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">And here comes Mr. Gay Pride
of the Upper West Side himself.</font>

We will not be serving baked Alaska...</font>

616
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:46,824

than you give hand jobs, will you?</font>

617
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:49,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">One, two, one, two.</font>

618
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:53,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not even fucking close.</font>

619
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:55,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go with the Irish Mick
Paddy cracker now.</font>

620
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:59,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, you actually do look
quite a bit like a leprechaun.</font>

621
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:01,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna start calling you Flannery.</font>

622
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:24,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get off!</font>

623
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:30,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you looking for?
There's no gold down there.</font>

624
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">Adjusting the seat? Really?</font>

625
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:34,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's been your problem
the whole time? The seat height?</font>

626
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:36,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">So now you have it, right?</font>

627
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:38,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go.</font>

628
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:44,950

631
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:56,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">to finally bring this home.
What do you say?</font>

632
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">Show me.</font>

633
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:03,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't slow down.</font>

634
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:08,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pick it up.</font>

635
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">Faster!</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Alternates, you wanna clean
the blood off my drum set?</font>

646
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:37,347

<font color="#FFFFFF">5 p.m. Call tomorrow in Dunellen.</font>

648

- You gotta call the cabs.</font>

652

- You gotta call. They take forever.</font>

654
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:34,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey. Come on.
Please, come on. You're still open.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Neiman, where are you, man?
Call time was 5.</font>

658
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,940

I'm almost there. I'm right there.</font>

I'll... I'm gonna be there, okay? Fuck.</font>

663
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:16,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, glad you could fit us
into your busy schedule, darling.</font>

664
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:18,420

<font color="#FFFFFF">What the fuck did you say to me?</font>

667
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:27,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's my part.</font>

668
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:29,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's my part and I decide
who to lend it to.</font>

669
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:34,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">Usually it's somebody
that has fucking sticks.</font>

670
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:38,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">I left them in the car.
I'll be right back. Five minutes.</font>

671
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:39,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm warming up the band now.</font>

672
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:43,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I can use Ryan's sticks.
- Neiman, you lost the fucking part.</font>

673
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:45,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I didn't. You can't do this.</font>

674
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:46,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Can't?
- Yeah.</font>

675
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:49,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">When did you become a fucking expert
on what I can do...</font>

676
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:52,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">- ... you fucking weepy-willow shit sack?
- I earned that part.</font>

677
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:55,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">You never earned anything.
You are a self-righteous prick.</font>

678
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:59,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">The only reason you're a fucking core
is because you misplaced a folder.</font>

679
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:02,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only reason you're in Studio Band
to begin with is because I told you...</font>

680
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:04,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">what I'd be asking for in Nassau.</font>

681
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:06,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Am I wrong?
- Yeah.</font>

682
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:08,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm in Studio Band because I'm the...

01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, fuck off, Johnny Utah.
Turn my pages, bitch.</font>

684
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:14,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey. I can cut you
any fucking time I want.</font>

685
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:17,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You would've cut me by now.
- Try me, you fucking weasel.</font>

686
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:23,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">At 5:30, that's in exactly 11 minutes,
my band is on-stage.</font>

687
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:27,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">If your ass is not on that stool
with your own sticks in hand...</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">one, I will drum your ass
back to Nassau...</font>

690
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:35,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">where you can turn pages
until you graduate or fucking drop out.</font>

691
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:40,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">By the time you're done at Shaffer,
you'll make Daddy look like a success story.</font>

692
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:43,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got it? Or we can let Johnny Utah
play the part.</font>

693
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:46,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You choose.
- That's my part. I'll be on your stage.</font>

694
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:48,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Fuck you.
- You got 10 minutes...</font>

pansy-ass fruit fuck.</font>

696

<font color="#FFFFFF">Left turn, 200 feet.</font>

699
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are you driving, man?
- No.</font>

700
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:12,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell was that noise?</font>

701
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:17,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, why don't you just tell Fletcher
that I'm coming, you motherfucker?</font>

702
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:03,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey. Hey, hey.</font>

703
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:06,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you okay? Are you okay?</font>

704
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:09,340

01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:22,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">To make sure Terence Fletcher is never
allowed to do this to another student.</font>

733
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:49,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Dad, look at my paradiddle.</font>

734
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:54,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, that's my boy.</font>

735
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:58,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He didn't do anything.
- What is wrong with you? It's over, okay?</font>

736
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:01,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's out of your life.
Why would you let him get away?</font>

737
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:05,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you characterize his
conduct as extreme, Andrew?</font>

738
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:08,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did he ever intentionally inflict
emotional distress?</font>

739
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:20,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">This would not be a public hearing,
you know.</font>

740
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:23,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fletcher would never know
it was you who spoke up.</font>

741
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:31,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would you do this to me?</font>

742
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:35,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think that I would let him
put my son through hell...</font>

743
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:38,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then just walk away scot-free?</font>

744
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:41,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you know
I would never let that happen?</font>

745
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:46,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">That there is nothing in the world
more important to me than you?</font>

746
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:48,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you know that?</font>

747
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:01,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">Andrew?</font>

748
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:49,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Andrew?</font>

749
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:56,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just tell me what to say.</font>

750
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:10,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

751
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:31,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd give anything to be there again
this fall.</font>

752
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:33,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like weddings,
provided they're not mine.</font>

753
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:35,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">Marriages are very healthy.</font>

754
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:38,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">Married men live much longer
than bachelors.</font>

755
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:41,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're trying to outlive their wives
so they can be bachelors again.</font>

756
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:44,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Haven't you thought of getting married?
- I did.</font>

757
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:47,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">The young lady changed her mind
at the last moment.</font>

758
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:50,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been deeply indebted
to her ever since.</font>

759
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:52,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I loaded the pantry up with Gushers.</font>

760
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:55,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Saw that.
- Okay.</font>

761
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:56,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

762
01:14:58,080 --> 01:14:59,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks.</font>

763
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:21,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right on, man.</font>

764
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:42,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Andrew.</font>

765
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:48,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

766
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:57,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know if you heard.</font>

767
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:00,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not at Shaffer anymore.</font>

768
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:03,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I did hear that.</font>

769
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:05,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you quit?</font>

770
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not exactly.</font>

771
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:15,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some parents got a kid from
Sean Casey's year, I think...</font>

772
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:18,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">to say some things about me.</font>

773
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:20,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Although why anybody
would have anything...</font>

774
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:24,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">other than peaches and cream
to say about me is a mystery.</font>

775
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:27,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

776
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:30,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's a good laugh, right?
- I'm sorry.</font>

777
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:32,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, listen... I get it.
- I'm sorry.</font>

778
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:34,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know I made enemies.</font>

779
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:38,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm conducting a little, though.</font>

780
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:42,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">They brought back
the JVC Fest this year.</font>

781
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:45,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">They got me opening in a
couple of weeks with a pro band.</font>

782
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:48,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's great.</font>

783
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:51,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. It's all right.</font>

784
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:58,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">Truth is, I don't think
people understood...</font>

785
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:01,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">what it was I was doing at Shaffer.</font>

786
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:03,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wasn't there to conduct.</font>

787
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:07,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any fucking moron can wave
his arms and keep people in tempo.</font>

788
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:12,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was there to push people
beyond what's expected of them.</font>

789
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:16,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe that is...</font>

790
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:19,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">an absolute necessity.</font>

791
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:24,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Otherwise, we're depriving the world
of the next Louis Armstrong.</font>

792
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:26,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">The next Charlie Parker.</font>

793
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:32,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you about how Charlie Parker
became Charlie Parker, right?</font>

794
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:35,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Jo Jones threw a cymbal at his head.
- Exactly.</font>

795
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:37,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Parker's a young kid,
pretty good on the sax.</font>

796
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:42,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gets up to play at a cutting session,
and he fucks it up.</font>

797
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:46,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Jones nearly decapitates him for it.</font>

798
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:49,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he's laughed off-stage.</font>

799
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:53,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cries himself to sleep that night,
but the next morning, what does he do?</font>

800
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:55,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">He practices.</font>

801
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:59,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he practices and he practices
with one goal in mind...</font>

802
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:02,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">never to be laughed at again.</font>

803
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:07,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">And a year later, he goes back to
the Reno and he steps up on that stage...</font>

804
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:11,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">and plays the best motherfucking solo
the world has ever heard.</font>

805
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:17,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">So imagine if Jones had just said:</font>

806
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:22,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Well, that's okay, Charlie.
That was all right. Good job."</font>

807
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:28,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then Charlie thinks to himself,
"Well, shit, I did do a pretty good job."</font>

808
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:30,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">End of story.</font>

809
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:32,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">No Bird.</font>

810
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:37,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">That, to me, is an absolute tragedy.</font>

811
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">But that's just
what the world wants now.</font>

812
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:44,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">People wonder why jazz is dying.</font>

813
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:52,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">I tell you, man,
and every Starbucks "jazz" album...</font>

814
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:55,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">just proves my point, really.</font>

815
01:20:55,880 --> 01:21:00,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are no two words in the
English language more harmful...</font>

816
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:02,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">than "good job."</font>

817
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:09,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">But is there a line?</font>

818
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:14,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, maybe you go too far and
you discourage the next Charlie Parker...</font>

819
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:18,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">- ... from ever becoming Charlie Parker.
- No, man, no.</font>

820
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:21,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because the next Charlie Parker
would never be discouraged.</font>

821
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:23,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

822
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:31,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">The truth is, Andrew...</font>

823
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:36,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never really had a Charlie Parker.</font>

824
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:40,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I tried.</font>

825
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:44,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">I actually fucking tried.</font>

826
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:46,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's more than most people
ever do.</font>

827
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:51,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I will never apologise
for how I tried.</font>

828
01:22:05,240 --> 01:22:06,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll see you later.</font>

829
01:22:06,640 --> 01:22:07,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

830
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:13,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Andrew. Listen, I have no idea
how you're gonna take this...</font>

831
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:19,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">but the band I'm leading for JVC,
my drummer is not cutting it.</font>

832
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:23,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">You understand what I'm saying?</font>

833
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:26,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

834
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:29,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm using the Studio Band playlist.</font>

835
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:32,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, "Caravan,"Whiplash."</font>

836
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:35,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need somebody
who really knows those charts.</font>

837
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:41,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about Ryan Connolly?</font>

838
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:44,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">All Connolly ever was to me
was incentive for you.</font>

839
01:22:46,240 --> 01:22:49,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Tanner?
- Tanner switched to premed.</font>

840
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:52,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess he got discouraged.</font>

841
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:56,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

842
01:22:56,840 --> 01:22:59,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take the weekend. Think about it.</font>

843
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:24,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hello?
- Hey, Nicole, it's Andrew.</font>

844
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:28,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hi.
- Hey.</font>

845
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:35,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's been a while since I talked to you.</font>

846
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:37,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I...</font>

847
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:41,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm really sorry about everything.</font>

848
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:46,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know that's not, you know, enough,
but I'm just really sorry.</font>

849
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:56,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">But anyway, I got...
I actually have this show this weekend.</font>

850
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:58,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a...</font>

851
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:01,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like, a JVC thing. And I didn't know
if maybe you'd wanna go...</font>

852
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:07,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we, you know, maybe
get some, like, pizza afterwards...</font>

853
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:12,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">and, like, complain
about our schools again.</font>

854
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:14,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is...? You said Jayvees?</font>

855
01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:18,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it's JVC.</font>

856
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:22,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like a... It's a jazz thing.</font>

857
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:24,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

858
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:26,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, okay.</font>

859
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:33,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I don't know if I can come. I...
I'll have to check with my boyfriend.</font>

860
01:24:38,280 --> 01:24:39,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

861
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:41,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

862
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:45,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I'll check, but I don't know.</font>

863
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:47,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't really think
he likes jazz music.</font>

864
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:50,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I mean, it's not for everybody.</font>

865
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:57,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Well, I guess
maybe I'll see you guys there.</font>

866
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:01,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay.
- Okay.</font>

867
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:02,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bye.</font>

868
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:30,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, gang, listen up. Now,
for those of you who are new at this...</font>

869
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:34,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">which looks like everybody except Cal,
tonight could change your life.</font>

870
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:40,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">The folks out there make a phone call,
you could be a Blue Note signee...</font>

871
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:44,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">an EMC client, a Lincoln Center core.</font>

872
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:46,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">On the other hand...</font>

873
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:49,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you drop the ball, you might be
looking for a new line of work...</font>

874
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:54,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">because the other thing
about these cats is they never forget.</font>

875
01:26:58,200 --> 01:26:59,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">We all set?</font>

876
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. Let's have fun.</font>

877
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:06,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think I'm fucking stupid?</font>

878
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:10,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
