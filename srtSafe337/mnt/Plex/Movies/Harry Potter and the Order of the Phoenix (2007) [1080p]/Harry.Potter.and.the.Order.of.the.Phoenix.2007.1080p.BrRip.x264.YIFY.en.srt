00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know about you,
it's just too hot today, isn't it?</font>

2
00:00:57,021 --> 00:01:01,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it's going to get even worse.
Temperatures in the mid-30s Celsius...</font>

3
00:01:01,527 --> 00:01:05,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">that's the mid-90s Fahrenheit,
tomorrow, maybe even hitting 100.</font>

4
00:01:05,406 --> 00:01:08,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, please, remember to cover up
and stay cool...</font>

5
00:01:08,242 --> 00:01:11,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">with the hottest hits on your FM dial.</font>

6
00:01:11,245 --> 00:01:13,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, guys, time to go home.</font>

7
00:01:14,748 --> 00:01:16,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, love, off you get.</font>

8
00:01:18,835 --> 00:01:22,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do we have to?
- Yes, we do.</font>

9
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:25,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll make you your favorite dinner
to compensate.</font>

10
00:01:27,177 --> 00:01:28,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">He squealed like a pig, didn't he?</font>

11
00:01:29,013 --> 00:01:32,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, brilliant punch, Big D.
Did you see his face?</font>

12
00:01:32,724 --> 00:01:34,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Big D.</font>

13
00:01:35,436 --> 00:01:37,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">Beat up another 10-year-old?</font>

14
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:39,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This one deserved it.
- Yeah.</font>

15
00:01:40,316 --> 00:01:44,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Five against one, very brave.
- Well, you're one to talk.</font>

16
00:01:44,736 --> 00:01:49,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">Moaning in your sleep every night?
At least I'm not afraid of my pillow.</font>

17
00:01:52,161 --> 00:01:54,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Don't kill Cedric."</font>

18
00:01:55,414 --> 00:01:57,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's Cedric, your boyfriend?</font>

19
00:01:58,417 --> 00:02:02,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Shut up.
- "He's going to kill me, Mum."</font>

20
00:02:02,838 --> 00:02:05,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is your mum?</font>

21
00:02:05,924 --> 00:02:08,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is your mum, Potter?</font>

22
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:10,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">She dead?</font>

23
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:13,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is she dead?</font>

24
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:15,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is she a dead Pott...?</font>

25
00:02:29,657 --> 00:02:31,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Dudley.
- Dudley, let's go.</font>

26
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:36,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's going on?
- What are you doing?</font>

27
00:02:36,372 --> 00:02:39,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm not doing anything.
- We're getting out of here, Dudley.</font>

28
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, Dudley, hurry up.</font>

29
00:03:31,385 --> 00:03:33,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dudley, run.</font>

30
00:04:09,007 --> 00:04:10,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Expecto Patronum.</font>

31
00:04:40,247 --> 00:04:42,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mrs. Figg.</font>

32
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:48,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't put away your wand, Harry.</font>

33
00:04:48,297 --> 00:04:50,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">They might come back.</font>

34
00:04:51,966 --> 00:04:54,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dementors in Little Whinging,
whatever next?</font>

35
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:59,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Whole world's gone topsy-turvy.
- I don't understand. How do you know...?</font>

36
00:04:59,223 --> 00:05:01,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dumbledore asked me
to keep an eye on you.</font>

37
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:04,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dumbledore asked you?
You know Dumbledore?</font>

38
00:05:05,146 --> 00:05:08,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">After You-Know-Who
killed that poor Diggory boy last year...</font>

39
00:05:09,151 --> 00:05:11,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">did you expect him to let you
go wandering on your own?</font>

40
00:05:11,987 --> 00:05:14,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good Lord, boy.
They told me you were intelligent.</font>

41
00:05:14,822 --> 00:05:17,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, get inside and stay there.</font>

42
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:22,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">Expect someone will be in touch soon.
Whatever happens, don't leave the house.</font>

43
00:05:32,216 --> 00:05:34,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is hot. That's right, hot everywhere.</font>

44
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:36,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's sweat. There's stifling.</font>

45
00:05:37,053 --> 00:05:38,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">Diddykins?</font>

46
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:41,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that you?</font>

47
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:47,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">Duddy. Vernon, come quick.</font>

48
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:50,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're going to have to
take him to a hospital.</font>

49
00:05:51,026 --> 00:05:53,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who did this to you, boy?</font>

50
00:05:57,574 --> 00:05:59,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Happy, are we, now?</font>

51
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:03,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've finally done it.
You've finally driven him loopy.</font>

52
00:06:03,497 --> 00:06:06,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">Vernon, don't say that.</font>

53
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, just look at him, Petunia.
Our boy has gone yumpy.</font>

54
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've reached my limit, do you hear?</font>

55
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:17,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the last I'm gonna take
of you and your nonsense.</font>

56
00:06:31,108 --> 00:06:33,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Dear Mr. Potter.
- What?</font>

57
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Ministry has received intelligence
that at 6:23 this evening...</font>

58
00:06:38,781 --> 00:06:43,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">you performed the Patronus Charm
in the presence of a Muggle.</font>

59
00:06:43,745 --> 00:06:45,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">As a clear violation...</font>

60
00:06:45,956 --> 00:06:50,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">of the Decree for the Reasonable
Restriction of Underage Sorcery...</font>

61
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:52,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">you are hereby expelled...</font>

62
00:06:52,754 --> 00:06:56,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">from Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry.</font>

63
00:06:56,925 --> 00:07:01,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hoping you are well, Mafalda Hopkirk.</font>

64
00:07:05,475 --> 00:07:07,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">Justice.</font>

65
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:22,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not very well.</font>

66
00:07:34,797 --> 00:07:36,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, Hedwig.</font>

67
00:08:43,783 --> 00:08:45,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very clean, these Muggles.</font>

68
00:08:45,951 --> 00:08:48,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Tonks, for God's sake.
- Unnatural.</font>

69
00:08:52,792 --> 00:08:54,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Moody.</font>

70
00:08:54,793 --> 00:08:57,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What are you doing here?
- Rescuing you, of course.</font>

71
00:09:00,716 --> 00:09:03,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">But where are we going?
The letter said I've been expelled.</font>

72
00:09:03,595 --> 00:09:06,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">You haven't been. Not yet.
Kingsley, you take point.</font>

73
00:09:06,181 --> 00:09:07,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the letter said...</font>

74
00:09:07,389 --> 00:09:10,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dumbledore persuaded the minister
to suspend your expulsion...</font>

75
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:12,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">pending a formal hearing.
- A hearing?</font>

76
00:09:12,895 --> 00:09:16,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry. We'll explain everything
when we get back to headquarters.</font>

77
00:09:16,441 --> 00:09:18,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not here, Nymphadora.</font>

78
00:09:18,902 --> 00:09:22,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't call me Nymphadora.</font>

79
00:09:28,076 --> 00:09:32,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay in formation, everyone.
Don't break ranks if one of us is killed.</font>

80
00:10:21,965 --> 00:10:24,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, you, around the corner.</font>

81
00:10:26,094 --> 00:10:27,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

82
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:08,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">In you go, son.</font>

83
00:11:10,304 --> 00:11:11,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">There've been no sightings.</font>

84
00:11:11,972 --> 00:11:13,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">No deaths. No proof.</font>

85
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:16,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">He almost killed Harry.
If that isn't proof enough...</font>

86
00:11:16,894 --> 00:11:20,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, but guarding you-know-what
is the most important...</font>

87
00:11:23,109 --> 00:11:25,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">We must trust Dumbledore on this.</font>

88
00:11:25,695 --> 00:11:30,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was he able to protect Harry last year?
Tonight I say it's time to take action.</font>

89
00:11:30,283 --> 00:11:33,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cornelius Fudge is a politician first
and a wizard second.</font>

90
00:11:33,661 --> 00:11:36,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">- His instinct would be to ignore it...
- Keep your voices down.</font>

91
00:11:36,998 --> 00:11:41,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's getting stronger and stronger
by the minute. We have to act now.</font>

92
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Harry.
- Mrs. Weasley.</font>

93
00:11:50,345 --> 00:11:52,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heavens, you're all right.</font>

94
00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:00,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bit peaky, but I'm afraid dinner will wait
until after the meeting's finished.</font>

95
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:05,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nope. No time to explain.
Straight upstairs, first door on the left.</font>

96
00:12:05,735 --> 00:12:07,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

97
00:12:09,447 --> 00:12:14,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mudblood, werewolves,
traitors, thieves.</font>

98
00:12:14,827 --> 00:12:19,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">If my poor mistress
knew the scum they let into her house...</font>

99
00:12:19,874 --> 00:12:22,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">what would she say to old Kreacher?</font>

100
00:12:23,211 --> 00:12:26,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, the shame.</font>

101
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Freaks.
- There, there, mistress.</font>

102
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Scum of the earth.
Not like it was in the days of my fathers.</font>

103
00:12:45,066 --> 00:12:47,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kreacher is here.</font>

104
00:12:51,739 --> 00:12:53,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Harry.</font>

105
00:12:55,994 --> 00:12:59,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you all right? We overheard them
talking about the Dementor attack.</font>

106
00:12:59,998 --> 00:13:02,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You must tell us everything.
- Let the man breathe, Hermione.</font>

107
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">And this hearing at the Ministry.
It's just outrageous.</font>

108
00:13:07,379 --> 00:13:09,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've looked it up.
They simply can't expel you.</font>

109
00:13:09,716 --> 00:13:12,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's completely unfair.
- Yeah.</font>

110
00:13:12,927 --> 00:13:15,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a lot of that
going round at the moment.</font>

111
00:13:17,432 --> 00:13:19,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, what is this place?</font>

112
00:13:19,558 --> 00:13:22,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's headquarters.
- Of the Order of the Phoenix.</font>

113
00:13:23,062 --> 00:13:24,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a secret society.</font>

114
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:27,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dumbledore formed it back when
they fought You-Know-Who.</font>

115
00:13:27,442 --> 00:13:30,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">Couldn't have put any of this
in a letter, I suppose?</font>

116
00:13:30,695 --> 00:13:32,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've gone all summer
without a scrap of news.</font>

117
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:37,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">We wanted to write, mate.
Really, we did.</font>

118
00:13:37,286 --> 00:13:38,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Only...
- Only what?</font>

119
00:13:38,495 --> 00:13:41,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only Dumbledore made us swear
not to tell you anything.</font>

120
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dumbledore said that?</font>

121
00:13:47,004 --> 00:13:49,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">But why would he keep me in the dark?
Maybe I could help.</font>

122
00:13:49,923 --> 00:13:51,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm the one
who saw Voldemort return...</font>

123
00:13:52,051 --> 00:13:54,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">the one who fought him,
who saw Cedric Diggory get killed.</font>

124
00:13:55,053 --> 00:13:57,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Harry.
- Thought we heard your dulcet tones.</font>

125
00:13:57,431 --> 00:14:01,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Don't bottle it up, though. Let it out.
- If you're all done shouting...</font>

126
00:14:01,644 --> 00:14:04,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you wanna hear something
a little more interesting?</font>

127
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">If anyone has a right to know, it's Harry.
If it wasn't for Harry...</font>

128
00:14:08,984 --> 00:14:11,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">we wouldn't even know
Voldemort was back.</font>

129
00:14:11,195 --> 00:14:12,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not a child, Molly.</font>

130
00:14:12,947 --> 00:14:15,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">But he's not an adult either.</font>

131
00:14:15,615 --> 00:14:18,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He's not James, Sirius.
- Well, he's not your son.</font>

132
00:14:18,701 --> 00:14:20,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's as good as.</font>

133
00:14:21,246 --> 00:14:22,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who else has he got?
- Hey, Ginny.</font>

134
00:14:23,124 --> 00:14:25,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He's got me.
- How touchingly paternal, Black.</font>

135
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:28,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps Potter will grow up
to be a felon, just like his godfather.</font>

136
00:14:29,004 --> 00:14:30,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, you stay out of this, Snivellus.</font>

137
00:14:30,923 --> 00:14:33,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Snape's part of the Order?
- Git.</font>

138
00:14:33,174 --> 00:14:35,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">- About your supposed reformation.</font>

139
00:14:35,177 --> 00:14:37,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I know better.
- So why don't you tell him?</font>

140
00:14:38,096 --> 00:14:39,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Get off it.
- Quick.</font>

141
00:14:39,974 --> 00:14:41,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Get it up.
- Crookshanks.</font>

142
00:14:42,017 --> 00:14:44,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Stop it.
- Get off, you bloody cat.</font>

143
00:14:44,352 --> 00:14:46,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Crookshanks. Leave it alone.
- Get it up.</font>

144
00:14:48,566 --> 00:14:52,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hermione, I hate your cat.
- Bad Crookshanks.</font>

145
00:14:53,486 --> 00:14:56,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we'll be eating
down in the kitchen.</font>

146
00:14:57,073 --> 00:14:59,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just because you're allowed
to use magic now...</font>

147
00:14:59,576 --> 00:15:02,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">does not mean you have to
whip your wands out for everything.</font>

148
00:15:02,788 --> 00:15:04,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, Mum.</font>

149
00:15:05,374 --> 00:15:07,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">You hungry, Harry?</font>

150
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">You sure you're all right, Harry?
Gave us quite a turn.</font>

151
00:15:10,044 --> 00:15:12,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry Potter.</font>

152
00:15:14,424 --> 00:15:16,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sirius.</font>

153
00:15:21,974 --> 00:15:24,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is very, very peculiar.</font>

154
00:15:24,393 --> 00:15:28,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">It seems your hearing in the Ministry
is to be before the entire Wizengamot.</font>

155
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:31,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't understand. What has
the Ministry of Magic got against me?</font>

156
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:36,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Show him. He'll find out soon enough.</font>

157
00:15:46,414 --> 00:15:49,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's been attacking Dumbledore as well.</font>

158
00:15:51,253 --> 00:15:56,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fudge is using all his power, including
his influence at the Daily Prophet...</font>

159
00:15:56,591 --> 00:15:59,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">to smear anyone who claims
the Dark Lord has returned.</font>

160
00:15:59,761 --> 00:16:01,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

161
00:16:01,221 --> 00:16:03,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">He thinks Dumbledore's after his job.</font>

162
00:16:03,349 --> 00:16:05,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one in their right mind
could believe that...</font>

163
00:16:05,643 --> 00:16:08,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Exactly the point.
Fudge isn't in his right mind.</font>

164
00:16:08,687 --> 00:16:11,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's been twisted and warped by fear.</font>

165
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:15,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, fear makes people
do terrible things, Harry.</font>

166
00:16:15,485 --> 00:16:17,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">The last time
Voldemort gained power...</font>

167
00:16:18,113 --> 00:16:21,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">he almost destroyed
everything we hold most dear.</font>

168
00:16:21,616 --> 00:16:25,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now he's returned, and I'm afraid
the minister will do almost anything...</font>

169
00:16:25,703 --> 00:16:28,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">to avoid facing that terrifying truth.</font>

170
00:16:29,917 --> 00:16:34,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">We think Voldemort
wants to build up his army again.</font>

171
00:16:35,713 --> 00:16:38,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fourteen years ago,
he had huge numbers at his command.</font>

172
00:16:38,551 --> 00:16:43,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">And not just witches and wizards,
but all manner of dark creatures.</font>

173
00:16:43,721 --> 00:16:47,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's been recruiting heavily, and we've
been attempting to do the same.</font>

174
00:16:48,686 --> 00:16:52,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">But gathering followers
isn't the only thing he's interested in.</font>

175
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">We believe...</font>

176
00:16:58,195 --> 00:17:00,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Voldemort may be after something.</font>

177
00:17:00,322 --> 00:17:01,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sirius.</font>

178
00:17:05,076 --> 00:17:07,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something he didn't have last time.</font>

179
00:17:09,414 --> 00:17:11,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">You mean like a weapon?</font>

180
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:15,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. That's enough. He's just a boy.</font>

181
00:17:15,837 --> 00:17:18,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">You say more and you might as well
induct him into the Order.</font>

182
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:22,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good. I want to join. If Voldemort's
raising an army, then I want to fight.</font>

183
00:17:35,106 --> 00:17:36,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry.</font>

184
00:17:37,151 --> 00:17:39,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are hereby expelled.</font>

185
00:17:39,569 --> 00:17:42,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">Before the entire Wizengamot.</font>

186
00:17:51,707 --> 00:17:53,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Trains. Underground.</font>

187
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:55,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ingenious, these Muggles.</font>

188
00:18:13,144 --> 00:18:14,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here we are.</font>

189
00:18:16,773 --> 00:18:21,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never used the visitors' entrance
before. Should be fun.</font>

190
00:18:21,945 --> 00:18:26,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right. Good.
I'll just get my Muggle money.</font>

191
00:19:06,282 --> 00:19:09,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">Terrible. Lost a lot of Galleons
trading on the potions market.</font>

192
00:19:09,368 --> 00:19:12,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">Daily Prophet, ladies and gentlemen.
Anybody for Daily Prophet?</font>

193
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:15,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is he daft,
or is he dangerous?</font>

194
00:19:37,814 --> 00:19:40,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Morning, Arthur.
- Morning, Bob.</font>

195
00:19:43,236 --> 00:19:44,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">Interdepartmental memos.</font>

196
00:19:44,988 --> 00:19:48,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">We used to use owls.
Mess was unbelievable.</font>

197
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:57,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Merlin's beard. Thank you, Kingsley.</font>

198
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:59,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">They've changed the time
of your hearing.</font>

199
00:19:59,669 --> 00:20:01,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">When is it?</font>

200
00:20:01,462 --> 00:20:03,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">In five minutes.</font>

201
00:20:11,013 --> 00:20:14,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">Department of Mysteries.</font>

202
00:20:16,769 --> 00:20:20,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'm confident, minister,
that you will do the right thing.</font>

203
00:20:21,066 --> 00:20:23,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, but we must be...</font>

204
00:20:30,325 --> 00:20:33,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember, during the hearing,
speak only when you're spoken to.</font>

205
00:20:33,912 --> 00:20:37,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep calm.
You've done nothing wrong.</font>

206
00:20:37,749 --> 00:20:41,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">As the Muggles say, truth will out.</font>

207
00:20:41,545 --> 00:20:42,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes?</font>

208
00:20:44,047 --> 00:20:46,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not allowed in, I'm afraid.</font>

209
00:20:48,009 --> 00:20:49,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good luck, Harry.</font>

210
00:20:53,722 --> 00:20:56,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">Disciplinary hearing
of the 12th of August...</font>

211
00:20:56,393 --> 00:20:59,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">into offenses committed
by Harry James Potter...</font>

212
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">resident at Number 4 Privet Drive,
Little Whinging, Surrey.</font>

213
00:21:03,316 --> 00:21:06,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cornelius Oswald Fudge,
Minister of Mag...</font>

214
00:21:06,569 --> 00:21:08,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">Witness for the defense.</font>

215
00:21:08,571 --> 00:21:11,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Albus Percival Wulfric...</font>

216
00:21:12,075 --> 00:21:15,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brian Dumbledore.</font>

217
00:21:15,787 --> 00:21:19,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got our message
that the time and place of the hearing...</font>

218
00:21:19,249 --> 00:21:21,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">had been changed, did you?
- I must have missed it.</font>

219
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">But by a happy mistake, I arrived
at the Ministry three hours early.</font>

220
00:21:28,884 --> 00:21:30,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">The charges?</font>

221
00:21:30,259 --> 00:21:32,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">The charges against the accused
are as follows:</font>

222
00:21:32,929 --> 00:21:34,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">"That he did knowingly...</font>

223
00:21:34,763 --> 00:21:38,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">and in full awareness
of the illegality of his actions...</font>

224
00:21:38,477 --> 00:21:41,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">produce a Patronus Charm...</font>

225
00:21:41,645 --> 00:21:44,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the presence of a Muggle."</font>

226
00:21:45,066 --> 00:21:48,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do you deny producing said Patronus?
- No, but...</font>

227
00:21:48,528 --> 00:21:51,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you were aware that you were
forbidden to use magic outside school...</font>

228
00:21:52,156 --> 00:21:55,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">while under the age of 17?
- Yes, I was, but...</font>

229
00:21:55,201 --> 00:21:58,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Witches and wizards
of the Wizengamot...</font>

230
00:21:58,747 --> 00:22:00,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was only doing it
because of the Dementors.</font>

231
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:05,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dementors?</font>

232
00:22:05,961 --> 00:22:07,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">In Little Whinging?</font>

233
00:22:07,798 --> 00:22:10,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's quite clever.</font>

234
00:22:10,299 --> 00:22:13,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Muggles can't see Dementors,
can they, boy?</font>

235
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Highly convenient.
- I'm not lying.</font>

236
00:22:16,013 --> 00:22:18,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">- There were two of them, if I hadn't...
- Enough.</font>

237
00:22:18,767 --> 00:22:22,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry to interrupt what I'm sure
would be a very well-rehearsed story...</font>

238
00:22:23,145 --> 00:22:27,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">but since you can produce
no witnesses of the event...</font>

239
00:22:27,817 --> 00:22:32,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pardon me, minister,
but as it happens, we can.</font>

240
00:22:35,741 --> 00:22:38,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please describe the attack.</font>

241
00:22:41,623 --> 00:22:43,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did they look like?</font>

242
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, one of them was very large
and the other rather skinny.</font>

243
00:22:50,507 --> 00:22:53,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not the boys. The Dementors.</font>

244
00:22:53,509 --> 00:22:57,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, right, right. Well, big.</font>

245
00:22:58,347 --> 00:23:02,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cloaked. Then everything went cold...</font>

246
00:23:03,603 --> 00:23:07,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">as though all the happiness
had gone from the world.</font>

247
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:12,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, look here. Dementors don't just
wander into a Muggle suburb...</font>

248
00:23:12,444 --> 00:23:16,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">and happen across a wizard.
The odds are astronomical.</font>

249
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think anyone would believe...</font>

250
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">the Dementors were there
by coincidence, minister.</font>

251
00:23:23,707 --> 00:23:26,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure I must have misunderstood you,
professor.</font>

252
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:32,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dementors are, after all, under
the control of the Ministry of Magic.</font>

253
00:23:32,423 --> 00:23:36,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it's so silly of me, but it sounded
for a moment as though...</font>

254
00:23:36,802 --> 00:23:40,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">you were suggesting that the Ministry
had ordered the attack on this boy.</font>

255
00:23:40,973 --> 00:23:43,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">That would be disturbing indeed,
Madam Undersecretary...</font>

256
00:23:43,934 --> 00:23:48,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">which is why I'm sure the Ministry
will be mounting a full-scale inquiry...</font>

257
00:23:48,273 --> 00:23:51,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">into why the two Dementors
were so very far from Azkaban...</font>

258
00:23:51,818 --> 00:23:55,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">and why they mounted an attack
without authorization.</font>

259
00:23:56,073 --> 00:23:58,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course, there is someone...</font>

260
00:23:58,617 --> 00:24:01,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">who might be behind the attack.</font>

261
00:24:04,248 --> 00:24:08,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cornelius, I implore you to see reason.</font>

262
00:24:09,045 --> 00:24:13,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">The evidence that the Dark Lord
has returned is incontrovertible.</font>

263
00:24:13,758 --> 00:24:16,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">He is not back.</font>

264
00:24:22,432 --> 00:24:24,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the matter of Harry Potter...</font>

265
00:24:25,228 --> 00:24:27,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">the law clearly states...</font>

266
00:24:27,896 --> 00:24:32,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">that magic may be used before
Muggles in life-threatening situations.</font>

267
00:24:32,442 --> 00:24:35,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Laws can be changed if necessary,
Dumbledore.</font>

268
00:24:35,529 --> 00:24:38,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clearly. Has it become practice
to hold a full criminal trial...</font>

269
00:24:38,865 --> 00:24:41,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">to deal with a simple matter
of underage magic?</font>

270
00:24:50,127 --> 00:24:53,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those in favor of conviction?</font>

271
00:25:02,515 --> 00:25:07,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those in favor
of clearing the accused of all charges?</font>

272
00:25:21,576 --> 00:25:23,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cleared of all charges.</font>

273
00:25:26,873 --> 00:25:28,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor.</font>

274
00:25:41,554 --> 00:25:44,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Padfoot. Are you barking mad?</font>

275
00:25:44,807 --> 00:25:47,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll blow the entire operation.</font>

276
00:25:55,567 --> 00:25:58,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sirius, what are you doing here?
If somebody sees you...</font>

277
00:25:58,362 --> 00:26:00,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had to see you off, didn't I?</font>

278
00:26:02,784 --> 00:26:05,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's life without a little risk?</font>

279
00:26:05,494 --> 00:26:07,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't wanna see you
get chucked back in Azkaban.</font>

280
00:26:07,997 --> 00:26:09,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry about me.</font>

281
00:26:09,874 --> 00:26:14,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyway, I wanted you to have this.</font>

282
00:26:20,259 --> 00:26:23,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">Original Order of the Phoenix.</font>

283
00:26:23,846 --> 00:26:25,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">Marlene McKinnon.</font>

284
00:26:25,722 --> 00:26:28,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was killed
two weeks after this was taken.</font>

285
00:26:28,683 --> 00:26:31,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">Voldemort wiped out her entire family.</font>

286
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:34,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frank and Alice Longbottom.</font>

287
00:26:34,231 --> 00:26:35,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">Neville's parents.</font>

288
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:39,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">They suffered a fate worse than death,
you ask me.</font>

289
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:43,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's been 14 years.</font>

290
00:26:44,826 --> 00:26:49,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">And still a day doesn't go by
I don't miss your dad.</font>

291
00:26:53,709 --> 00:26:56,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you really think
there's going to be a war, Sirius?</font>

292
00:26:59,048 --> 00:27:02,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">It feels like it did before.</font>

293
00:27:06,305 --> 00:27:08,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">You keep it.</font>

294
00:27:08,598 --> 00:27:12,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyway, I suppose
you're the young ones now.</font>

295
00:27:15,189 --> 00:27:17,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll see you at the train.</font>

296
00:27:17,191 --> 00:27:19,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bye-bye, darling.</font>

297
00:27:20,111 --> 00:27:21,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love you.</font>

298
00:27:22,363 --> 00:27:24,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold my hand, lovey.</font>

299
00:27:24,615 --> 00:27:26,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">There they are.
They're in the far carriage.</font>

300
00:27:27,076 --> 00:27:28,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bye.</font>

301
00:28:10,577 --> 00:28:13,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm surprised the Ministry's
still letting you walk around free.</font>

302
00:28:13,663 --> 00:28:15,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">Better enjoy it while you can.</font>

303
00:28:15,333 --> 00:28:18,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">I expect there's a cell in Azkaban
with your name on it.</font>

304
00:28:21,213 --> 00:28:25,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What'd I tell you? Complete nutter.
- Just stay away from me!</font>

305
00:28:26,384 --> 00:28:28,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's only Malfoy.</font>

306
00:28:29,055 --> 00:28:30,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">What'd you expect?</font>

307
00:28:50,868 --> 00:28:52,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, guys.</font>

308
00:28:52,203 --> 00:28:53,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey, Neville.
- Hey there, Neville.</font>

309
00:29:06,926 --> 00:29:08,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it?</font>

310
00:29:10,638 --> 00:29:13,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's what?
- That. Pulling the carriage.</font>

311
00:29:14,726 --> 00:29:17,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing's pulling the carriage, Harry.</font>

312
00:29:17,688 --> 00:29:19,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's pulling itself, like always.</font>

313
00:29:33,537 --> 00:29:35,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not going mad.</font>

314
00:29:38,333 --> 00:29:40,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can see them too.</font>

315
00:29:41,836 --> 00:29:44,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're just as sane as I am.</font>

316
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone, this is Loony Love...</font>

317
00:29:54,098 --> 00:29:56,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">Luna Lovegood.</font>

318
00:29:59,938 --> 00:30:02,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">What an interesting necklace.</font>

319
00:30:02,816 --> 00:30:04,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a charm, actually.</font>

320
00:30:06,361 --> 00:30:07,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keeps away the Nargles.</font>

321
00:30:11,741 --> 00:30:13,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hungry.</font>

322
00:30:13,911 --> 00:30:15,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope there's pudding.</font>

323
00:30:16,872 --> 00:30:20,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's a Nargle?
- No idea.</font>

324
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good evening, children.</font>

325
00:30:36,098 --> 00:30:38,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, we have two changes
in staffing this year.</font>

326
00:30:38,977 --> 00:30:42,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're pleased to welcome back
Professor Grubbly-Plank...</font>

327
00:30:42,189 --> 00:30:44,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">who'll be taking
Care of Magical Creatures...</font>

328
00:30:44,942 --> 00:30:48,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">while Professor Hagrid
is on temporary leave.</font>

329
00:30:49,238 --> 00:30:53,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">We also wish to welcome our new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher...</font>

330
00:30:53,407 --> 00:30:56,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Dolores Umbridge.</font>

331
00:30:56,869 --> 00:31:00,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'm sure you'll all join me
in wishing the professor good luck.</font>

332
00:31:01,415 --> 00:31:06,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, as usual, our caretaker, Mr. Filch,
has asked me to remind you...</font>

333
00:31:17,516 --> 00:31:20,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was at my hearing.
She works for Fudge.</font>

334
00:31:20,394 --> 00:31:26,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, headmaster,
for those kind words of welcome.</font>

335
00:31:27,483 --> 00:31:31,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">And how lovely to see all your bright...</font>

336
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:34,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">happy faces smiling up at me.</font>

337
00:31:34,532 --> 00:31:39,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure we're all going
to be very good friends.</font>

338
00:31:39,872 --> 00:31:42,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's likely.
- That's likely.</font>

339
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Ministry of Magic
has always considered...</font>

340
00:31:48,087 --> 00:31:53,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">the education of young witches
and wizards to be of vital importance.</font>

341
00:31:54,051 --> 00:31:56,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Although each headmaster...</font>

342
00:31:56,512 --> 00:32:01,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">has brought something new
to this historic school...</font>

343
00:32:02,894 --> 00:32:09,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">progress for the sake of progress
must be discouraged.</font>

344
00:32:09,776 --> 00:32:13,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let us preserve
what must be preserved...</font>

345
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:17,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">perfect what can be perfected...</font>

346
00:32:17,451 --> 00:32:24,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">and prune practices
that ought to be prohibited.</font>

347
00:32:31,131 --> 00:32:35,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, Professor Umbridge.
That really was most illuminating.</font>

348
00:32:35,426 --> 00:32:39,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Illuminating? What a load of waffle.
- What's it mean?</font>

349
00:32:40,516 --> 00:32:42,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">Magic is forbidden in the corridors...</font>

350
00:32:42,851 --> 00:32:46,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">It means the Ministry's
interfering at Hogwarts.</font>

351
00:33:06,208 --> 00:33:07,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dean, Seamus.</font>

352
00:33:08,251 --> 00:33:10,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Good holiday?
- All right.</font>

353
00:33:10,753 --> 00:33:12,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">Better than Seamus', anyway.</font>

354
00:33:14,298 --> 00:33:16,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me mum didn't want me
to come back this year.</font>

355
00:33:16,801 --> 00:33:20,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why not?
- Let me see. Because of you.</font>

356
00:33:20,513 --> 00:33:23,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Daily Prophet's been saying a lot
of things about you and Dumbledore.</font>

357
00:33:24,058 --> 00:33:25,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, your mum believes them?</font>

358
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody was there
the night Cedric died.</font>

359
00:33:27,645 --> 00:33:30,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess you should read the Prophet,
then, like your stupid mother.</font>

360
00:33:30,898 --> 00:33:34,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Don't talk about my mother.
- I'll have a go at anyone calling me a liar.</font>

361
00:33:34,569 --> 00:33:37,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's going on?
- He's mad, is what's going on.</font>

362
00:33:37,239 --> 00:33:40,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you believe the rubbish he's
come out with about You-Know-Who?</font>

363
00:33:40,491 --> 00:33:42,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. I do.</font>

364
00:33:43,162 --> 00:33:45,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">Has anyone else
got a problem with Harry?</font>

365
00:33:54,548 --> 00:33:56,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You all right?
- Fine.</font>

366
00:33:57,134 --> 00:33:59,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seamus was bang out of order, mate.</font>

367
00:34:00,512 --> 00:34:04,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But he'll come through, you'll see.
- I said, I'm fine, Ron.</font>

368
00:34:07,936 --> 00:34:12,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right. I'll just leave you
to your thoughts, then.</font>

369
00:34:40,762 --> 00:34:41,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry.</font>

370
00:34:57,237 --> 00:34:59,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bring it over here. Over here.</font>

371
00:35:00,322 --> 00:35:03,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, go on, Seamus. Go on, get it.</font>

372
00:35:18,842 --> 00:35:20,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good morning, children.</font>

373
00:35:22,262 --> 00:35:27,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ordinary Wizarding Level examinations.</font>

374
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:30,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">O-W-Is.</font>

375
00:35:30,353 --> 00:35:34,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">More commonly known as OWLs.</font>

376
00:35:35,108 --> 00:35:38,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Study hard and you will be rewarded.</font>

377
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:43,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fail to do so,
and the consequences may be severe.</font>

378
00:35:49,414 --> 00:35:54,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your previous instruction in this subject
has been disturbingly uneven.</font>

379
00:35:54,626 --> 00:35:56,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you'll be pleased to know,
from now on...</font>

380
00:35:56,963 --> 00:36:00,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">you will be following a carefully
structured, Ministry-approved...</font>

381
00:36:00,632 --> 00:36:03,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">course of defensive magic. Yes?</font>

382
00:36:04,637 --> 00:36:07,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's nothing in here
about using defensive spells?</font>

383
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:08,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">Using spells?</font>

384
00:36:09,141 --> 00:36:12,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I can't imagine why you would
need to use spells in my classroom.</font>

385
00:36:14,313 --> 00:36:15,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not gonna use magic?</font>

386
00:36:16,065 --> 00:36:21,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll be learning about defensive spells
in a secure, risk-free way.</font>

387
00:36:21,237 --> 00:36:23,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">What use is that?
If we're attacked, it won't be risk-free.</font>

388
00:36:24,157 --> 00:36:27,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">Students will raise their hands
when they speak in my class.</font>

389
00:36:30,746 --> 00:36:33,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is the view of the Ministry...</font>

390
00:36:33,333 --> 00:36:36,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">that a theoretical knowledge
will be sufficient...</font>

391
00:36:36,251 --> 00:36:38,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">to get you through
your examinations...</font>

392
00:36:38,378 --> 00:36:40,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">which, after all,
is what school is all about.</font>

393
00:36:41,007 --> 00:36:43,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">And how's theory supposed
to prepare us for what's out there?</font>

394
00:36:43,967 --> 00:36:46,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is nothing out there, dear.</font>

395
00:36:46,179 --> 00:36:49,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who do you imagine
wants to attack children like yourself?</font>

396
00:36:49,349 --> 00:36:52,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I don't know.
Maybe Lord Voldemort.</font>

397
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:07,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, let me make this quite plain.</font>

398
00:37:08,367 --> 00:37:09,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have been told...</font>

399
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:15,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">that a certain dark wizard
is at large once again.</font>

400
00:37:15,541 --> 00:37:20,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This is a lie.
- It's not a lie. I saw him. I fought him.</font>

401
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:22,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">Detention, Mr. Potter.</font>

402
00:37:22,632 --> 00:37:24,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cedric Diggory dropped dead
of his own accord?</font>

403
00:37:24,967 --> 00:37:27,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cedric Diggory's death
was a tragic accident.</font>

404
00:37:27,554 --> 00:37:29,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was murder. Voldemort killed him.</font>

405
00:37:29,889 --> 00:37:31,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enough!</font>

406
00:37:32,057 --> 00:37:33,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enough.</font>

407
00:37:33,893 --> 00:37:38,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">See me later, Mr. Potter. My office.</font>

408
00:38:02,963 --> 00:38:04,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come in.</font>

409
00:38:09,429 --> 00:38:11,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good evening, Mr. Potter.</font>

410
00:38:11,972 --> 00:38:13,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sit.</font>

411
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:24,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're going to be doing some lines
for me today, Mr. Potter.</font>

412
00:38:25,027 --> 00:38:26,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, not with your quill.</font>

413
00:38:27,112 --> 00:38:30,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">Going to be using
a rather special one of mine.</font>

414
00:38:35,454 --> 00:38:36,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now...</font>

415
00:38:37,831 --> 00:38:43,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to write,
"I must not tell lies."</font>

416
00:38:45,798 --> 00:38:47,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many times?</font>

417
00:38:48,134 --> 00:38:52,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, let's say for as long as it takes
for the message to sink in.</font>

418
00:38:54,807 --> 00:38:56,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">You haven't given me any ink.</font>

419
00:38:56,643 --> 00:38:58,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you won't need any ink.</font>

420
00:39:49,362 --> 00:39:50,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes?</font>

421
00:39:58,204 --> 00:40:01,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Nothing.
- That's right.</font>

422
00:40:02,501 --> 00:40:06,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because you know, deep down...</font>

423
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:08,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">you deserve to be punished.</font>

424
00:40:09,884 --> 00:40:12,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you, Mr. Potter?</font>

425
00:40:16,264 --> 00:40:17,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on.</font>

426
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:29,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Skiving Snackboxes.
- Sweets that make you ill.</font>

427
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out of class whenever you like.</font>

428
00:40:31,155 --> 00:40:34,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Obtain hours of pleasure
from unprofitable boredom.</font>

429
00:40:35,909 --> 00:40:37,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">Care for another?</font>

430
00:40:37,411 --> 00:40:39,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm not asking you to write all of it.
- Please.</font>

431
00:40:40,121 --> 00:40:43,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been busy studying
for these stupid OWL exams.</font>

432
00:40:43,583 --> 00:40:45,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll do the introduction. That's all.</font>

433
00:40:45,543 --> 00:40:49,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hermione, you're honestly the most
wonderful person I've ever met.</font>

434
00:40:49,465 --> 00:40:53,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And if I'm ever rude to you again...
- I'll know you've gone back to normal.</font>

435
00:40:58,766 --> 00:41:00,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's wrong with your hand?</font>

436
00:41:01,393 --> 00:41:02,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing.</font>

437
00:41:04,103 --> 00:41:06,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">The other hand.</font>

438
00:41:08,525 --> 00:41:10,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You've got to tell Dumbledore.
- No.</font>

439
00:41:10,527 --> 00:41:12,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dumbledore's got enough
on his mind right now.</font>

440
00:41:12,905 --> 00:41:15,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to give
Umbridge the satisfaction.</font>

441
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:17,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bloody hell, Harry.
The woman's torturing you.</font>

442
00:41:17,784 --> 00:41:21,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">- If the parents knew about this...
- I haven't got any of those, have I, Ron?</font>

443
00:41:24,541 --> 00:41:27,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry, you've got to report this.</font>

444
00:41:27,168 --> 00:41:30,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's perfectly simple. You're being...
- No, it's not.</font>

445
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hermione, whatever this is,
it's not simple.</font>

446
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't understand.</font>

447
00:41:39,389 --> 00:41:41,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then help us to.</font>

448
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:57,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dear Padfoot...</font>

449
00:41:58,451 --> 00:42:00,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope you're all right.</font>

450
00:42:00,327 --> 00:42:04,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's starting to get colder here.
Winter is definitely on the way.</font>

451
00:42:07,585 --> 00:42:12,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">In spite of being back at Hogwarts,
I feel more alone than ever.</font>

452
00:42:13,173 --> 00:42:16,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you, of all people,
will understand.</font>

453
00:42:50,585 --> 00:42:52,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Harry Potter.</font>

454
00:42:55,423 --> 00:43:00,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Your feet. Aren't they cold?
- Bit.</font>

455
00:43:00,971 --> 00:43:05,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unfortunately, all my shoes
have mysteriously disappeared.</font>

456
00:43:05,559 --> 00:43:08,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">I suspect Nargles are behind it.</font>

457
00:43:14,985 --> 00:43:18,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What are they?
- They're called Thestrals.</font>

458
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:24,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're quite gentle, really, but people
avoid them because they're a bit...</font>

459
00:43:27,289 --> 00:43:28,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Different.</font>

460
00:43:32,043 --> 00:43:34,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">But why can't the others see them?</font>

461
00:43:34,588 --> 00:43:38,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">They can only be seen
by people who've seen death.</font>

462
00:43:40,219 --> 00:43:42,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you've known someone
who's died, then?</font>

463
00:43:43,012 --> 00:43:44,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">My mum.</font>

464
00:43:45,181 --> 00:43:50,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was quite an extraordinary witch,
but she did like to experiment...</font>

465
00:43:50,271 --> 00:43:53,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">and one day,
one of her spells went badly wrong.</font>

466
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:56,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I was 9.
- I'm sorry.</font>

467
00:43:56,693 --> 00:43:58,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, it was rather horrible.</font>

468
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:04,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do feel very sad about it sometimes,
but I've got Dad.</font>

469
00:44:06,621 --> 00:44:09,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">We both believe you, by the way.</font>

470
00:44:12,335 --> 00:44:15,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">That He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
is back, and you fought him...</font>

471
00:44:15,505 --> 00:44:18,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the Ministry and the Prophet
are conspiring against you.</font>

472
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:23,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks. It seems you're about
the only ones that do.</font>

473
00:44:23,304 --> 00:44:24,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think that's true.</font>

474
00:44:27,016 --> 00:44:30,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I suppose
that's how he wants you to feel.</font>

475
00:44:30,311 --> 00:44:32,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you mean?</font>

476
00:44:32,731 --> 00:44:34,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, if I were You-Know-Who...</font>

477
00:44:35,065 --> 00:44:38,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd want you to feel cut off
from everyone else...</font>

478
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:41,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">because if it's just you alone...</font>

479
00:44:42,364 --> 00:44:44,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're not as much of a threat.</font>

480
00:45:02,344 --> 00:45:07,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do you ever stop eating?
- What? I'm hungry.</font>

481
00:45:10,476 --> 00:45:11,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry.</font>

482
00:45:13,355 --> 00:45:14,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I join you?</font>

483
00:45:16,525 --> 00:45:19,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pardon me, professor,
but what exactly are you insinuating?</font>

484
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:22,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am merely requesting
that when it comes to my students...</font>

485
00:45:22,739 --> 00:45:27,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">you conform to the prescribed
disciplinary practices.</font>

486
00:45:27,202 --> 00:45:28,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">So silly of me, but it sounds...</font>

487
00:45:29,036 --> 00:45:33,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">as if you're questioning my authority
in my own classroom...</font>

488
00:45:33,333 --> 00:45:34,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Minerva.</font>

489
00:45:34,835 --> 00:45:39,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not at all, Dolores,
merely your medieval methods.</font>

490
00:45:39,547 --> 00:45:42,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am sorry, dear.</font>

491
00:45:42,217 --> 00:45:45,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">But to question my practices
is to question the Ministry...</font>

492
00:45:45,719 --> 00:45:48,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">and by extension,
the minister himself.</font>

493
00:45:49,014 --> 00:45:50,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am a tolerant woman...</font>

494
00:45:50,766 --> 00:45:55,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">but the one thing
I will not stand for is disloyalty.</font>

495
00:45:57,606 --> 00:45:59,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Disloyalty.</font>

496
00:46:01,110 --> 00:46:05,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">Things at Hogwarts
are far worse than I feared.</font>

497
00:46:05,239 --> 00:46:08,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cornelius will want
to take immediate action.</font>

498
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:22,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's happened to Dumbledore?</font>

499
00:46:22,215 --> 00:46:24,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Having already revolutionized...</font>

500
00:46:24,925 --> 00:46:27,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">the teaching
of Defense Against the Dark Arts...</font>

501
00:46:29,264 --> 00:46:32,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dolores Umbridge will,
as high inquisitor, have powers...</font>

502
00:46:35,269 --> 00:46:39,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">to address the seriously falling
standards at Hogwarts School.</font>

503
00:46:47,199 --> 00:46:49,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just one question, dear.</font>

504
00:46:49,534 --> 00:46:53,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've been in this post
how long, exactly?</font>

505
00:47:00,545 --> 00:47:05,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">You applied first for the Defense Against
the Dark Arts post, is that correct?</font>

506
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

507
00:47:08,219 --> 00:47:10,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you were unsuccessful?</font>

508
00:47:12,056 --> 00:47:14,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">Obviously.</font>

509
00:47:46,842 --> 00:47:50,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could you please predict something
for me?</font>

510
00:47:52,012 --> 00:47:53,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry?</font>

511
00:47:58,436 --> 00:48:00,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">Move those mouths.</font>

512
00:48:06,777 --> 00:48:09,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">One teensy little prophecy?</font>

513
00:48:15,744 --> 00:48:17,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pity.</font>

514
00:48:17,746 --> 00:48:20,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, wait. Wait, no.
I think I do see something.</font>

515
00:48:20,333 --> 00:48:22,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I do. Something dark.</font>

516
00:48:22,793 --> 00:48:27,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are in grave danger.</font>

517
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lovely.</font>

518
00:48:40,728 --> 00:48:42,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cho. What's going on?</font>

519
00:48:43,063 --> 00:48:45,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Professor Trelawney.</font>

520
00:49:15,222 --> 00:49:18,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sixteen years I've lived
and taught here.</font>

521
00:49:18,893 --> 00:49:21,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hogwarts is my home.</font>

522
00:49:23,731 --> 00:49:25,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't do this.</font>

523
00:49:27,068 --> 00:49:29,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, I can.</font>

524
00:49:38,204 --> 00:49:39,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something you'd like to say?</font>

525
00:49:39,746 --> 00:49:42,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, there are several things
I would like to say.</font>

526
00:49:42,958 --> 00:49:44,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">There...</font>

527
00:49:58,474 --> 00:50:03,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor McGonagall, might I ask you
to escort Sybil back inside?</font>

528
00:50:04,438 --> 00:50:06,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sybil, dear. This way.</font>

529
00:50:07,065 --> 00:50:08,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

530
00:50:09,735 --> 00:50:13,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dumbledore, may I remind you
that under the terms...</font>

531
00:50:13,947 --> 00:50:17,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">of Educational Decree Number 23,
as enacted by the minister...</font>

532
00:50:17,367 --> 00:50:20,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have the right
to dismiss my teachers.</font>

533
00:50:20,704 --> 00:50:24,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">You do not, however, have the authority
to banish them from the grounds.</font>

534
00:50:24,458 --> 00:50:27,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">That power remains
with the headmaster.</font>

535
00:50:29,505 --> 00:50:30,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">For now.</font>

536
00:50:37,179 --> 00:50:39,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you all have studying to do?</font>

537
00:50:39,347 --> 00:50:40,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor.</font>

538
00:50:42,351 --> 00:50:43,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor?</font>

539
00:50:43,936 --> 00:50:46,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Dumbledore. Professor!</font>

540
00:50:46,898 --> 00:50:49,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Dumbledore.</font>

541
00:50:59,702 --> 00:51:01,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">That foul, evil, old gargoyle.</font>

542
00:51:02,371 --> 00:51:04,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not learning
how to defend ourselves.</font>

543
00:51:04,706 --> 00:51:07,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not learning
how to pass our OWLs.</font>

544
00:51:07,751 --> 00:51:09,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's taking over the entire school.</font>

545
00:51:09,961 --> 00:51:14,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Security has been and will remain
the Ministry's top priority.</font>

546
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">Furthermore,
we have convincing evidence...</font>

547
00:51:17,804 --> 00:51:20,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">that these disappearances
are the work...</font>

548
00:51:20,847 --> 00:51:24,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">of notorious
mass murderer Sirius Black.</font>

549
00:51:24,976 --> 00:51:26,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry.</font>

550
00:51:26,771 --> 00:51:28,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sirius.</font>

551
00:51:29,231 --> 00:51:31,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What are you doing here?
- Answering your letter.</font>

552
00:51:32,068 --> 00:51:34,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said you were worried
about Umbridge. What's she doing?</font>

553
00:51:35,153 --> 00:51:37,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">Training you to kill half-breeds?</font>

554
00:51:37,239 --> 00:51:40,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">- She's not letting us use magic at all.
- Well, I'm not surprised.</font>

555
00:51:40,576 --> 00:51:44,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">The latest intelligence is that Fudge
doesn't want you trained in combat.</font>

556
00:51:44,789 --> 00:51:45,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">Combat?</font>

557
00:51:46,331 --> 00:51:49,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">What does he think,
we're forming some sort of wizard army?</font>

558
00:51:49,418 --> 00:51:50,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's exactly what he thinks.</font>

559
00:51:50,961 --> 00:51:54,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">That Dumbledore is assembling
his own forces to take on the Ministry.</font>

560
00:51:55,423 --> 00:51:58,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's becoming more paranoid
by the minute.</font>

561
00:51:59,094 --> 00:52:02,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">The others wouldn't want me
telling you this, Harry...</font>

562
00:52:03,099 --> 00:52:05,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">but things aren't going at all well
with the Order.</font>

563
00:52:06,101 --> 00:52:08,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fudge is blocking the truth
at every turn...</font>

564
00:52:08,938 --> 00:52:12,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">and these disappearances
are just how it started before.</font>

565
00:52:13,733 --> 00:52:17,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Voldemort is on the move.</font>

566
00:52:17,447 --> 00:52:18,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, what can we do?</font>

567
00:52:19,449 --> 00:52:20,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone's coming.</font>

568
00:52:21,074 --> 00:52:23,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry I can't be of more help.</font>

569
00:52:23,452 --> 00:52:28,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">But for now, at least,
it looks like you're on your own.</font>

570
00:52:39,969 --> 00:52:42,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">He really is out there, isn't he?</font>

571
00:52:44,139 --> 00:52:46,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've got to be able
to defend ourselves.</font>

572
00:52:47,393 --> 00:52:51,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if Umbridge refuses to teach us
how, we need someone who will.</font>

573
00:53:08,164 --> 00:53:10,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry.</font>

574
00:53:19,925 --> 00:53:22,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is mad.
Who'd wanna be taught by me?</font>

575
00:53:22,469 --> 00:53:23,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a nutter, remember?</font>

576
00:53:23,846 --> 00:53:28,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look on the bright side: You can't be
any worse than old toad face.</font>

577
00:53:28,601 --> 00:53:32,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thanks, Ron.
- I'm here for you, mate.</font>

578
00:53:32,563 --> 00:53:34,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's supposed to be meeting us, then?</font>

579
00:53:35,065 --> 00:53:37,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just a couple of people.</font>

580
00:53:42,197 --> 00:53:43,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lovely spot.</font>

581
00:53:47,369 --> 00:53:49,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thought it would be safer
off the beaten track.</font>

582
00:53:49,664 --> 00:53:51,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">Matey, come back here.</font>

583
00:54:00,257 --> 00:54:01,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi.</font>

584
00:54:01,842 --> 00:54:04,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you all know why we're here.</font>

585
00:54:04,887 --> 00:54:06,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need a teacher.</font>

586
00:54:07,849 --> 00:54:10,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">A proper teacher.</font>

587
00:54:10,309 --> 00:54:13,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">One who's had experience defending
themselves against the Dark Arts.</font>

588
00:54:13,646 --> 00:54:15,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why?
- Why?</font>

589
00:54:15,565 --> 00:54:17,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because You-Know-Who's back,
you tosspot.</font>

590
00:54:17,818 --> 00:54:19,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So he says.
- So Dumbledore says.</font>

591
00:54:19,570 --> 00:54:21,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">So Dumbledore says because he says.</font>

592
00:54:21,864 --> 00:54:24,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">The point is, where's the proof?</font>

593
00:54:25,617 --> 00:54:28,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">If Potter could tell us more
about how Diggory got killed...</font>

594
00:54:31,748 --> 00:54:35,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not gonna talk about Cedric, so if
that's why you're here, clear out now.</font>

595
00:54:35,710 --> 00:54:39,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, Hermione. They're here
because they think I'm some freak.</font>

596
00:54:39,297 --> 00:54:41,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it true you can produce
a Patronus Charm?</font>

597
00:54:45,262 --> 00:54:46,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

598
00:54:48,139 --> 00:54:49,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've seen it.</font>

599
00:54:49,766 --> 00:54:51,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blimey, Harry.
I didn't know you could do that.</font>

600
00:54:52,561 --> 00:54:56,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he killed a basilisk, with the sword
in Dumbledore's office.</font>

601
00:54:56,856 --> 00:54:58,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's true.</font>

602
00:54:58,275 --> 00:55:01,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">Third year, he fought off
about a hundred Dementors at once.</font>

603
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:05,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">Last year, he really did fight off
You-Know-Who in the flesh.</font>

604
00:55:05,282 --> 00:55:06,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait.</font>

605
00:55:07,284 --> 00:55:11,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, it all sounds great
when you say it like that...</font>

606
00:55:11,996 --> 00:55:15,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">but the truth is,
most of that was just luck.</font>

607
00:55:15,833 --> 00:55:19,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't know what I was doing
half the time. I nearly always had help.</font>

608
00:55:19,755 --> 00:55:23,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He's just being modest.
- No, Hermione, I'm not.</font>

609
00:55:25,802 --> 00:55:30,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">Facing this stuff in real life
is not like school.</font>

610
00:55:31,516 --> 00:55:34,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">In school, if you make a mistake,
you can just try again tomorrow.</font>

611
00:55:35,144 --> 00:55:36,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">But out there...</font>

612
00:55:37,231 --> 00:55:40,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">when you're a second away
from being murdered...</font>

613
00:55:40,692 --> 00:55:44,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">or watching a friend die
right before your eyes...</font>

614
00:55:47,157 --> 00:55:48,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't know what that's like.</font>

615
00:55:58,751 --> 00:56:00,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're right, Harry, we don't.</font>

616
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:03,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why we need your help.</font>

617
00:56:03,673 --> 00:56:06,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because if we're going to have
any chance at beating...</font>

618
00:56:08,804 --> 00:56:09,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">Voldemort...</font>

619
00:56:13,391 --> 00:56:15,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's really back.</font>

620
00:56:37,541 --> 00:56:39,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right. First we need to find
a place to practice...</font>

621
00:56:39,293 --> 00:56:40,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">where Umbridge won't find out.</font>

622
00:56:40,878 --> 00:56:43,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The Shrieking Shack.
- It's too small.</font>

623
00:56:43,213 --> 00:56:46,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Forbidden Forest?
- Not bloody likely.</font>

624
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:48,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry, what happens
if Umbridge does find out?</font>

625
00:56:48,594 --> 00:56:49,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who cares?</font>

626
00:56:50,387 --> 00:56:55,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, it's sort of exciting, isn't it,
breaking the rules?</font>

627
00:56:55,391 --> 00:56:57,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are you and what have you done
with Hermione?</font>

628
00:56:58,394 --> 00:57:02,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyway, at least we know
one positive thing that came from today.</font>

629
00:57:02,231 --> 00:57:03,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's that?</font>

630
00:57:05,235 --> 00:57:07,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cho couldn't take her eyes off you,
could she?</font>

631
00:57:10,657 --> 00:57:13,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right. Over the next few days,
we should each come up...</font>

632
00:57:13,911 --> 00:57:16,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">with a couple of possibilities
of places we can practice.</font>

633
00:57:16,914 --> 00:57:20,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've got to make sure, wherever it is,
there's no chance she can find us.</font>

634
00:57:20,918 --> 00:57:22,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will do, Harry.</font>

635
00:57:31,469 --> 00:57:35,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">All student organizations
are henceforth disbanded.</font>

636
00:57:35,766 --> 00:57:39,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any student in noncompliance
will be expelled.</font>

637
00:57:39,603 --> 00:57:42,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">Watch where you're going,
Longbottom.</font>

638
00:58:17,766 --> 00:58:22,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've done it, Neville.
You found the Room of Requirement.</font>

639
00:58:22,186 --> 00:58:23,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">The what?</font>

640
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:25,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's also known as
the Come and Go Room.</font>

641
00:58:26,065 --> 00:58:29,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Room of Requirement only appears
when a person has real need of it.</font>

642
00:58:29,652 --> 00:58:32,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it's always equipped
for the seeker's needs.</font>

643
00:58:32,489 --> 00:58:36,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">So say you really needed the toilet...</font>

644
00:58:37,411 --> 00:58:42,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">Charming, Ronald.
But, yes, that is the general idea.</font>

645
00:58:42,416 --> 00:58:47,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's brilliant. It's like Hogwarts
wants us to fight back.</font>

646
00:58:58,347 --> 00:58:59,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Expelliarmus.</font>

647
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:06,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm hopeless.</font>

648
00:59:06,523 --> 00:59:10,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're just flourishing your wand
too much. Try it like this. Expelliarmus.</font>

649
00:59:13,697 --> 00:59:17,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will please copy
the approved text four times...</font>

650
00:59:17,867 --> 00:59:20,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">to ensure maximum retention.</font>

651
00:59:21,246 --> 00:59:24,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">- There will be no need to talk.
- No need to think's more like it.</font>

652
00:59:25,126 --> 00:59:27,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Expelliarmus.
- Wands away.</font>

653
00:59:40,099 --> 00:59:43,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stunning is one of the most useful spells
in your arsenal.</font>

654
00:59:43,353 --> 00:59:45,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a wizard's bread and butter, really.</font>

655
00:59:45,730 --> 00:59:49,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">So come on, then, Nigel.
Give it your best shot.</font>

656
00:59:55,824 --> 00:59:57,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stupefy!</font>

657
01:00:02,121 --> 01:00:06,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good. Not bad at all, Nigel. Well done.</font>

658
01:00:11,922 --> 01:00:14,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry. I'll go easy on you.</font>

659
01:00:14,425 --> 01:00:16,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks, Ronald.</font>

660
01:00:19,097 --> 01:00:21,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Come on, Ron.
- Come on, Ron.</font>

661
01:00:21,431 --> 01:00:24,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You can do it.
- Come on, Ron.</font>

662
01:00:24,853 --> 01:00:26,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">- One Sickle.
- You're on.</font>

663
01:00:33,945 --> 01:00:35,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stupefy.</font>

664
01:00:40,952 --> 01:00:42,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thank you.
- Shut up.</font>

665
01:00:43,329 --> 01:00:47,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">I let her do that.
It's good manners, isn't it?</font>

666
01:00:50,170 --> 01:00:52,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was completely intentional.</font>

667
01:01:18,322 --> 01:01:21,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">Up you come.
Would you like a cup of tea?</font>

668
01:01:23,577 --> 01:01:27,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, focus on a fixed point
and try again.</font>

669
01:01:28,123 --> 01:01:30,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">Expelliarmus.</font>

670
01:01:31,668 --> 01:01:34,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very good. Keep your concentration.</font>

671
01:01:36,340 --> 01:01:37,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great.</font>

672
01:01:39,092 --> 01:01:40,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">A little higher.</font>

673
01:01:49,186 --> 01:01:52,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm okay. I'm okay.</font>

674
01:02:10,041 --> 01:02:12,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Stupefy.
- Stupefy.</font>

675
01:02:14,211 --> 01:02:17,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those wishing to join
the Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit...</font>

676
01:02:17,757 --> 01:02:20,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">may sign up
in the high inquisitor's office.</font>

678
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:32,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">Working hard is important, but there's
something that matters even more:</font>

679
01:02:32,813 --> 01:02:35,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">Believing in yourself.</font>

680
01:02:35,190 --> 01:02:37,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Expelliarmus.
- Levicorpus. Got it.</font>

681
01:02:37,485 --> 01:02:39,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Think of it this way.</font>

682
01:02:39,237 --> 01:02:43,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every great wizard in history
has started out...</font>

683
01:02:43,574 --> 01:02:47,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">as nothing more
than what we are now: Students.</font>

684
01:02:47,619 --> 01:02:50,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">If they can do it, why not us?</font>

685
01:03:00,717 --> 01:03:02,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Stupefy.

689
01:03:30,621 --> 01:03:33,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Expelliarmus.

<font color="#FFFFFF">Expelliarmus.</font>

692
01:03:45,969 --> 01:03:49,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fantastic, Neville. Well done, man.</font>

693
01:03:50,974 --> 01:03:53,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">So that's it for this lesson.</font>

694
01:03:53,311 --> 01:03:56,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, we're not gonna be meeting again
until after the holidays.</font>

695
01:03:57,106 --> 01:04:00,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">So just keep practicing on your own
as best you can.</font>

696
01:04:00,318 --> 01:04:03,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">And well done, everyone.
Great, great work.</font>

697
01:04:08,492 --> 01:04:09,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well done, mate.</font>

698
01:04:10,077 --> 01:04:11,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks.</font>

699
01:04:17,168 --> 01:04:19,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">See you after Christmas.</font>

700
01:04:29,014 --> 01:04:31,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">See you in the Common Room, Harry.</font>

701
01:04:32,476 --> 01:04:35,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thanks a lot, Harry.
- No worries.</font>

702
01:04:36,938 --> 01:04:39,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thank you so much.
- Not at all. Merry Christmas.</font>

703
01:04:39,775 --> 01:04:42,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thank you, Harry.
- Thank you. Merry Christmas.</font>

704
01:04:42,318 --> 01:04:44,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Merry Christmas.
- Have a good Christmas.</font>

705
01:04:44,362 --> 01:04:46,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Have a great Christmas, Luna.
- We've been thinking.</font>

706
01:04:47,115 --> 01:04:49,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">We could always slip Umbridge
some Puking Pastilles.</font>

707
01:04:49,702 --> 01:04:52,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or Fever Fudge. They give you
massive, pus-filled boils...</font>

708
01:04:52,538 --> 01:04:55,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sounds great, guys.
Would you excuse me?</font>

709
01:05:06,010 --> 01:05:10,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you all right? I heard Umbridge
gave you a rough time the other day.</font>

710
01:05:10,889 --> 01:05:13,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. I'm okay.</font>

711
01:05:13,976 --> 01:05:16,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyway, it's worth it.</font>

712
01:05:22,108 --> 01:05:25,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just, learning all this...</font>

713
01:05:26,070 --> 01:05:29,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">makes me wonder whether,
if he'd known it...</font>

714
01:05:29,699 --> 01:05:32,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cedric did know this stuff.</font>

715
01:05:32,994 --> 01:05:35,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was really good.</font>

716
01:05:36,039 --> 01:05:38,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just, Voldemort was better.</font>

717
01:05:43,297 --> 01:05:45,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a really good teacher, Harry.</font>

718
01:05:46,382 --> 01:05:49,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never been able
to stun anything before.</font>

719
01:05:58,436 --> 01:06:00,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mistletoe.</font>

720
01:06:03,608 --> 01:06:05,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">Probably full of Nargles, though.</font>

721
01:06:06,612 --> 01:06:08,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are Nargles?</font>

722
01:06:08,989 --> 01:06:10,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">No idea.</font>

723
01:06:32,762 --> 01:06:34,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, how was it?</font>

724
01:06:35,724 --> 01:06:37,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wet.</font>

725
01:06:37,893 --> 01:06:39,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, she was sort of crying.</font>

726
01:06:40,019 --> 01:06:41,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">That bad at it, are you?</font>

727
01:06:42,148 --> 01:06:44,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure Harry's kissing
was more than satisfactory.</font>

728
01:06:47,735 --> 01:06:49,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cho spends half her time
crying these days.</font>

729
01:06:50,072 --> 01:06:52,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'd think a bit of snogging
would cheer her up.</font>

730
01:06:53,826 --> 01:06:56,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you understand
how she must be feeling?</font>

731
01:07:01,083 --> 01:07:04,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, obviously
she's feeling sad about Cedric...</font>

732
01:07:04,711 --> 01:07:07,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">and confused about liking Harry
and guilty about kissing him...</font>

733
01:07:07,965 --> 01:07:11,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">conflicted because Umbridge might
sack her mum from the Ministry...</font>

734
01:07:11,342 --> 01:07:15,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">and frightened of failing her OWLs
because she's worrying about everything.</font>

735
01:07:17,016 --> 01:07:20,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">One person couldn't feel all that.
They'd explode.</font>

736
01:07:20,768 --> 01:07:24,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just because you've got
the emotional range of a teaspoon...</font>

737
01:07:39,996 --> 01:07:41,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry.</font>

738
01:07:50,298 --> 01:07:53,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">Voldemort may be after something.</font>

739
01:07:54,052 --> 01:07:57,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something he didn't have last time.</font>

740
01:07:57,889 --> 01:07:59,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry.</font>

741
01:08:00,768 --> 01:08:02,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry.</font>

742
01:08:33,134 --> 01:08:36,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the dream,
were you standing next to the victim...</font>

743
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:38,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">or looking down at the scene?</font>

744
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:41,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Neither. It was like I...</font>

745
01:08:42,225 --> 01:08:44,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you please just tell me
what's happening?</font>

746
01:08:44,478 --> 01:08:46,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everard, Arthur's on guard duty
tonight.</font>

747
01:08:46,980 --> 01:08:49,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make sure he's found
by the right people.</font>

748
01:08:49,567 --> 01:08:51,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sir.
- Phineas.</font>

749
01:08:51,318 --> 01:08:53,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must go to your portrait
at Grimmauld Place.</font>

750
01:08:53,779 --> 01:08:56,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell them that Arthur Weasley
is gravely injured...</font>

751
01:08:56,573 --> 01:09:00,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">and his children will be arriving there
soon by Portkey.</font>

752
01:09:00,911 --> 01:09:03,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">They've got him, Albus. It was close,
but they think he'll make it.</font>

753
01:09:04,164 --> 01:09:06,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's more,
the Dark Lord failed to acquire it.</font>

754
01:09:06,833 --> 01:09:08,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, thank goodness. Next we need to...</font>

755
01:09:08,918 --> 01:09:10,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at me!</font>

756
01:09:16,635 --> 01:09:18,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's happening to me?</font>

757
01:09:26,729 --> 01:09:28,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wished to see me, headmaster?</font>

758
01:09:28,774 --> 01:09:33,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Severus. I'm afraid we can't wait.
Not even till the morning.</font>

759
01:09:34,069 --> 01:09:36,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Otherwise, we'll all be vulnerable.</font>

760
01:09:41,744 --> 01:09:43,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">It appears there's a connection...</font>

761
01:09:43,537 --> 01:09:45,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">between the Dark Lord's mind
and your own.</font>

762
01:09:46,041 --> 01:09:50,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whether he is, as yet, aware of this
connection is, for the moment, unclear.</font>

763
01:09:50,545 --> 01:09:53,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pray he remains ignorant.</font>

764
01:09:53,756 --> 01:09:57,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">You mean, if he knows about it, then...</font>

765
01:09:57,511 --> 01:10:01,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">he'll be able to read my mind?
- Read it, control it...</font>

766
01:10:02,056 --> 01:10:03,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">unhinge it.</font>

767
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:07,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the past, it was often
the Dark Lord's pleasure...</font>

768
01:10:07,645 --> 01:10:09,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">to invade the minds of his victims...</font>

769
01:10:10,064 --> 01:10:13,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">creating visions designed
to torture them into madness.</font>

770
01:10:14,778 --> 01:10:19,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only after extracting the last exquisite
ounce of agony...</font>

771
01:10:19,740 --> 01:10:24,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">only when he had them literally
begging for death, would he finally...</font>

772
01:10:24,203 --> 01:10:25,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">kill them.</font>

773
01:10:26,413 --> 01:10:28,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">Used properly,
the power of Occlumency...</font>

774
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:32,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">will help shield you
from access or influence.</font>

775
01:10:32,671 --> 01:10:37,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">In these lessons, I will attempt
to penetrate your mind.</font>

776
01:10:38,009 --> 01:10:41,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will attempt to resist.</font>

777
01:10:41,387 --> 01:10:42,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">Prepare yourself.</font>

778
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:46,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">Legilimens.</font>

779
01:10:54,943 --> 01:10:58,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Concentrate, Potter. Focus.</font>

780
01:11:24,430 --> 01:11:26,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas.</font>

781
01:11:27,266 --> 01:11:29,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here we go.</font>

782
01:11:30,103 --> 01:11:32,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">Daddy's back.</font>

783
01:11:35,442 --> 01:11:39,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sit down, everybody, sit down.
That's it. Now, presents.</font>

784
01:11:39,237 --> 01:11:43,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And a nice big box for Ron.
- Big box for you. And...</font>

785
01:11:46,411 --> 01:11:48,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fred and George. Come on, open up.</font>

786
01:11:48,788 --> 01:11:51,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I want to see your faces.
- Yes.</font>

787
01:11:51,248 --> 01:11:53,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Try it on.
- Thanks, Mum. It's perfect.</font>

788
01:11:53,835 --> 01:11:58,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Just what he wanted, actually.
- Yeah. Right. Thanks, Mum.</font>

789
01:11:58,297 --> 01:12:01,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, then, everybody.
Let's clear this away.</font>

790
01:12:01,342 --> 01:12:03,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Harry, Harry.</font>

791
01:12:03,511 --> 01:12:05,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">There you are.</font>

792
01:12:06,430 --> 01:12:08,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Happy Christmas.
- Thank you.</font>

793
01:12:08,850 --> 01:12:10,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Lovely to have you with us.
- Thank you.</font>

794
01:12:10,851 --> 01:12:12,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, Daddy. Pass that to Daddy.</font>

795
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:14,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thank you.
- Has everybody got?</font>

796
01:12:14,898 --> 01:12:16,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fred? George?</font>

797
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:18,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hermione.
- A Christmas toast.</font>

798
01:12:19,152 --> 01:12:21,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">To Mr. Harry Potter...</font>

799
01:12:22,029 --> 01:12:24,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">without whom I would not be here.</font>

800
01:12:28,453 --> 01:12:30,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Harry.
- Harry.</font>

801
01:12:30,956 --> 01:12:32,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry.</font>

802
01:12:33,207 --> 01:12:35,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is delicious.
I shall be needing some more of that.</font>

803
01:12:35,961 --> 01:12:38,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">Daddy, don't forget last Christmas.</font>

804
01:12:39,256 --> 01:12:42,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't understand
why you don't want to wear it, Ronald.</font>

805
01:12:43,467 --> 01:12:45,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">I look like a bloody idiot, that's why.</font>

806
01:12:45,470 --> 01:12:47,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">No more than usual, Ron.</font>

807
01:12:47,514 --> 01:12:49,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know why...</font>

808
01:12:55,354 --> 01:12:59,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nasty brat, standing there
as bold as brass.</font>

809
01:13:00,109 --> 01:13:04,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry Potter,
the boy who stopped the Dark Lord.</font>

810
01:13:05,030 --> 01:13:08,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">Friend of Mudbloods
and blood-traitors alike.</font>

811
01:13:08,452 --> 01:13:11,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">- If my poor mistress only knew...
- Kreacher!</font>

812
01:13:11,246 --> 01:13:14,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's enough of your bile.
Away with you!</font>

813
01:13:14,248 --> 01:13:16,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course, master.</font>

814
01:13:16,417 --> 01:13:21,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kreacher lives to serve
the noble house of Black.</font>

815
01:13:23,425 --> 01:13:25,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry about that.</font>

816
01:13:25,886 --> 01:13:29,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">He never was very pleasant,
even when I was a boy.</font>

817
01:13:29,890 --> 01:13:31,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not to me, anyway.</font>

818
01:13:32,809 --> 01:13:34,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, you grew up here?</font>

819
01:13:34,935 --> 01:13:37,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is my parents' house.</font>

820
01:13:37,521 --> 01:13:41,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">I offered it to Dumbledore
as headquarters for the Order.</font>

821
01:13:42,485 --> 01:13:45,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">About the only useful thing
I've been able to do.</font>

822
01:13:47,157 --> 01:13:49,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the Black family tree.</font>

823
01:13:50,452 --> 01:13:52,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">My deranged cousin.</font>

824
01:13:52,746 --> 01:13:55,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hated the lot of them.</font>

825
01:13:55,623 --> 01:14:00,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">My parents with their pure-blood mania.</font>

826
01:14:03,547 --> 01:14:07,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">My mother did that after I ran away.</font>

827
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:11,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">Charming woman.</font>

828
01:14:12,807 --> 01:14:14,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was 16.</font>

829
01:14:15,310 --> 01:14:16,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where did you go?</font>

830
01:14:18,814 --> 01:14:20,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">Round your dad's.</font>

831
01:14:21,565 --> 01:14:24,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was always welcome at the Potters'.</font>

832
01:14:24,985 --> 01:14:27,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see him so much in you, Harry.</font>

833
01:14:28,364 --> 01:14:30,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are so very much alike.</font>

834
01:14:31,493 --> 01:14:33,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not so sure.</font>

835
01:14:34,538 --> 01:14:35,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sirius, when I was...</font>

836
01:14:38,835 --> 01:14:43,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I saw Mr. Weasley attacked,
I wasn't just watching.</font>

837
01:14:44,506 --> 01:14:46,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was the snake.</font>

838
01:14:46,842 --> 01:14:49,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">And afterwards,
in Dumbledore's office...</font>

839
01:14:49,970 --> 01:14:54,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">there was a moment
when I wanted to...</font>

840
01:14:59,313 --> 01:15:02,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">This connection
between me and Voldemort.</font>

841
01:15:02,859 --> 01:15:06,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if the reason for it
is that I am becoming more like him?</font>

842
01:15:07,779 --> 01:15:12,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just feel so angry all the time.</font>

843
01:15:12,868 --> 01:15:17,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what if, after everything
that I've been through...</font>

844
01:15:17,582 --> 01:15:21,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">something's gone wrong inside me?
What if I'm becoming bad?</font>

845
01:15:23,796 --> 01:15:27,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to listen to me
very carefully, Harry.</font>

846
01:15:28,216 --> 01:15:31,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not a bad person.</font>

847
01:15:32,054 --> 01:15:36,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a very good person
who bad things have happened to.</font>

848
01:15:37,018 --> 01:15:38,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">You understand?</font>

849
01:15:40,229 --> 01:15:45,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Besides, the world isn't split
into good people and Death Eaters.</font>

850
01:15:45,443 --> 01:15:49,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've all got both light and dark
inside of us.</font>

851
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:53,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">What matters
is the part we choose to act on.</font>

852
01:15:55,869 --> 01:15:58,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's who we really are.</font>

853
01:16:01,917 --> 01:16:03,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry, time to go.</font>

854
01:16:05,421 --> 01:16:09,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">When all this is over,
we'll be a proper family.</font>

855
01:16:09,884 --> 01:16:11,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll see.</font>

856
01:16:12,595 --> 01:16:13,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

857
01:16:51,425 --> 01:16:52,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really?</font>

858
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:55,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry. Harry.</font>

859
01:16:55,555 --> 01:16:57,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hagrid's back.</font>

860
01:17:00,434 --> 01:17:02,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

861
01:17:16,492 --> 01:17:19,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will say this one last time.</font>

862
01:17:19,953 --> 01:17:22,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm ordering you to tell me
where you've been.</font>

863
01:17:22,497 --> 01:17:25,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you. I've been away
for me health.</font>

864
01:17:25,835 --> 01:17:30,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Your health?
- Yeah. Bit of fresh air, you know.</font>

865
01:17:30,172 --> 01:17:35,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yes. As gamekeeper,
fresh air must be difficult to come by.</font>

866
01:17:37,054 --> 01:17:39,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I were you,
I shouldn't get too used to being back.</font>

867
01:17:39,724 --> 01:17:43,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">In fact, I mightn't bother
unpacking at all.</font>

868
01:18:01,953 --> 01:18:05,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is top-secret, right?</font>

869
01:18:05,957 --> 01:18:08,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dumbledore sent me
to parley with the giants.</font>

870
01:18:08,502 --> 01:18:10,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">Giants?</font>

871
01:18:11,213 --> 01:18:12,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">You found them?</font>

872
01:18:12,422 --> 01:18:16,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, they're not that hard to find, to be
perfectly honest. They're so big, see?</font>

873
01:18:17,177 --> 01:18:20,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">I tried to convince them
to join the cause.</font>

874
01:18:20,389 --> 01:18:23,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I wasn't the only one
that was trying to win them over.</font>

875
01:18:23,768 --> 01:18:25,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Death Eaters?
- Yes.</font>

876
01:18:26,145 --> 01:18:29,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">Trying to persuade them
to join You-Know-Who.</font>

877
01:18:29,981 --> 01:18:32,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Did they?
- I gave them Dumbledore's message.</font>

01:18:32,527 --> 01:18:36,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">Suppose some of them remember
he was friendly to them. I suppose.</font>

879
01:18:40,243 --> 01:18:41,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">And they did this to you?</font>

880
01:18:42,244 --> 01:18:43,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not exactly, no.</font>

881
01:18:44,497 --> 01:18:48,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, go on, you have it, then,
you dozy dog.</font>

882
01:19:02,390 --> 01:19:04,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's changing out there.</font>

883
01:19:04,934 --> 01:19:06,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just like last time.</font>

884
01:19:07,979 --> 01:19:09,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a storm coming, Harry.</font>

885
01:19:10,355 --> 01:19:13,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'd all best be ready when she does.</font>

886
01:19:50,439 --> 01:19:53,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have confirmed
that 10 high-security prisoners...</font>

887
01:19:53,649 --> 01:19:56,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the early hours of yesterday evening
did escape.</font>

888
01:19:56,653 --> 01:20:00,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">And of course, the Muggle prime minister
has been alerted to the danger.</font>

889
01:20:00,490 --> 01:20:02,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">We strongly suspect...</font>

890
01:20:03,409 --> 01:20:05,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">that the breakout was engineered...</font>

891
01:20:05,578 --> 01:20:09,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">by a man with personal experience
in escaping from Azkaban...</font>

892
01:20:09,957 --> 01:20:14,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">notorious mass murderer Sirius Black...</font>

893
01:20:15,631 --> 01:20:20,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">cousin of escapee
Bellatrix Lestrange.</font>

894
01:20:30,311 --> 01:20:32,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dumbledore warned Fudge
this could happen.</font>

895
01:20:32,773 --> 01:20:35,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's gonna get us all killed
just because he can't face the truth.</font>

896
01:20:36,109 --> 01:20:37,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry.</font>

897
01:20:40,948 --> 01:20:42,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanted to apologize.</font>

898
01:20:43,533 --> 01:20:47,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now even me mum says the Prophet's
version of things don't add up.</font>

899
01:20:47,871 --> 01:20:53,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, what I'm really trying to say
is that I believe you.</font>

900
01:21:00,716 --> 01:21:02,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">Neville?</font>

901
01:21:14,898 --> 01:21:17,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fourteen years ago...</font>

902
01:21:17,234 --> 01:21:21,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">a Death Eater
named Bellatrix Lestrange...</font>

903
01:21:21,654 --> 01:21:24,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">used a Cruciatus Curse
on my parents.</font>

904
01:21:25,408 --> 01:21:29,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">She tortured them for information...</font>

905
01:21:29,579 --> 01:21:31,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">but they never gave in.</font>

906
01:21:33,417 --> 01:21:35,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm quite proud to be their son.</font>

907
01:21:36,878 --> 01:21:40,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I'm not sure I'm ready
for everyone to know just yet.</font>

908
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:50,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna make them proud, Neville.
That's a promise.</font>

909
01:21:55,063 --> 01:21:58,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make it a powerful memory,
the happiest you can remember.</font>

910
01:21:58,942 --> 01:22:02,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">Allow it to fill you up.
Keep trying, Seamus.</font>

911
01:22:02,529 --> 01:22:03,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">George, your turn now.</font>

912
01:22:05,282 --> 01:22:07,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">Expecto Patronum.</font>

913
01:22:08,534 --> 01:22:11,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">A full-bodied Patronus
is the most difficult to produce...</font>

914
01:22:12,122 --> 01:22:15,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">but shield forms can also be equally
useful against a variety of opponents.</font>

915
01:22:16,126 --> 01:22:17,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow, that was really good.</font>

916
01:22:18,086 --> 01:22:19,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fantastic, Ginny.</font>

917
01:22:19,796 --> 01:22:23,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just remember, your Patronus can only
protect you for as long as you stay focused.</font>

918
01:22:24,009 --> 01:22:26,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">So focus, Luna.</font>

919
01:22:30,015 --> 01:22:31,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Think of the happiest thing you can.</font>

920
01:22:31,891 --> 01:22:33,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">Expecto Patronum.</font>

921
01:22:34,019 --> 01:22:36,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm trying.
- I know. It's good.</font>

922
01:22:37,064 --> 01:22:41,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is really advanced stuff, guys.
You're doing so well.</font>

923
01:22:42,069 --> 01:22:44,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">Expecto Patronum.</font>

924
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:28,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll make short work of this.</font>

925
01:23:30,199 --> 01:23:32,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bombarda Maxima.</font>

926
01:23:50,470 --> 01:23:51,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get them.</font>

927
01:23:52,264 --> 01:23:53,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">Been watching them for weeks.</font>

928
01:23:53,890 --> 01:23:55,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">And see, "Dumbledore's Army"...</font>

929
01:23:56,268 --> 01:23:59,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">proof of what I've been telling you
right from the beginning, Cornelius.</font>

930
01:24:01,355 --> 01:24:03,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">All your fear-mongering
about You-Know-Who...</font>

931
01:24:03,567 --> 01:24:05,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">never fooled us for a minute.</font>

932
01:24:05,277 --> 01:24:07,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">We saw your lies for what they were:</font>

933
01:24:07,529 --> 01:24:11,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">A smokescreen for your bid
to seize control of the Ministry.</font>

934
01:24:11,492 --> 01:24:12,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">Naturally.</font>

935
01:24:12,701 --> 01:24:15,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, professor.
He had nothing to do with it. It was me.</font>

936
01:24:15,412 --> 01:24:19,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">Most noble of you, Harry, to shield me,
but as has been pointed out...</font>

937
01:24:19,248 --> 01:24:24,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">the parchment clearly says
"Dumbledore's Army," not "Potter's."</font>

938
01:24:24,253 --> 01:24:26,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">I instructed Harry
to form this organization.</font>

939
01:24:27,048 --> 01:24:30,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I, and I alone,
am responsible for its activities.</font>

940
01:24:30,676 --> 01:24:32,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dispatch an owl to the Daily Prophet.</font>

941
01:24:32,679 --> 01:24:35,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we hurry, we should still make
the morning edition.</font>

942
01:24:35,390 --> 01:24:40,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dawlish, Shacklebolt,
you will escort Dumbledore...</font>

943
01:24:40,354 --> 01:24:41,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">to Azkaban...</font>

944
01:24:43,024 --> 01:24:48,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">to await trial
for conspiracy and sedition.</font>

945
01:24:48,363 --> 01:24:51,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought we might hit this little snag.</font>

946
01:24:52,449 --> 01:24:55,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">You seem to be laboring
under the delusion that I'm going to...</font>

947
01:24:56,453 --> 01:24:57,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">What was the phrase?</font>

948
01:24:58,081 --> 01:24:59,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Come quietly.</font>

949
01:24:59,832 --> 01:25:01,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I can tell you this:</font>

950
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:04,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have no intention
of going to Azkaban.</font>

951
01:25:04,462 --> 01:25:05,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enough of this.</font>

952
01:25:06,213 --> 01:25:07,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take him.</font>

953
01:25:20,145 --> 01:25:24,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you may not like him, minister...</font>

954
01:25:24,690 --> 01:25:26,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you can't deny...</font>

955
01:25:27,359 --> 01:25:30,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dumbledore has got style.</font>

956
01:25:54,179 --> 01:25:58,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boys and girls are not permitted
to be within eight inches of each other.</font>

957
01:25:59,016 --> 01:26:02,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those wishing to join
the Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit...</font>

958
01:26:02,604 --> 01:26:07,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Students will be submitted to questioning
about suspected illicit activities.</font>

959
01:26:07,817 --> 01:26:12,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any student in noncompliance
will be expelled.</font>

960
01:27:23,309 --> 01:27:24,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry.</font>

961
01:27:31,859 --> 01:27:35,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">You did everything you could.
No one could win against that old hag.</font>

962
01:27:35,447 --> 01:27:37,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even Dumbledore
didn't see this coming.</font>

963
01:27:38,699 --> 01:27:40,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry, if it's anyone's fault, it's ours.</font>

964
01:27:41,034 --> 01:27:43,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, we talked you into it.</font>

965
01:27:43,287 --> 01:27:45,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but I agreed.</font>

966
01:27:45,832 --> 01:27:49,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">I tried so hard to help,
and all it's done is make things worse.</font>

967
01:27:52,005 --> 01:27:54,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyway, that doesn't matter anymore.</font>

968
01:27:55,507 --> 01:27:59,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I don't want to play anymore.
All it does is make you care too much.</font>

969
01:27:59,887 --> 01:28:02,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the more you care,
the more you have to lose.</font>

970
01:28:02,724 --> 01:28:05,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So maybe it's just better to...
- To what?</font>

971
01:28:08,145 --> 01:28:10,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">To go it alone.</font>

972
01:28:16,404 --> 01:28:18,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hagrid.</font>

973
01:28:21,826 --> 01:28:24,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any idea where he's taking us?</font>

974
01:28:24,412 --> 01:28:27,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hagrid, why can't you just tell us?</font>

975
01:28:35,798 --> 01:28:38,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never seen the centaurs so riled.</font>

976
01:28:38,635 --> 01:28:41,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">And they're dangerous
at the best of times.</font>

977
01:28:42,137 --> 01:28:44,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Ministry restricts
their territory much more...</font>

978
01:28:44,640 --> 01:28:46,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">they'll have a full uprising
on their hands.</font>

979
01:28:47,018 --> 01:28:48,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hagrid, what's going on?</font>

980
01:28:48,853 --> 01:28:51,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry to be so mysterious, you three.</font>

981
01:28:51,230 --> 01:28:56,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wouldn't be bothering you at all with it,
but with Dumbledore gone...</font>

982
01:28:56,860 --> 01:29:00,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll likely be getting the sack
any day now.</font>

983
01:29:00,198 --> 01:29:03,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I just couldn't leave
without telling someone about him.</font>

984
01:29:07,872 --> 01:29:09,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grawpy.</font>

985
01:29:11,917 --> 01:29:14,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">Down here, you great buffoon.</font>

986
01:29:20,385 --> 01:29:22,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grawpy.</font>

987
01:29:22,845 --> 01:29:24,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brought you some company.</font>

988
01:29:36,900 --> 01:29:39,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">I couldn't just leave him, because...</font>

989
01:29:39,319 --> 01:29:41,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because he's my brother.</font>

990
01:29:41,238 --> 01:29:42,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blimey.</font>

991
01:29:42,532 --> 01:29:44,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, half brother, really.</font>

992
01:29:44,742 --> 01:29:49,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's completely harmless, just like I said.
Little high-spirited, is all.</font>

993
01:29:52,126 --> 01:29:54,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Grawpy, that is not polite.
- Hagrid, do something.</font>

994
01:29:54,627 --> 01:29:57,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">We talked about this.
You do not grab, do you?</font>

995
01:29:57,213 --> 01:29:59,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's your new friend, Hermione.</font>

996
01:29:59,632 --> 01:30:00,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grawpy.</font>

997
01:30:05,264 --> 01:30:06,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grawp.</font>

998
01:30:08,475 --> 01:30:11,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put me down.</font>

999
01:30:15,231 --> 01:30:16,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now.</font>

1000
01:30:28,953 --> 01:30:30,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">You all right?</font>

1001
01:30:31,332 --> 01:30:33,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine.</font>

1002
01:30:33,417 --> 01:30:35,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just needs a firm hand, is all.</font>

1003
01:30:35,877 --> 01:30:38,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you've got an admirer.</font>

1004
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:42,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just stay away from her, all right?</font>

1005
01:31:13,082 --> 01:31:15,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">He gets his own food and all.</font>

1006
01:31:17,086 --> 01:31:20,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's company he'll be needing
when I'm gone.</font>

1007
01:31:21,506 --> 01:31:23,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will look after him, won't you?</font>

1008
01:31:24,217 --> 01:31:26,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm the only family he's got.</font>

1009
01:31:40,525 --> 01:31:42,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Feeling sentimental?</font>

1010
01:31:45,655 --> 01:31:49,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's private.
- Not to me.</font>

1011
01:31:49,784 --> 01:31:53,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">And not to the Dark Lord,
if you don't improve.</font>

1012
01:31:55,707 --> 01:31:58,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every memory he has access to
is a weapon he can use against you.</font>

1013
01:31:59,043 --> 01:32:03,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">You won't last two seconds
if he invades your mind.</font>

1014
01:32:04,382 --> 01:32:06,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're just like your father.</font>

1015
01:32:06,801 --> 01:32:08,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lazy, arrogant.</font>

1016
01:32:08,761 --> 01:32:11,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Don't say a word against my father.
- Weak.</font>

1017
01:32:11,181 --> 01:32:13,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm not weak.
- Then prove it.</font>

1018
01:32:13,975 --> 01:32:15,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">Control your emotions.</font>

1019
01:32:16,060 --> 01:32:19,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">Discipline your mind.</font>

1020
01:32:21,859 --> 01:32:23,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">Legilimens.</font>

1021
01:32:30,242 --> 01:32:31,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry.</font>

1022
01:32:31,534 --> 01:32:33,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sirius.</font>

1023
01:32:33,912 --> 01:32:35,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">I may vomit.</font>

1024
01:32:35,581 --> 01:32:36,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop it.</font>

1025
01:32:37,750 --> 01:32:40,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this what you call control?</font>

1026
01:32:40,543 --> 01:32:43,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've been at it for hours.
If I could just rest.</font>

1027
01:32:43,756 --> 01:32:47,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Dark Lord isn't resting.</font>

1028
01:32:48,802 --> 01:32:50,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">You and Black, you're two of a kind.</font>

1029
01:32:50,887 --> 01:32:54,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sentimental children forever whining
about how unfair your lives have been.</font>

1030
01:32:55,016 --> 01:32:58,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it may have escaped your notice,
but life isn't fair.</font>

1031
01:32:58,561 --> 01:33:02,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your blessed father knew that.
In fact, he frequently saw to it.</font>

1032
01:33:02,690 --> 01:33:05,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">- My father was a great man.
- Your father was a swine.</font>

1033
01:33:06,779 --> 01:33:08,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Legilimens.
- Protego.</font>

1034
01:33:13,828 --> 01:33:15,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, Moony, Padfoot.</font>

1035
01:33:15,537 --> 01:33:17,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">Snape. Expelliarmus.</font>

1036
01:33:17,789 --> 01:33:19,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice one, James.</font>

1037
01:33:19,958 --> 01:33:22,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Dad.
- Impedimenta.</font>

1038
01:33:22,461 --> 01:33:24,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">Snivellus Greasy.
Snivellus Greasy.</font>

1039
01:33:24,630 --> 01:33:27,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right. Who wants to see me
take off Snivelly's trousers?</font>

1040
01:33:27,466 --> 01:33:29,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">Snivellus Greasy.
Snivellus Greasy.</font>

1041
01:33:29,885 --> 01:33:31,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enough.</font>

1042
01:33:33,055 --> 01:33:34,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enough.</font>

1043
01:33:43,149 --> 01:33:45,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your lessons are at an end.</font>

1044
01:33:45,943 --> 01:33:47,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">I...</font>

1045
01:33:47,235 --> 01:33:50,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out.</font>

1046
01:34:07,715 --> 01:34:09,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's your name?
- Michael.</font>

1047
01:34:10,050 --> 01:34:11,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your hand's gonna be fine, Michael.</font>

1048
01:34:12,136 --> 01:34:15,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. It's not as bad as it seems. See?</font>

1049
01:34:15,346 --> 01:34:17,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's fading already.</font>

1050
01:34:17,515 --> 01:34:22,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can hardly see ours anymore,
and the pain stops after a while.</font>

1051
01:34:29,653 --> 01:34:32,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">As I told you once before, Mr. Potter...</font>

1052
01:34:32,530 --> 01:34:36,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">naughty children
deserve to be punished.</font>

1053
01:34:39,371 --> 01:34:40,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, George...</font>

1054
01:34:40,872 --> 01:34:44,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've always felt our futures lay outside
the world of academic achievement.</font>

1055
01:34:44,710 --> 01:34:49,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fred, I've been thinking
exactly the same thing.</font>

1056
01:36:01,246 --> 01:36:02,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, professor!</font>

1057
01:36:11,672 --> 01:36:13,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here you go.</font>

1058
01:36:38,408 --> 01:36:40,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ready when you are.</font>

1059
01:38:05,996 --> 01:38:09,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need that prophecy.</font>

1060
01:38:09,416 --> 01:38:11,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll have to kill me.</font>

1061
01:38:12,085 --> 01:38:16,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I will.
But first, you will fetch it for me.</font>

1062
01:38:16,840 --> 01:38:18,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Crucio.</font>

1063
01:38:21,094 --> 01:38:22,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">Crucio.</font>

1064
01:38:34,231 --> 01:38:35,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sirius.</font>

1065
01:38:35,859 --> 01:38:36,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry, are you sure?</font>

1066
01:38:37,068 --> 01:38:39,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw it. It's just like
with Mr. Weasley.</font>

1067
01:38:39,654 --> 01:38:41,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the door I've been dreaming about.</font>

1068
01:38:41,698 --> 01:38:43,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">I couldn't remember
where I'd seen it before.</font>

1069
01:38:43,949 --> 01:38:45,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sirius said Voldemort
was after something.</font>

1070
01:38:46,036 --> 01:38:49,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something he didn't have the last time,
in the Department of Mysteries.</font>

1071
01:38:49,497 --> 01:38:51,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry, please, just listen.</font>

1072
01:38:52,958 --> 01:38:54,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if Voldemort
meant for you to see this?</font>

1073
01:38:56,253 --> 01:38:59,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if he's only hurting Sirius
because he's trying to get to you?</font>

1074
01:38:59,548 --> 01:39:03,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if he is?
I'm supposed to just let him die?</font>

1075
01:39:03,220 --> 01:39:06,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hermione,
he's the only family I've got left.</font>

1076
01:39:09,266 --> 01:39:10,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do we do?</font>

1077
01:39:11,728 --> 01:39:13,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll have to use the Floo Network.</font>

1078
01:39:13,521 --> 01:39:15,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">Umbridge has the chimneys
under surveillance.</font>

1079
01:39:15,774 --> 01:39:17,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not all of them.</font>

1080
01:39:20,153 --> 01:39:21,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alohomora.</font>

1081
01:39:32,707 --> 01:39:34,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alert the Order if you can.</font>

1082
01:39:34,583 --> 01:39:38,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are you mental? We're going with you.
- It's too dangerous.</font>

1083
01:39:38,337 --> 01:39:41,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">When are you going to get it
into your head? We're in this together.</font>

1084
01:39:42,134 --> 01:39:45,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">That you are.</font>

1085
01:39:45,511 --> 01:39:48,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">Caught this one
trying to help the Weasley girl.</font>

1086
01:39:53,395 --> 01:39:55,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were going to Dumbledore,
weren't you?</font>

1087
01:39:55,689 --> 01:39:57,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- Liar.</font>

1088
01:39:57,859 --> 01:40:00,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You sent for me, headmistress?
- Snape, yes.</font>

1089
01:40:00,862 --> 01:40:04,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">The time has come for answers, whether
he wants to give them to me or not.</font>

1090
01:40:04,782 --> 01:40:06,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you brought the Veritaserum?</font>

1091
01:40:06,492 --> 01:40:09,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm afraid you've used up
all my stores interrogating students.</font>

1092
01:40:09,537 --> 01:40:12,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">The last of it on Miss Chang.</font>

1093
01:40:16,752 --> 01:40:18,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unless you wish to poison him...</font>

1094
01:40:18,378 --> 01:40:22,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I assure you, I would have
the greatest sympathy if you did.</font>

1095
01:40:23,426 --> 01:40:25,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I cannot help you.</font>

1096
01:40:27,805 --> 01:40:29,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's got Padfoot.</font>

1097
01:40:30,557 --> 01:40:34,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's got Padfoot at the place
where it's hidden.</font>

1098
01:40:34,520 --> 01:40:36,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">Padfoot? What is Padfoot?
Where what is hidden?</font>

1099
01:40:36,814 --> 01:40:38,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is he talking about, Snape?</font>

1100
01:40:45,030 --> 01:40:47,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">No idea.</font>

1101
01:40:51,537 --> 01:40:53,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very well.</font>

1102
01:40:54,081 --> 01:40:56,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">You give me no choice, Potter.</font>

1103
01:40:56,792 --> 01:40:59,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">As this is an issue
of Ministry security...</font>

1104
01:40:59,921 --> 01:41:02,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">you leave me with...</font>

1105
01:41:02,756 --> 01:41:04,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">no alternative.</font>

1106
01:41:05,510 --> 01:41:07,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Cruciatus Curse
ought to loosen your tongue.</font>

1107
01:41:07,886 --> 01:41:08,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's illegal.</font>

1108
01:41:09,095 --> 01:41:12,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">What Cornelius doesn't know
won't hurt him.</font>

1109
01:41:19,940 --> 01:41:21,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell her, Harry!</font>

1110
01:41:22,944 --> 01:41:24,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me what?</font>

1111
01:41:25,613 --> 01:41:27,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, if you won't tell her where it is...</font>

1112
01:41:28,282 --> 01:41:30,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will.</font>

1113
01:41:31,661 --> 01:41:33,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where what is?</font>

1114
01:41:34,663 --> 01:41:36,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dumbledore's secret weapon.</font>

1115
01:41:41,962 --> 01:41:43,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">How much further?</font>

1116
01:41:43,672 --> 01:41:45,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not far.</font>

1117
01:41:47,342 --> 01:41:51,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">It had to be somewhere
students wouldn't find it accidentally.</font>

1118
01:41:55,393 --> 01:41:56,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

1119
01:41:57,019 --> 01:41:58,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">Improvising.</font>

1120
01:42:07,320 --> 01:42:08,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well?</font>

1121
01:42:10,240 --> 01:42:12,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is this weapon?</font>

1122
01:42:17,289 --> 01:42:19,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">There isn't one, is there?</font>

1123
01:42:22,336 --> 01:42:24,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were trying to trick me.</font>

1124
01:42:28,676 --> 01:42:30,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know...</font>

1125
01:42:31,679 --> 01:42:33,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">I really hate children.</font>

1126
01:42:49,279 --> 01:42:53,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have no business here, centaur.
This is a Ministry matter.</font>

1127
01:42:56,369 --> 01:42:58,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lower your weapons.</font>

1128
01:42:58,206 --> 01:43:03,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">I warn you, under the law, as
creatures of near-human intelligence...</font>

1129
01:43:03,920 --> 01:43:05,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">Protego.</font>

1130
01:43:05,421 --> 01:43:06,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">How dare you?</font>

1131
01:43:07,215 --> 01:43:08,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Filthy half-breed.</font>

1132
01:43:09,466 --> 01:43:10,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Incarcerous.</font>

1133
01:43:23,730 --> 01:43:26,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please. Please stop it. Please.</font>

1134
01:43:26,484 --> 01:43:31,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, enough. I will have order.</font>

1135
01:43:39,997 --> 01:43:42,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">You filthy animal.</font>

1136
01:43:42,750 --> 01:43:45,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know who I am?</font>

1137
01:43:45,877 --> 01:43:48,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leave him alone. It's not his fault.</font>

1138
01:43:48,881 --> 01:43:50,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, he doesn't understand.</font>

1139
01:43:58,432 --> 01:44:01,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">Potter, do something.
Tell them I mean no harm.</font>

1140
01:44:02,060 --> 01:44:03,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, professor.</font>

1141
01:44:04,146 --> 01:44:05,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I must not tell lies.</font>

1142
01:44:06,106 --> 01:44:07,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

1143
01:44:07,315 --> 01:44:11,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am Senior Undersecretary
Dolores Jane Umbridge.</font>

1144
01:44:11,612 --> 01:44:13,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me go!</font>

1145
01:44:16,451 --> 01:44:18,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, Grawp.</font>

1146
01:44:18,453 --> 01:44:21,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hermione. Hermione, Sirius.</font>

1147
01:44:30,213 --> 01:44:33,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How'd you get away?
- Puking Pastilles. It wasn't pretty.</font>

1148
01:44:33,967 --> 01:44:36,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">Told them I was hungry,
wanted some sweets.</font>

1149
01:44:36,261 --> 01:44:38,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">They told me to bugger off
and ate the lot themselves.</font>

1150
01:44:39,640 --> 01:44:41,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was clever, Ron.</font>

1151
01:44:41,975 --> 01:44:44,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Has been known to happen.
- It was brilliant.</font>

1152
01:44:44,645 --> 01:44:46,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">So how are we getting to London?</font>

1153
01:44:47,814 --> 01:44:51,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, it's not that I don't appreciate
everything you've done, all of you...</font>

1154
01:44:52,194 --> 01:44:54,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I've got you
into enough trouble as it is.</font>

1155
01:44:55,072 --> 01:44:58,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dumbledore's Army's supposed to be
about doing something real.</font>

1156
01:44:58,367 --> 01:45:00,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or was that all just words to you?</font>

1157
01:45:02,372 --> 01:45:05,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe you don't have to do this
all by yourself, mate.</font>

1158
01:45:10,506 --> 01:45:12,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">So how are we going to get to London?</font>

1159
01:45:14,051 --> 01:45:16,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">We fly, of course.</font>

01:48:42,634 --> 01:48:47,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, you really should learn
to tell the difference between dreams...</font>

1174
01:48:50,641 --> 01:48:52,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">and reality.</font>

1175
01:48:54,061 --> 01:48:59,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">You saw only what the Dark Lord
wanted you to see.</font>

1176
01:48:59,734 --> 01:49:01,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, hand me the prophecy.</font>

1177
01:49:01,403 --> 01:49:03,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you do anything to us, I'll break it.</font>

1178
01:49:06,240 --> 01:49:08,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">He knows how to play.</font>

1179
01:49:08,993 --> 01:49:12,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">Itty, bitty baby.</font>

1180
01:49:12,956 --> 01:49:14,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">Potter.</font>

1181
01:49:14,750 --> 01:49:16,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bellatrix Lestrange.</font>

1182
01:49:16,793 --> 01:49:19,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">Neville Longbottom, is it?
How's Mum and Dad?</font>

1183
01:49:19,921 --> 01:49:21,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">Better, now they're
about to be avenged.</font>

1184
01:49:24,592 --> 01:49:29,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, let's everybody
just calm down...</font>

1185
01:49:29,890 --> 01:49:31,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">shall we?</font>

1186
01:49:31,557 --> 01:49:34,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">All we want is that prophecy.</font>

1187
01:49:34,185 --> 01:49:36,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why did Voldemort
need me to come and get this?</font>

1188
01:49:36,563 --> 01:49:38,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">You dare speak his name?</font>

1189
01:49:39,733 --> 01:49:41,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">You filthy half-blood!</font>

1190
01:49:41,484 --> 01:49:44,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all right.
He's just a curious lad, aren't you?</font>

1191
01:49:46,030 --> 01:49:51,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">Prophecies can only be retrieved
by those about whom they are made.</font>

1192
01:49:51,662 --> 01:49:54,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which is lucky for you, really.</font>

1193
01:49:58,167 --> 01:50:00,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">Haven't you always wondered...</font>

1194
01:50:00,628 --> 01:50:05,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">the reason for the connection
between you and the Dark Lord?</font>

1195
01:50:06,552 --> 01:50:09,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why he was unable to kill you...</font>

1196
01:50:09,221 --> 01:50:11,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">when you were just an infant?</font>

1197
01:50:13,143 --> 01:50:17,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you want to know
the secret of your scar?</font>

1198
01:50:18,856 --> 01:50:23,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">All the answers are there, Potter,
in your hand.</font>

1199
01:50:24,487 --> 01:50:26,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">All you have to do...</font>

1200
01:50:27,030 --> 01:50:28,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">is give it to me.</font>

1201
01:50:29,283 --> 01:50:32,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I can show you everything.</font>

1202
01:50:41,337 --> 01:50:43,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've waited 14 years.</font>

1203
01:50:43,715 --> 01:50:44,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know.</font>

1204
01:50:46,341 --> 01:50:49,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess I can wait a little longer.
Now. Stupefy.</font>

1205
01:50:49,429 --> 01:50:50,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stupefy.</font>

1206
01:51:06,988 --> 01:51:07,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">Levicorpus.</font>

1207
01:51:14,537 --> 01:51:16,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Petrificus Totalus.</font>

1208
01:51:16,747 --> 01:51:18,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well done, Neville.</font>

1209
01:51:27,007 --> 01:51:28,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stupefy.</font>

1210
01:51:30,302 --> 01:51:31,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Stupefy.
- Stupefy.</font>

1211
01:51:42,689 --> 01:51:44,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stupefy.</font>

1212
01:51:52,117 --> 01:51:54,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Reducto.</font>

1213
01:52:10,426 --> 01:52:12,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get back to the door.</font>

1214
01:52:47,838 --> 01:52:52,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">Department of Mysteries.
They got that bit right, didn't they?</font>

1215
01:52:57,556 --> 01:52:59,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">The voices.</font>

1216
01:53:00,018 --> 01:53:02,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you tell what they're saying?</font>

1217
01:53:03,729 --> 01:53:05,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">There aren't any voices, Harry.</font>

1218
01:53:06,649 --> 01:53:08,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's get out of here.</font>

1219
01:53:08,568 --> 01:53:10,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hear them too.</font>

1220
01:53:13,280 --> 01:53:15,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry, it's just an empty archway.</font>

1221
01:53:18,661 --> 01:53:20,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, Harry.</font>

1222
01:53:20,829 --> 01:53:22,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get behind me.</font>

1223
01:54:09,253 --> 01:54:11,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you actually believe...</font>

1224
01:54:12,131 --> 01:54:16,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">or were you truly naive enough
to think...</font>

1225
01:54:17,345 --> 01:54:22,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">that children stood a chance
against us?</font>

1226
01:54:25,979 --> 01:54:29,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll make this simple for you, Potter.</font>

1227
01:54:33,403 --> 01:54:36,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me the prophecy now...</font>

1228
01:54:36,905 --> 01:54:40,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">or watch your friends die.</font>

1229
01:54:53,840 --> 01:54:55,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't give it to him, Harry.</font>

1230
01:55:21,534 --> 01:55:24,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get away from my godson.</font>

1231
01:55:54,400 --> 01:55:56,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, listen to me.
Take the others and get out of here.</font>

1232
01:55:57,320 --> 01:55:59,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? No, I'm staying with you.</font>

1233
01:55:59,323 --> 01:56:02,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've done beautifully.</font>

1234
01:56:02,827 --> 01:56:04,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, let me take it from here.</font>

1235
01:56:04,619 --> 01:56:05,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">Black.</font>

1236
01:56:32,814 --> 01:56:34,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">Expelliarmus!</font>

1237
01:56:34,315 --> 01:56:35,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice one, James.</font>

1238
01:56:42,867 --> 01:56:44,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">Avada Kedavra.</font>

1239
01:57:04,555 --> 01:57:06,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No.</font>

1240
01:57:30,914 --> 01:57:33,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">I killed Sirius Black.</font>

1241
01:57:34,460 --> 01:57:36,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You coming to get me?
- Crucio.</font>

1242
01:57:48,765 --> 01:57:51,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've got to mean it, Harry.</font>

1243
01:57:52,103 --> 01:57:55,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">She killed him. She deserves it.</font>

1244
01:57:59,693 --> 01:58:02,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know the spell, Harry.</font>

1245
01:58:14,457 --> 01:58:16,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do it.</font>

1246
01:58:23,759 --> 01:58:26,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">So weak.</font>

1247
01:58:33,476 --> 01:58:36,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was foolish of you
to come here tonight, Tom.</font>

1248
01:58:36,855 --> 01:58:38,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Aurors are on their way.</font>

1249
01:58:38,774 --> 01:58:42,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">By which time I shall be gone,
and you...</font>

1250
01:58:44,488 --> 01:58:46,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">shall be dead.</font>

1251
02:01:00,917 --> 02:01:02,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've lost, old man.</font>

1252
02:01:22,939 --> 02:01:23,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry.</font>

1253
02:01:28,110 --> 02:01:29,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">So weak.</font>

1254
02:01:30,113 --> 02:01:32,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">So vulnerable.</font>

1255
02:01:36,619 --> 02:01:37,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at me.</font>

1256
02:01:40,164 --> 02:01:44,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry, it isn't how you are alike.</font>

1257
02:01:44,586 --> 02:01:47,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's how you are not.</font>

1258
02:01:52,010 --> 02:01:53,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry?</font>

1259
02:02:25,918 --> 02:02:27,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the weak one...</font>

1260
02:02:28,003 --> 02:02:32,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you'll never know
love or friendship.</font>

1261
02:02:35,554 --> 02:02:38,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I feel sorry for you.</font>

1262
02:03:01,496 --> 02:03:04,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a fool, Harry Potter.</font>

1263
02:03:05,917 --> 02:03:11,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you will lose everything.</font>

1264
02:03:25,979 --> 02:03:27,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's back.</font>

1265
02:04:35,381 --> 02:04:37,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know how you feel, Harry.</font>

1266
02:04:37,216 --> 02:04:38,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you don't.</font>

1267
02:04:44,474 --> 02:04:45,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's my fault.</font>

1268
02:04:46,016 --> 02:04:49,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, the fault is mine.</font>

1269
02:04:50,313 --> 02:04:52,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew it was only a matter of time...</font>

1270
02:04:52,231 --> 02:04:55,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">before Voldemort made the connection
between you.</font>

1271
02:04:56,110 --> 02:05:00,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought by distancing myself from you,
as I have done all year...</font>

1272
02:05:00,532 --> 02:05:05,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">he'd be less tempted, and therefore
you might be more protected.</font>

1273
02:05:08,582 --> 02:05:11,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">The prophecy said:</font>

1274
02:05:12,543 --> 02:05:16,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Neither one can live
while the other one survives."</font>

1275
02:05:17,841 --> 02:05:23,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">It means one of us is gonna
have to kill the other, in the end.</font>

1276
02:05:25,891 --> 02:05:27,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

1277
02:05:27,935 --> 02:05:29,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why didn't you tell me?</font>

1278
02:05:29,686 --> 02:05:33,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">For the same reason
you tried to save Sirius.</font>

1279
02:05:33,440 --> 02:05:35,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">The same reason your friends saved you.</font>

1280
02:05:36,735 --> 02:05:40,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">After all these years,
after all you've suffered...</font>

1281
02:05:40,405 --> 02:05:43,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't want to cause you
any more pain.</font>

1282
02:05:44,786 --> 02:05:46,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">I cared too much about you.</font>

1283
02:06:11,770 --> 02:06:14,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">How come you're not at the feast?</font>

1284
02:06:14,273 --> 02:06:18,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lost all my possessions. Apparently
people have been hiding them.</font>

1285
02:06:18,985 --> 02:06:19,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's awful.</font>

1286
02:06:20,195 --> 02:06:22,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it's all good fun.</font>

1287
02:06:22,239 --> 02:06:25,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">But as it's the last night,
I really do need them back.</font>

1288
02:06:25,868 --> 02:06:28,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you want any help finding them?</font>

1289
02:06:31,123 --> 02:06:34,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry about your godfather, Harry.</font>

1290
02:06:41,384 --> 02:06:43,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you sure you don't want
any help looking?</font>

1291
02:06:43,636 --> 02:06:45,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's all right.</font>

1292
02:06:45,470 --> 02:06:47,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyway, my mum always said...</font>

1293
02:06:47,806 --> 02:06:51,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">the things we lose have a way
of coming back to us in the end.</font>

1294
02:06:54,896 --> 02:06:58,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">If not always in the way we expect.</font>

1295
02:06:59,652 --> 02:07:02,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Think I'll just go have some pudding.</font>

1296
02:07:38,024 --> 02:07:40,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been thinking about something
Dumbledore said to me.</font>

1297
02:07:41,109 --> 02:07:42,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's that?</font>

1298
02:07:43,404 --> 02:07:46,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">That even though
we've got a fight ahead of us...</font>

1299
02:07:46,364 --> 02:07:49,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">we've got one thing
that Voldemort doesn't have.</font>

1300
02:07:49,618 --> 02:07:51,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah?</font>

1301
02:07:53,038 --> 02:07:55,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something worth fighting for.</font>
