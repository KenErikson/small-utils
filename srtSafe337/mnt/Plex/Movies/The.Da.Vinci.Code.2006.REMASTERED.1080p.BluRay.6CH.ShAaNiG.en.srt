00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop now.</font>

2
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me where it is.</font>

3
00:02:24,336 --> 00:02:28,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">You and your brethren possess
what is not rightfully yours.</font>

4
00:02:29,007 --> 00:02:32,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know what
you are talking about.</font>

5
00:02:33,345 --> 00:02:36,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it a secret you will die for?</font>

6
00:02:37,182 --> 00:02:39,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Please.
- As you wish.</font>

7
00:02:39,918 --> 00:02:41,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait!</font>

8
00:02:45,423 --> 00:02:47,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">My God, forgive me.</font>

9
00:02:49,094 --> 00:02:51,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the sacristy...</font>

10
00:02:51,363 --> 00:02:54,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">the church of Saint-Sulpice,
is the Rose Line.</font>

11
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">Beneath the Rose.</font>

12
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:01,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

13
00:03:34,973 --> 00:03:36,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

14
00:03:37,075 --> 00:03:38,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

15
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:54,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">Symbols are a language that
can help us understand our past.</font>

16
00:03:54,825 --> 00:03:59,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">As the saying goes,
a picture says a thousand words...</font>

17
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:02,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">but which words?</font>

18
00:04:03,167 --> 00:04:06,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Interpret for me, please, this symbol.
First thing that comes to mind.</font>

19
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:09,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hatred, racism.
- Ku Klux Klan.</font>

20
00:04:09,373 --> 00:04:14,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, yes, interesting. But they would
disagree with you in Spain.</font>

21
00:04:14,945 --> 00:04:18,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">There, they are robes
worn by priests.</font>

22
00:04:18,616 --> 00:04:20,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now this symbol. Anyone?</font>

23
00:04:21,018 --> 00:04:22,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">Evil.</font>

24
00:04:23,287 --> 00:04:24,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">In English, please.</font>

25
00:04:24,622 --> 00:04:25,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Devil's pitchfork.</font>

26
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:28,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Poor, poor Poseidon.</font>

27
00:04:28,525 --> 00:04:33,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is his trident. A symbol of power
to millions of the ancients.</font>

28
00:04:33,964 --> 00:04:35,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now this symbol.</font>

29
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Madonna and child.
- Faith. Christianity.</font>

30
00:04:38,869 --> 00:04:42,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No, it's the pagan god
Horus and his mother, Isis...</font>

31
00:04:42,806 --> 00:04:45,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">centuries before
the birth of Christ.</font>

32
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:49,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">Understanding our past
determines actively...</font>

33
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">our ability to understand
the present.</font>

34
00:04:52,883 --> 00:04:57,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">So how do we sift truth from belief?</font>

35
00:04:57,655 --> 00:05:01,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do we write our own histories,
personally or culturally...</font>

36
00:05:01,392 --> 00:05:03,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">and thereby define ourselves?</font>

37
00:05:03,661 --> 00:05:08,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do we penetrate years,
centuries, of historical distortion...</font>

38
00:05:08,465 --> 00:05:11,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">to find original truth?</font>

39
00:05:11,468 --> 00:05:14,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tonight, this will be our quest.</font>

40
00:05:14,905 --> 00:05:18,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">I still think that his whole take on phi
was a little far-fetched.</font>

41
00:05:18,409 --> 00:05:24,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think so. I think that the
golden ratio is everywhere in nature.</font>

42
00:05:25,516 --> 00:05:27,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure, I can do that.</font>

43
00:05:27,217 --> 00:05:30,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">My son is a student
of yours at Harvard.</font>

44
00:05:30,387 --> 00:05:32,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Michael Culp? He adores you.
- Oh, yeah.</font>

45
00:05:32,856 --> 00:05:34,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">He says you're the best teacher
he's ever had.</font>

46
00:05:35,092 --> 00:05:39,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ms. Culp, I think I already gave
Michael an A-minus.</font>

47
00:05:39,263 --> 00:05:40,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">He told me. Thank you.</font>

48
00:05:40,831 --> 00:05:42,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Langdon?</font>

49
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:44,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi.</font>

50
00:05:44,501 --> 00:05:45,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bonjour, professor.</font>

51
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:51,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Lieutenant Collet from DCPJ.
A kind of French FBI.</font>

52
00:05:52,443 --> 00:05:55,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you take a look
at this photo, please?</font>

53
00:05:55,212 --> 00:05:58,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">My police chief, Capitaine Fache,
had hoped...</font>

54
00:05:58,282 --> 00:06:01,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">considering your expertise
and the markings on the body...</font>

55
00:06:02,052 --> 00:06:03,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">you might assist us.</font>

56
00:06:12,229 --> 00:06:14,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you excuse me a moment?</font>

57
00:06:17,601 --> 00:06:19,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was supposed to have
drinks with him.</font>

58
00:06:19,636 --> 00:06:20,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, we know.</font>

59
00:06:22,172 --> 00:06:24,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">We found your name
in his daily planner.</font>

60
00:06:25,476 --> 00:06:28,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">He never showed.
I waited for over an hour.</font>

61
00:06:31,482 --> 00:06:34,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would someone do this to him?</font>

62
00:06:34,351 --> 00:06:37,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you misunderstand, professor.</font>

63
00:06:37,821 --> 00:06:39,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was shot, yes.</font>

64
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">But what you see
in the photograph...</font>

65
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Monsieur Sauniere did to himself.</font>

66
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:52,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">Teacher, all four are dead.</font>

67
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:56,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">The senechaux and the
Grand Master himself.</font>

68
00:06:57,106 --> 00:07:00,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I assume
you have the location.</font>

69
00:07:00,376 --> 00:07:03,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">Confirmed by all.</font>

70
00:07:03,646 --> 00:07:06,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">Independently.</font>

71
00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:11,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had feared the Priory's penchant
for secrecy might prevail.</font>

72
00:07:14,724 --> 00:07:18,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">The prospect of death
is strong motivation.</font>

73
00:07:22,265 --> 00:07:24,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is here.</font>

74
00:07:24,934 --> 00:07:27,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">In Paris, Teacher.</font>

75
00:07:28,304 --> 00:07:33,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">It hides beneath the Rose
in Saint-Sulpice.</font>

76
00:07:34,277 --> 00:07:36,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will go forth, Silas.</font>

77
00:08:49,986 --> 00:08:53,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">I chastise my body.</font>

78
00:09:31,227 --> 00:09:33,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Capitaine Fache is waiting for you.</font>

79
00:09:41,671 --> 00:09:42,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

80
00:09:54,283 --> 00:09:55,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mr. Langdon.
- Yes.</font>

81
00:09:56,252 --> 00:09:58,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Captain Bezu Fache.</font>

82
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">You like our pyramid?</font>

83
00:10:00,789 --> 00:10:01,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's magnificent.</font>

84
00:10:02,691 --> 00:10:04,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">A scar on the face of Paris.</font>

85
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">After me, please.</font>

86
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:17,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the pairing
of those two pyramids.</font>

87
00:10:17,872 --> 00:10:19,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's unique.</font>

88
00:10:19,374 --> 00:10:21,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">The two are geometric echoes.</font>

89
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:22,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fascinating.</font>

90
00:10:25,447 --> 00:10:28,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not sure how much help
I'm gonna be here this evening.</font>

91
00:10:33,555 --> 00:10:35,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">How well did you know the curator?</font>

92
00:10:35,757 --> 00:10:38,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not at all. We met only once.</font>

93
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were on a...</font>

94
00:10:41,663 --> 00:10:43,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">On a panel together.</font>

95
00:10:44,032 --> 00:10:46,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something is funny?</font>

96
00:10:46,935 --> 00:10:48,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">We didn't agree on much.</font>

97
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:52,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frankly, I was surprised
when he contacted me.</font>

98
00:11:00,348 --> 00:11:02,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could we take the stairs?</font>

99
00:11:17,298 --> 00:11:20,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">So Sauniere requested
tonight's meeting.</font>

100
00:11:20,769 --> 00:11:21,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

101
00:11:22,103 --> 00:11:23,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">How? Did he call you?</font>

102
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">E-mail. He heard I was in Paris.</font>

103
00:11:29,544 --> 00:11:31,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">Had something to discuss.</font>

104
00:11:31,546 --> 00:11:32,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

105
00:11:37,686 --> 00:11:40,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">You seem uncomfortable.</font>

106
00:11:56,104 --> 00:11:59,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are any of those real?
- Of course not.</font>

107
00:11:59,908 --> 00:12:03,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you know something
of security procedures.</font>

108
00:12:03,845 --> 00:12:08,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I know video surveillance in
a museum this size is cost-prohibitive.</font>

109
00:12:08,249 --> 00:12:10,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Most now rely on containment.</font>

110
00:12:10,952 --> 00:12:14,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, forget about
keeping the criminals out.</font>

111
00:12:14,355 --> 00:12:16,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now we keep them in.</font>

112
00:12:22,097 --> 00:12:26,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Grand Gallery.
This is where you found the body.</font>

113
00:12:26,367 --> 00:12:28,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">How would you know that?</font>

114
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:34,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">I recognize the parquet floor
from the Polaroid. It's unmistakable.</font>

115
00:12:43,485 --> 00:12:44,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dear God.</font>

116
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:50,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's cover the talking points again,
Your Eminence.</font>

117
00:12:51,092 --> 00:12:53,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">Many call Opus Dei
a brainwashing cult.</font>

118
00:12:54,162 --> 00:12:57,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">Others, an ultraconservative
Christian secret society.</font>

119
00:12:57,532 --> 00:13:00,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We are a simple Catholic church.
- Simple?</font>

120
00:13:00,435 --> 00:13:03,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">With a brand-new $47-million
headquarters in Manhattan.</font>

121
00:13:03,371 --> 00:13:06,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our followers are generous,
should we apologize for that?</font>

122
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps a less defensive tack,
Your Eminence.</font>

123
00:13:09,143 --> 00:13:11,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">The press continue
to be harsh with us.</font>

124
00:13:13,113 --> 00:13:17,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are not Cafeteria Catholics.</font>

125
00:13:17,451 --> 00:13:19,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't pick and choose
which rules to follow.</font>

126
00:13:19,686 --> 00:13:22,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">We follow doctrine. Rigorously.</font>

127
00:13:23,123 --> 00:13:26,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does doctrine necessarily
include vows of chastity, tithing...</font>

128
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:30,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">and atonement for sins through
self-flagellation and the cilice?</font>

129
00:13:30,764 --> 00:13:34,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">Many of our followers are married.
Many of them have families.</font>

130
00:13:35,135 --> 00:13:37,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only a small proportion
choose to live ascetically...</font>

131
00:13:38,172 --> 00:13:40,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the cloisters
of our residential halls.</font>

132
00:13:41,809 --> 00:13:44,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we are all united in God's work
around the world.</font>

133
00:13:44,478 --> 00:13:48,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Surely that is an admirable way
to lead one's life.</font>

134
00:13:48,816 --> 00:13:51,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are some media referring
to Opus Dei as "God's mafia"?</font>

135
00:13:51,552 --> 00:13:55,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">Obviously, some people fear
what they don't understand.</font>

136
00:13:56,924 --> 00:13:59,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">And because the war finally
draws to a close.</font>

137
00:13:59,593 --> 00:14:03,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Bishop, we need to stay on message.
- That will be all, Michael, thank you.</font>

138
00:14:03,797 --> 00:14:04,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aringarosa.</font>

139
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:09,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Silas has succeeded.
The legend is true.</font>

140
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:12,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">It hides beneath the Rose.</font>

141
00:14:12,372 --> 00:14:15,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">My part of our bargain
is nearly fulfilled.</font>

142
00:14:15,943 --> 00:14:18,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">I meet the council in an hour.</font>

143
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:23,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will have your money tonight,
Teacher.</font>

144
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:26,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Vitruvian Man.</font>

145
00:14:26,286 --> 00:14:29,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's one of Leonardo da Vinci's
most famous sketches.</font>

146
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:31,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the star on his skin?</font>

147
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:33,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">A pentacle.</font>

148
00:14:33,293 --> 00:14:34,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">And its meaning?</font>

149
00:14:35,128 --> 00:14:36,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">The pentacle is ancient.</font>

150
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:42,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">Symbols carry different meanings
in different settings.</font>

151
00:14:42,769 --> 00:14:45,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">This symbol, professor.
This setting.</font>

152
00:14:45,572 --> 00:14:47,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">The pentacle is
a pagan religious icon.</font>

153
00:14:48,442 --> 00:14:50,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Devil worship.</font>

154
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:54,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No, no, no.
The pentacle before that.</font>

155
00:14:55,482 --> 00:14:57,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a symbol for Venus.</font>

156
00:14:58,285 --> 00:15:00,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">It represents the female half
of all things.</font>

157
00:15:00,854 --> 00:15:04,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a concept called "the divine
goddess" by religious historians.</font>

158
00:15:05,659 --> 00:15:08,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are telling me that
Sauniere's last act on earth...</font>

159
00:15:08,962 --> 00:15:13,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">was to draw a goddess symbol
on his chest? Why?</font>

160
00:15:14,768 --> 00:15:18,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">Captain Fache,
obviously I can't tell you why.</font>

161
00:15:18,939 --> 00:15:22,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can tell you he, as well as anyone,
knows the meaning of this symbol...</font>

162
00:15:22,743 --> 00:15:25,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it has nothing to do
with worshiping the devil.</font>

163
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:27,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is that so?
- Yes.</font>

164
00:15:27,247 --> 00:15:28,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then...</font>

165
00:15:29,816 --> 00:15:31,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">what do you make of this?</font>

166
00:15:32,052 --> 00:15:36,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">"O, Draconian devil.
Oh, lame saint."</font>

167
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:39,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a phrase.
Doesn't mean anything, not to me.</font>

168
00:15:40,027 --> 00:15:43,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">What would you do if you had such
limited time to send a message?</font>

169
00:15:45,065 --> 00:15:49,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I suppose
I'd try to identify my killer.</font>

170
00:15:50,337 --> 00:15:51,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">Precisely.</font>

171
00:15:52,172 --> 00:15:53,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">Precisely.</font>

172
00:15:54,007 --> 00:15:55,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, professor...</font>

173
00:15:56,576 --> 00:15:58,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">Officer Neveu.</font>

174
00:15:58,845 --> 00:16:00,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, pardon the interruption.</font>

175
00:16:00,547 --> 00:16:01,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is not the time.</font>

176
00:16:01,715 --> 00:16:03,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">I received the crime-scene jpegs
at headquarters...</font>

177
00:16:04,051 --> 00:16:05,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I've deciphered the code.</font>

178
00:16:06,186 --> 00:16:07,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a Fibonacci sequence.</font>

179
00:16:07,955 --> 00:16:10,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the code Sauniere
left on the floor.</font>

180
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:12,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">Headquarters sent me
to explain, captain.</font>

181
00:16:12,992 --> 00:16:14,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is the Fibonacci sequence.</font>

182
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">The numbers are out of order.</font>

183
00:16:16,128 --> 00:16:18,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">But before that, I have an urgent
message for Professor Langdon.</font>

184
00:16:19,131 --> 00:16:20,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right?</font>

185
00:16:20,766 --> 00:16:21,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pardon me?</font>

186
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:27,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Sophie Neveu,
French police, Cryptology.</font>

187
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your embassy called Division.</font>

188
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, monsieur, they said
it was a matter of life and death.</font>

189
00:16:39,652 --> 00:16:43,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the number of your
embassy's messaging service.</font>

190
00:16:43,656 --> 00:16:45,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, thank you.</font>

191
00:16:52,331 --> 00:16:54,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, you've reached
the home of Sophie Neveu.</font>

192
00:16:55,434 --> 00:16:58,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Miss Neveu? This...</font>

193
00:16:58,337 --> 00:16:59,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. That's the right number.</font>

194
00:17:00,072 --> 00:17:02,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have to dial an access code
to pick up your messages.</font>

195
00:17:02,775 --> 00:17:03,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I'm getting...</font>

196
00:17:03,943 --> 00:17:06,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a three-digit code.
It's on the paper I gave you.</font>

197
00:17:15,855 --> 00:17:18,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Langdon,
do not react to this message.</font>

198
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:22,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must follow my directions
very closely and, above all...</font>

199
00:17:22,561 --> 00:17:24,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">reveal nothing to Captain Fache.</font>

200
00:17:25,064 --> 00:17:27,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are in grave danger.</font>

201
00:17:40,479 --> 00:17:41,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Church of Saint-Sulpice.</font>

202
00:17:42,248 --> 00:17:43,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good evening, Sister.</font>

203
00:17:44,884 --> 00:17:48,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need you to show someone
our church tonight.</font>

204
00:17:49,088 --> 00:17:50,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course, Father.</font>

205
00:17:51,057 --> 00:17:52,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">But so late?</font>

206
00:17:53,993 --> 00:17:54,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wouldn't tomorrow...?</font>

207
00:17:55,161 --> 00:17:59,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a request from an
important bishop of Opus Dei.</font>

208
00:18:00,633 --> 00:18:03,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">It would be my pleasure.</font>

209
00:18:26,992 --> 00:18:30,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's been an accident. A friend.</font>

210
00:18:30,262 --> 00:18:32,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to fly home in the morning.</font>

211
00:18:32,465 --> 00:18:33,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see.</font>

212
00:18:33,933 --> 00:18:37,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is there a restroom I could use? I just
wanna splash some water on my face.</font>

213
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:39,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

214
00:18:41,474 --> 00:18:44,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">She said it is meaningless.</font>

215
00:18:45,077 --> 00:18:46,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mathematical joke.</font>

216
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it meaningless?</font>

217
00:18:52,384 --> 00:18:54,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll take another look
when I come back.</font>

218
00:18:58,324 --> 00:19:00,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry. Of course.</font>

219
00:19:18,543 --> 00:19:20,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you have a message
from Sauniere?</font>

220
00:19:21,479 --> 00:19:23,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you talking about?</font>

221
00:19:24,249 --> 00:19:25,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">Crazy old man.</font>

222
00:19:25,884 --> 00:19:28,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have me confused with
someone else.</font>

223
00:19:28,686 --> 00:19:30,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was asked to come here
and consult.</font>

224
00:19:30,655 --> 00:19:32,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you are
sous surveillance cachee.</font>

225
00:19:32,724 --> 00:19:34,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, and...</font>

226
00:19:34,526 --> 00:19:36,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

227
00:19:36,327 --> 00:19:40,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bring the suspect to the crime scene
and hope he incriminates himself.</font>

228
00:19:40,431 --> 00:19:41,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">Suspect?</font>

229
00:19:42,066 --> 00:19:43,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">Check your jacket pocket.</font>

230
00:19:45,003 --> 00:19:46,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just look.</font>

231
00:19:50,675 --> 00:19:52,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">GPS tracking dot.</font>

232
00:19:52,243 --> 00:19:55,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">Accurate within two feet
anywhere on the globe.</font>

233
00:19:55,513 --> 00:19:59,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">The agent who picked you up
slipped it into your jacket...</font>

234
00:20:00,518 --> 00:20:02,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">in case you tried to run.</font>

235
00:20:04,155 --> 00:20:06,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have you on a little leash,
professor.</font>

236
00:20:16,234 --> 00:20:18,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would I try to run?
I didn't do anything.</font>

237
00:20:18,536 --> 00:20:22,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, what do you think about
the fourth line of text...</font>

238
00:20:22,774 --> 00:20:25,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fache wiped clean
before you arrived?</font>

239
00:20:31,482 --> 00:20:35,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">He brought you here to force a
confession, Professor Langdon.</font>

240
00:20:38,489 --> 00:20:41,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's still in there?
What's he doing?</font>

241
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:49,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fache isn't even looking
for other suspects, okay?</font>

242
00:20:49,601 --> 00:20:51,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">He is sure you're guilty.</font>

243
00:20:54,739 --> 00:20:57,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">When did Sauniere contact you?</font>

244
00:20:57,542 --> 00:20:58,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Today?
- Yes, yes.</font>

245
00:20:58,776 --> 00:21:00,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">What time? What time?</font>

246
00:21:01,045 --> 00:21:02,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">At 3. Around 3. Three.</font>

247
00:21:03,081 --> 00:21:05,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">The gallery alarm was triggered at 8.
You were...</font>

248
00:21:05,984 --> 00:21:07,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I was giving a lecture.
- At 9.</font>

249
00:21:07,885 --> 00:21:12,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">You had the privacy light on
in your hotel room until 8:30, right?</font>

250
00:21:12,857 --> 00:21:16,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">We call Fache "the Bull."
Once he starts, he doesn't stop.</font>

251
00:21:16,761 --> 00:21:19,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">He can arrest you and detain you
for months while he builds a case.</font>

252
00:21:20,131 --> 00:21:23,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">And by then whatever Sauniere
wanted you to tell me will be useless.</font>

253
00:21:23,701 --> 00:21:25,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop it! Just stop!</font>

254
00:21:26,404 --> 00:21:27,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are you?</font>

255
00:21:28,106 --> 00:21:30,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you talking about?
Tell you what?</font>

256
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:34,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe who really killed him.</font>

257
00:21:40,652 --> 00:21:43,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Fibonacci sequence.</font>

258
00:21:43,421 --> 00:21:45,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe Sauniere wrote it...</font>

259
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:48,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">so his investigation would
include cryptographers.</font>

260
00:21:52,764 --> 00:21:54,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's quite a leap, isn't it?</font>

261
00:21:54,699 --> 00:21:56,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

262
00:21:57,435 --> 00:21:59,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the letters.</font>

263
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:00,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">"P.S."</font>

264
00:22:00,538 --> 00:22:02,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">P.S., postscript.</font>

265
00:22:06,144 --> 00:22:10,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Princess Sophie."
Yeah. Silly, I know.</font>

266
00:22:10,315 --> 00:22:13,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I was only a girl
when I lived with him.</font>

267
00:22:18,756 --> 00:22:21,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jacques Sauniere
was my grandfather.</font>

268
00:22:26,463 --> 00:22:29,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">Apparently, it was his dying wish
that we meet.</font>

269
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:33,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you help me understand why...</font>

270
00:22:34,004 --> 00:22:37,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will get you to your embassy,
where we cannot arrest you.</font>

271
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:41,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fache was never gonna let me
just stroll out of here, was he?</font>

272
00:22:42,412 --> 00:22:43,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

273
00:22:44,614 --> 00:22:48,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we are to get away from here,
we must find another way.</font>

274
00:22:59,463 --> 00:23:01,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">What exactly do you propose?</font>

275
00:23:11,274 --> 00:23:14,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sauniere was reading his book.</font>

276
00:23:14,511 --> 00:23:16,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Blood trail."</font>

277
00:23:18,382 --> 00:23:20,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me, captain.</font>

278
00:23:20,384 --> 00:23:24,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">Crypto called.
They identified the code.</font>

279
00:23:24,621 --> 00:23:26,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">Neveu told us already.</font>

280
00:23:26,623 --> 00:23:30,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should have fired her on the spot,
barging in like that.</font>

281
00:23:30,627 --> 00:23:32,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

282
00:23:32,696 --> 00:23:35,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">Except they didn't send Neveu.</font>

283
00:23:37,734 --> 00:23:38,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

284
00:23:39,069 --> 00:23:42,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Captain, look at this.</font>

285
00:23:44,174 --> 00:23:45,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">He jumped!</font>

286
00:23:45,809 --> 00:23:46,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shit.</font>

287
00:23:49,212 --> 00:23:52,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's moving again. And fast.</font>

288
00:23:52,916 --> 00:23:54,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">He must be in a car.</font>

289
00:23:56,119 --> 00:24:00,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's going south
on Pont du Carrousel.</font>

290
00:24:09,032 --> 00:24:10,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bastard.</font>

291
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:36,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">That cop will check
the whole lower floor.</font>

292
00:24:40,564 --> 00:24:42,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will only take a moment.</font>

293
00:24:43,366 --> 00:24:44,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course.</font>

294
00:24:53,343 --> 00:24:55,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">He is much older than I remember.</font>

295
00:25:07,257 --> 00:25:10,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hadn't seen or spoken to him
in a very long time.</font>

296
00:25:19,769 --> 00:25:23,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">He phoned my office today.
Several times.</font>

297
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said it was a matter
of life and death.</font>

298
00:25:28,477 --> 00:25:31,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought it was another trick
to get back in touch.</font>

299
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:37,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">It seems when
he couldn't speak to me...</font>

300
00:25:38,521 --> 00:25:40,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">he reached out to you.</font>

301
00:25:46,729 --> 00:25:49,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever he needed
so badly to say...</font>

302
00:25:50,499 --> 00:25:53,297

<font color="#FFFFFF">- Wait a minute.
- Professor?</font>

304
00:26:22,932 --> 00:26:24,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

305
00:26:25,034 --> 00:26:26,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">It can't be that easy.</font>

306
00:26:27,603 --> 00:26:30,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is wrong.
Yeah. See? This is wrong.</font>

307
00:26:32,374 --> 00:26:36,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Fibonacci numbers only
make sense when they're in order.</font>

308
00:26:36,211 --> 00:26:37,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">These are scrambled.</font>

309
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:41,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">If he was trying to reach out,
maybe he was doing it in code.</font>

310
00:26:41,817 --> 00:26:43,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you hold this, please?</font>

311
00:26:45,821 --> 00:26:47,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">This phrase is meaningless.</font>

312
00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:54,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unless you assume these letters
are out of order too.</font>

313
00:26:54,797 --> 00:26:55,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">An anagram.</font>

314
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:09,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have eidetic memory?</font>

315
00:27:09,812 --> 00:27:13,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not quite. But I can pretty much
remember what I see.</font>

316
00:27:34,737 --> 00:27:36,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anagram is right.</font>

317
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:40,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">"O, Draconian devil. Oh, lame saint"</font>

318
00:27:40,843 --> 00:27:43,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Leonardo da Vinci.
The Mona Lisa."</font>

319
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:47,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor, the Mona Lisa
is right over here.</font>

320
00:27:53,656 --> 00:27:58,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at this. He must have
thrown it from the window.</font>

321
00:27:58,961 --> 00:28:00,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Smart to hit the truck.</font>

322
00:28:00,963 --> 00:28:04,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, you admire him now?</font>

323
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:08,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're stupid.
Who did we leave at the museum?</font>

324
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:11,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ledoux? Get him on the radio!</font>

325
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her smile is in
the lower spatial frequencies.</font>

326
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:18,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">The horizon is significantly lower
on the left than it is on the right.</font>

327
00:28:18,514 --> 00:28:19,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

328
00:28:19,782 --> 00:28:23,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, see, she appears larger
from the left than on the right.</font>

329
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:26,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">Historically, the left was female,
the right was male.</font>

330
00:28:27,189 --> 00:28:28,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">The sacred feminine.</font>

331
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:31,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you say that?</font>

332
00:28:31,592 --> 00:28:35,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something Sauniere said
the first time we came here.</font>

333
00:28:38,666 --> 00:28:40,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">There. Blood.</font>

334
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

335
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:58,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">"So dark the con of man."</font>

336
00:28:58,953 --> 00:29:02,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. It doesn't say that.</font>

337
00:29:02,457 --> 00:29:04,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it another anagram?
Can you break it?</font>

338
00:29:09,697 --> 00:29:12,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor, hurry. Hurry!</font>

339
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:16,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">Moon. Sermon. Charms.</font>

340
00:29:17,004 --> 00:29:20,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">Demons. Omens. Codes.
Monks. Ranks. Rocks.</font>

343
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:36,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">Careful. Careful.</font>

344
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:47,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">This can't be this. The fleur-de-lis.</font>

345
00:30:05,653 --> 00:30:06,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay where you are!</font>

346
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:10,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let go of the painting...</font>

347
00:30:10,958 --> 00:30:12,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">and put it on the ground.</font>

348
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:18,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. You put your gun down.</font>

349
00:30:19,133 --> 00:30:21,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now!</font>

350
00:30:21,369 --> 00:30:23,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or else I will destroy the painting.</font>

351
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hurry up!</font>

352
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:29,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">Slide your gun to me.</font>

353
00:30:32,246 --> 00:30:33,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be careful.</font>

354
00:30:33,815 --> 00:30:35,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never really liked this painting.</font>

355
00:30:56,704 --> 00:30:58,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">Run.</font>

356
00:31:28,169 --> 00:31:29,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was Sauniere's.</font>

357
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:33,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remember finding it once
when I was a girl.</font>

358
00:31:34,275 --> 00:31:36,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'd promised
he'd give it to me one day.</font>

359
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:39,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you ever heard
those words before, Sophie?</font>

360
00:31:39,713 --> 00:31:41,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">"So dark the con of man"?</font>

361
00:31:41,314 --> 00:31:42,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Have you?</font>

362
00:31:43,116 --> 00:31:46,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">When you were a child, were you
aware of any secret gatherings?</font>

363
00:31:47,754 --> 00:31:50,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anything ritualistic in nature?</font>

364
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:53,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">Meetings your grandfather
would've wanted kept secret?</font>

365
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was there ever any talk of something
called the Priory of Sion?</font>

366
00:31:57,397 --> 00:32:00,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">The what? Why are you
asking these things?</font>

367
00:32:00,533 --> 00:32:03,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Priory of Sion is a myth.</font>

368
00:32:03,203 --> 00:32:07,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">One of the world's oldest and most
secret societies, with leaders like...</font>

369
00:32:07,874 --> 00:32:10,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir Isaac Newton,
da Vinci himself.</font>

370
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:12,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">The fleur-de-lis is their crest.</font>

371
00:32:12,812 --> 00:32:15,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're guardians of a secret
they supposedly refer to...</font>

372
00:32:15,548 --> 00:32:17,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">as "the dark con of man."</font>

373
00:32:18,351 --> 00:32:19,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">But what secret?</font>

374
00:32:20,287 --> 00:32:25,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Priory of Sion protects
the source of God's power on earth.</font>

375
00:32:34,501 --> 00:32:36,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't do this by myself.</font>

376
00:32:36,937 --> 00:32:39,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm in enough trouble as it is.
That's my embassy.</font>

377
00:32:40,073 --> 00:32:41,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please.</font>

378
00:32:41,341 --> 00:32:42,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even if we could get out of this...</font>

379
00:32:43,043 --> 00:32:44,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

380
00:33:20,814 --> 00:33:24,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no. You're not gonna make it.
You're not gonna make it!</font>

381
00:33:31,825 --> 00:33:33,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that was...</font>

382
00:33:45,372 --> 00:33:47,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">We won't last long in this car.</font>

383
00:33:47,374 --> 00:33:50,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fache doesn't like to be eluded,
even on a good day.</font>

384
00:33:50,443 --> 00:33:52,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to get out of sight.</font>

385
00:34:10,697 --> 00:34:12,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">Christ, give me strength.</font>

386
00:34:25,512 --> 00:34:29,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are a ghost.</font>

387
00:34:31,885 --> 00:34:34,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Christ, give me strength.</font>

388
00:36:09,047 --> 00:36:11,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stealing in a house of God!</font>

389
00:36:26,031 --> 00:36:27,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are an angel.</font>

390
00:36:30,502 --> 00:36:32,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">Christ, give me strength.</font>

391
00:36:58,197 --> 00:37:00,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have powerful friends.</font>

392
00:37:01,099 --> 00:37:04,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bishop Aringarosa
has been kind to me.</font>

393
00:37:04,836 --> 00:37:08,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could not miss this chance
to pray inside the Saint-Sulpice.</font>

394
00:37:09,708 --> 00:37:12,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">A pity you couldn't wait for morning.</font>

395
00:37:12,377 --> 00:37:14,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">The light is not ideal.</font>

396
00:37:15,214 --> 00:37:19,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me, Sister, please,
of the Rose Line.</font>

397
00:37:19,785 --> 00:37:24,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">A rose line is any line that goes from
the North to South Poles.</font>

398

<font color="#FFFFFF">Set into the streets of Paris,
135 brass markers...</font>

this very church.</font>

401
00:37:35,634 --> 00:37:37,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">It hides beneath the Rose.</font>

402
00:37:37,669 --> 00:37:38,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry?</font>

403
00:37:40,138 --> 00:37:41,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sister.</font>

404
00:37:44,076 --> 00:37:47,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do not want to keep you.
I will show myself out.</font>

405
00:37:50,581 --> 00:37:51,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">I insist.</font>

406
00:37:55,987 --> 00:37:58,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">May the peace of the Lord
be with you.</font>

407
00:38:00,791 --> 00:38:02,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">And with you.</font>

408
00:38:24,215 --> 00:38:27,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gray Smart Car. Black roof.</font>

409

<font color="#FFFFFF">Corner of Denain Boulevard
at the train station.</font>

410
00:38:31,889 --> 00:38:32,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">How could you let them get away?</font>

411
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:36,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why not just shoot the damn painting?
Imbecile!</font>

412
00:38:36,294 --> 00:38:39,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should put his cigar
out in your hand!</font>

413
00:38:39,363 --> 00:38:40,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out of here!</font>

414
00:38:42,833 --> 00:38:48,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">They found Neveu's car
abandoned at the train station.</font>

415
00:38:49,106 --> 00:38:53,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">And two tickets to Brussels paid for
with Langdon's credit card.</font>

416
00:38:54,245 --> 00:38:55,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">A decoy, I'm sure.</font>

417
00:38:55,913 --> 00:38:58,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">All the same,
send an officer to the station.</font>

418
00:38:58,582 --> 00:39:01,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">Question all the taxi drivers.
I'll put this on the wire.</font>

419
00:39:01,419 --> 00:39:04,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Interpol? We're not sure he's guilty.</font>

420
00:39:04,588 --> 00:39:08,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know he's guilty. Beyond a doubt.</font>

421
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:11,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robert Langdon is guilty.</font>

422
00:39:20,538 --> 00:39:22,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the Bois de Boulogne?</font>

423
00:39:22,373 --> 00:39:25,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should be safe in this park
for a few minutes.</font>

424
00:39:41,992 --> 00:39:45,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your police don't patrol this park.</font>

425
00:40:39,283 --> 00:40:40,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay here.</font>

426
00:40:42,219 --> 00:40:43,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">Police.</font>

427
00:40:44,955 --> 00:40:46,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you want?</font>

428
00:41:01,104 --> 00:41:03,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fifty euros for all your stuff.</font>

429
00:41:05,408 --> 00:41:07,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go and get something to eat.</font>

430
00:41:27,664 --> 00:41:29,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did it occur to you
that could be dangerous?</font>

431
00:41:29,899 --> 00:41:33,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. And now we have
a place to think.</font>

432
00:41:33,603 --> 00:41:35,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any ideas, professor?</font>

433
00:41:36,506 --> 00:41:40,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">You could've just handed me
a piece of a UFO from Area 51.</font>

434
00:41:42,512 --> 00:41:44,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">"What's the next step?"</font>

435
00:41:44,781 --> 00:41:46,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">With him, it's always:</font>

436
00:41:46,616 --> 00:41:49,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Sophie, what's the next step?"</font>

437
00:41:50,453 --> 00:41:51,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">Puzzles.</font>

438
00:41:51,988 --> 00:41:53,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">Codes.</font>

439
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:55,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">A treasure hunt.</font>

440
00:41:59,896 --> 00:42:01,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">To find his killer.</font>

441
00:42:05,435 --> 00:42:08,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe there is something
about this Priory of Sion.</font>

442
00:42:09,038 --> 00:42:10,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope not.</font>

443
00:42:10,306 --> 00:42:15,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any Priory story ends in bloodshed.
They were butchered by the Church.</font>

444
00:42:15,478 --> 00:42:18,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">It all started over a thousand
years ago when a French king...</font>

445
00:42:18,848 --> 00:42:21,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">conquered the holy city
of Jerusalem.</font>

446

<font color="#FFFFFF">This crusade, one of the most
massive and sweeping in history...</font>

447
00:42:24,988 --> 00:42:28,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">was actually orchestrated
by a secret brotherhood...</font>

448

<font color="#FFFFFF">the Priory of Sion...</font>

449
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:34,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">and their military arm,
the Knights Templar.</font>

450
00:42:34,764 --> 00:42:37,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the Templars were created
to protect the Holy Land.</font>

451
00:42:38,034 --> 00:42:42,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was a cover to hide their
true goal, according to this myth.</font>

452
00:42:42,505 --> 00:42:45,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">Supposedly the invasion
was to find an artifact...</font>

453
00:42:45,909 --> 00:42:47,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">lost since the time of Christ.</font>

454
00:42:47,944 --> 00:42:52,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">An artifact, it was said,
the Church would kill to possess.</font>

455
00:42:52,282 --> 00:42:54,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did they find it,
this buried treasure?</font>

456
00:42:56,085 --> 00:42:57,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put it this way:</font>

457
00:42:57,554 --> 00:43:00,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">One day the Templars
simply stopped searching.</font>

458
00:43:00,657 --> 00:43:04,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">They quit the Holy Land
and traveled directly to Rome.</font>

459
00:43:04,327 --> 00:43:06,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whether they blackmailed
the papacy...</font>

460
00:43:06,396 --> 00:43:08,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">or the Church bought their silence,
no one knows.</font>

461
00:43:09,032 --> 00:43:13,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it is a fact the papacy
declared these Priory knights...</font>

462
00:43:13,603 --> 00:43:17,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">these Knights Templar,
of limitless power.</font>

463
00:43:17,907 --> 00:43:21,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">By the 1300s, the Templars
had grown too powerful.</font>

464
00:43:21,444 --> 00:43:22,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">Too threatening.</font>

465
00:43:23,212 --> 00:43:25,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">So the Vatican
issued secret orders...</font>

466
00:43:25,481 --> 00:43:28,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">to be opened simultaneously
all across Europe.</font>

467
00:43:29,152 --> 00:43:33,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Pope had declared the
Knights Templar Satan worshipers...</font>

468
00:43:33,389 --> 00:43:37,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">and said God had charged him with
cleansing the earth of these heretics.</font>

469
00:43:38,127 --> 00:43:40,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">The plan went off like clockwork.</font>

470
00:43:40,763 --> 00:43:43,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Templars
were all but exterminated.</font>

471
00:43:43,933 --> 00:43:48,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">The date was October 13th, 1307.
A Friday.</font>

472
00:43:48,371 --> 00:43:50,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">Friday the 13th.</font>

473
00:43:50,506 --> 00:43:53,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Pope sent troops
to claim the Priory's treasure...</font>

474
00:43:53,743 --> 00:43:55,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">but they found nothing.</font>

475
00:43:55,545 --> 00:43:58,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">The few surviving
Knights of the Priory had vanished...</font>

476
00:43:58,981 --> 00:44:01,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the search for their
sacred artifact began again.</font>

477
00:44:02,017 --> 00:44:06,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">What artifact? I've never
heard about any of this.</font>

478
00:44:06,388 --> 00:44:07,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, you have.</font>

479
00:44:08,256 --> 00:44:10,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">Almost everyone on earth has.</font>

480
00:44:11,159 --> 00:44:14,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just know it as the Holy Grail.</font>

481
00:44:19,768 --> 00:44:23,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, Sauniere thought he knew
the location of the Holy Grail?</font>

482
00:44:24,306 --> 00:44:26,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe more than that.</font>

483
00:44:26,408 --> 00:44:30,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">This cross and the flower,
this could be very old. But look.</font>

484
00:44:30,512 --> 00:44:35,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">This metal here underneath is much
newer, and there's a modern ID stamp.</font>

485
00:44:35,951 --> 00:44:37,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Haxo 24."</font>

486
00:44:39,788 --> 00:44:43,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">And these dots.
These dots are read by a laser.</font>

487
00:44:43,358 --> 00:44:47,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is more than a pendant.
This is a key your grandfather left you.</font>

488
00:44:47,429 --> 00:44:49,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">He left us, professor.</font>

489
00:44:51,299 --> 00:44:55,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">And vingt-quatre Haxo,
it's not an ID stamp.</font>

490
00:44:56,304 --> 00:44:58,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a street address.</font>

491
00:45:03,045 --> 00:45:04,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is Jacques Sauniere.</font>

492
00:45:05,013 --> 00:45:07,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please leave a message
after the tone.</font>

493
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:10,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, Monsieur Sauniere,
pick up the phone.</font>

494
00:45:11,186 --> 00:45:12,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is Sandrine Bieil.</font>

495
00:45:12,921 --> 00:45:15,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have called the list.</font>

496
00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:17,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">I fear the other guardians are dead.</font>

497
00:45:18,093 --> 00:45:19,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">The lie has been told.</font>

498
00:45:20,362 --> 00:45:22,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">The floor panel has been broken.</font>

499
00:45:22,497 --> 00:45:25,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, monsieur, pick up the phone.
I beg you.</font>

500
00:45:26,101 --> 00:45:28,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">Job 38, verse 11.</font>

501
00:45:29,738 --> 00:45:31,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know it, Sister?</font>

502
00:45:33,475 --> 00:45:35,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">Job 38:11.</font>

503
00:45:36,878 --> 00:45:39,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hitherto shalt thou come...</font>

504
00:45:39,981 --> 00:45:41,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">but no further.</font>

505
00:45:41,883 --> 00:45:43,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">"But no further."</font>

506
00:45:47,422 --> 00:45:49,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you mock me?</font>

507
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:54,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is the keystone?</font>

508
00:45:55,330 --> 00:45:57,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do not know.</font>

509
00:45:58,100 --> 00:45:59,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

510
00:46:01,536 --> 00:46:04,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are a sister of the Church...</font>

511
00:46:06,241 --> 00:46:09,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">and yet you serve them:
The Priory.</font>

512
00:46:09,845 --> 00:46:13,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus had but one true message.
That...</font>

513
00:46:34,069 --> 00:46:36,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come, you saints of God.</font>

514
00:46:37,706 --> 00:46:40,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hasten, angels of the Lord.</font>

515
00:46:41,076 --> 00:46:43,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">To receive her soul.</font>

516
00:46:44,279 --> 00:46:48,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">And bring her to the sight
of the Almighty.</font>

517
00:46:52,788 --> 00:46:57,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</font>

518
00:47:28,622 --> 00:47:30,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome, bishop.</font>

519
00:47:33,627 --> 00:47:34,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">May Christ be with you.</font>

520
00:47:35,029 --> 00:47:36,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">And also with you.</font>

521
00:47:37,198 --> 00:47:39,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's been too long, Manuel.</font>

522
00:47:41,368 --> 00:47:43,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw your press conference.</font>

523
00:47:43,604 --> 00:47:45,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very priestly.</font>

524
00:47:45,206 --> 00:47:46,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">Vultures.</font>

525
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:50,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you need a good cover
to fly into Italy these days.</font>

526
00:47:53,414 --> 00:47:55,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">So how are things in Rome?</font>

527
00:47:56,417 --> 00:47:57,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">We serve at his pleasure.</font>

528
00:48:00,054 --> 00:48:02,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">Today is today.</font>

529
00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:05,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">But there are many tomorrows.</font>

530
00:48:08,229 --> 00:48:09,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">Vatican cellars.</font>

531
00:48:10,531 --> 00:48:12,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">1976.</font>

532
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:16,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seventy-six, a year of independence.
How fitting.</font>

533
00:48:19,273 --> 00:48:21,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you'd like it.</font>

534
00:48:22,943 --> 00:48:24,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll fetch the others.</font>

535
00:48:44,765 --> 00:48:46,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome, bishop.</font>

536
00:48:50,204 --> 00:48:52,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">This council is convened.</font>

537
00:49:00,748 --> 00:49:04,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our words shall never
pass these walls.</font>

538
00:49:11,191 --> 00:49:12,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">What business, say you?</font>

539
00:49:14,895 --> 00:49:16,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">As you know, my request for funds...</font>

540
00:49:17,131 --> 00:49:21,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, 20 million euro
in untraceable bearer bonds.</font>

541
00:49:21,602 --> 00:49:24,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">A tad more than petty cash.
Wouldn't you say, bishop?</font>

542
00:49:24,972 --> 00:49:28,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">The endeavor is complex.
Freedom has a high cost.</font>

543
00:49:28,442 --> 00:49:30,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, of course, you will deliver us.</font>

544
00:49:30,711 --> 00:49:33,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">How fortunate we are.</font>

545
00:49:33,314 --> 00:49:37,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">I only offer a route to the renewal
of faith for all men.</font>

546
00:49:38,152 --> 00:49:39,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">How humble.</font>

547
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:42,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our savior, Bishop Aringarosa.</font>

548
00:49:42,323 --> 00:49:44,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">Were we to grant your request...</font>

549
00:49:44,825 --> 00:49:48,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">when would
this mission commence?</font>

550
00:49:48,228 --> 00:49:49,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Actually, tonight.
- What?</font>

551
00:49:50,464 --> 00:49:52,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It has begun.
- We have not agreed.</font>

552
00:49:52,333 --> 00:49:53,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">How dare you presume to...</font>

553
00:49:54,068 --> 00:49:55,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do not presume, I act!</font>

554
00:49:56,003 --> 00:49:58,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Vatican's unwillingness
to support us...</font>

555
00:49:58,372 --> 00:49:59,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">is both impious and cowardly.</font>

556
00:50:00,174 --> 00:50:04,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blood is being spilled because true
Christian values lie in ruins. No more!</font>

557
00:50:04,945 --> 00:50:08,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">This council has forgotten
its very purpose.</font>

558
00:50:10,883 --> 00:50:12,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tonight...</font>

559
00:50:13,086 --> 00:50:15,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">the Grail will be destroyed.</font>

560
00:50:15,688 --> 00:50:19,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Priory's few remaining members
will be silenced.</font>

561
00:50:27,567 --> 00:50:31,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was contacted by a man
who calls himself only "the Teacher."</font>

562
00:50:32,171 --> 00:50:35,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">He knows a great deal
about this council.</font>

563
00:50:36,009 --> 00:50:38,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">And about the Priory.</font>

564
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two prostitutes identified
Langdon and Neveu...</font>

565
00:50:56,496 --> 00:50:58,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">getting into a taxi
in the Bois de Boulogne.</font>

566
00:51:13,379 --> 00:51:15,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because of your expertise?</font>

567
00:51:16,482 --> 00:51:17,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm sorry?
- About the Priory.</font>

568
00:51:18,151 --> 00:51:20,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think that's why
Sauniere sought you out?</font>

569
00:51:21,187 --> 00:51:24,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can think of dozens of scholars
who know a lot more about it.</font>

570
00:51:24,490 --> 00:51:28,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, I didn't think
he liked me very much.</font>

571
00:51:29,228 --> 00:51:32,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once made a joke at my expense.
Got a big laugh out of it.</font>

572
00:51:32,865 --> 00:51:34,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">What was it?</font>

573
00:51:47,447 --> 00:51:49,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">How may I help you?</font>

574
00:51:55,121 --> 00:51:57,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">The door to the right, please.</font>

575
00:52:08,334 --> 00:52:10,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was quite a performance.</font>

576
00:52:12,672 --> 00:52:15,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">The little shit should know better
than to play politics with me.</font>

577
00:52:21,114 --> 00:52:23,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know I got in front of you,
old friend.</font>

578
00:52:25,418 --> 00:52:27,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did what I thought was best.</font>

579
00:52:34,994 --> 00:52:36,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">So...</font>

580
00:52:36,729 --> 00:52:37,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">now what?</font>

581
00:52:39,932 --> 00:52:42,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now we wait for the Teacher's call.</font>

582
00:52:54,947 --> 00:52:57,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good evening. I am Andre Vernet,
the night manager.</font>

583
00:52:59,118 --> 00:53:02,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">I take it this is your first visit
to our establishment?</font>

584
00:53:03,556 --> 00:53:04,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

585
00:53:05,458 --> 00:53:06,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">Understood.</font>

586
00:53:07,527 --> 00:53:09,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keys are often passed on
and first-time users...</font>

587
00:53:10,096 --> 00:53:12,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">are sometimes
uncertain of protocol.</font>

588
00:53:14,533 --> 00:53:17,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keys are essentially
numbered Swiss accounts.</font>

589
00:53:18,970 --> 00:53:21,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Often willed through generations.</font>

590
00:53:24,442 --> 00:53:26,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it yours, mademoiselle?</font>

591
00:53:29,014 --> 00:53:32,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">The shortest safety-deposit-box
lease is 50 years.</font>

592
00:53:33,018 --> 00:53:35,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what's your longest account?</font>

593
00:53:35,287 --> 00:53:36,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quite a bit longer.</font>

594
00:53:37,322 --> 00:53:39,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">Technologies change,
keys are updated.</font>

595
00:53:40,292 --> 00:53:44,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">But our accounts date back
to the beginning of banking itself.</font>

596
00:53:49,201 --> 00:53:50,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once the computer
confirms your key...</font>

597
00:53:51,036 --> 00:53:54,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">enter your account number
and your box is retrieved.</font>

598
00:53:54,873 --> 00:53:57,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">The room is yours,
as long as you like.</font>

599
00:54:02,414 --> 00:54:05,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if I lost track
of my account number?</font>

600
00:54:06,184 --> 00:54:07,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">How might I recover it?</font>

601
00:54:09,921 --> 00:54:12,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm afraid each key is paired
with a 10-digit number...</font>

602
00:54:12,691 --> 00:54:14,716

disables the system.</font>

605

- Ten.</font>

Fibonacci sequence.</font>

607

608
00:54:37,449 --> 00:54:38,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unscrambled.</font>

609
00:54:39,451 --> 00:54:41,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's your key.</font>

610
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:49,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">Funny, I don't even like history.</font>

611
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:57,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never seen much good come
from looking to the past.</font>

612
00:55:04,643 --> 00:55:06,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">Moment of truth.</font>

613
00:55:50,789 --> 00:55:53,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">My God. I don't believe this.</font>

614
00:55:53,758 --> 00:55:54,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">A rose.</font>

615
00:55:59,764 --> 00:56:01,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">The rose was a symbol
for the Holy Grail.</font>

616
00:56:04,469 --> 00:56:06,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forgive the intrusion.</font>

617
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:09,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm afraid the police arrived
more quickly than I anticipated.</font>

618
00:56:10,775 --> 00:56:12,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must follow me, please.</font>

619
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:14,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">For your own safety.</font>

620
00:56:14,479 --> 00:56:16,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">You knew they were coming?</font>

621
00:56:16,281 --> 00:56:19,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">My guard alerted me to your status
when you arrived.</font>

622
00:56:19,216 --> 00:56:22,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yours is one of our oldest
and highest-level accounts.</font>

625
00:56:26,790 --> 00:56:30,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you would step inside, please.
Time is of the essence.</font>

626
00:56:33,163 --> 00:56:34,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">In there?</font>

627
00:56:49,613 --> 00:56:51,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, is there a problem?</font>

628
00:56:51,615 --> 00:56:54,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good evening, sir. Police.</font>

629
00:56:54,685 --> 00:56:58,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just drive from here to Zurich.
Not French, English?</font>

630
00:56:59,123 --> 00:57:00,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">- English?
- Yes.</font>

631
00:57:01,692 --> 00:57:04,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are looking for two criminals.</font>

632
00:57:05,529 --> 00:57:08,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">You came to the right place.
They're all criminals here.</font>

633
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:12,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you mind opening the hold?</font>

634
00:57:13,070 --> 00:57:16,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please. You think they trust us,
the wages I get paid?</font>

635
00:57:16,807 --> 00:57:18,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have keys
to your own truck?</font>

636
00:57:18,876 --> 00:57:21,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's armored.
Keys get sent to the destination.</font>

637
00:57:21,779 --> 00:57:23,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">You mind? I'm on a schedule here.</font>

638
00:57:27,384 --> 00:57:31,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">And do all the drivers wear a Rolex?</font>

639
00:57:32,289 --> 00:57:33,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

640
00:57:35,793 --> 00:57:37,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">This piece of shit.</font>

641
00:57:37,528 --> 00:57:39,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forty euros in Barbes.</font>

642
00:57:39,496 --> 00:57:40,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yours for 35.</font>

643
00:57:41,265 --> 00:57:42,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no.</font>

644
00:57:42,433 --> 00:57:44,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thirty.
- No. It's okay, it's okay.</font>

645
00:57:44,401 --> 00:57:45,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, 30, eh?</font>

646
00:57:45,836 --> 00:57:47,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">I said, no!</font>

647
00:57:47,738 --> 00:57:48,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">Move along!</font>

648
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:03,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now we wait.</font>

649
00:58:03,587 --> 00:58:06,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Teacher will call and tell me
where to deliver the money.</font>

650
00:58:06,390 --> 00:58:09,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have put tremendous faith
in this Teacher of yours.</font>

651
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:14,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I have. And I have given him
an angel to do his will.</font>

652
00:58:14,731 --> 00:58:18,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">For surely there is no better
soldier for God than my Silas.</font>

653
00:58:19,069 --> 00:58:22,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">I firmly resolve, with the help of
thy grace, to confess my sins...</font>

654
00:58:36,987 --> 00:58:39,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">to do penance
and to amend my life.</font>

655
00:58:39,990 --> 00:58:40,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">Amen.</font>

656
00:59:01,245 --> 00:59:03,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">I chastise my body.</font>

657
00:59:19,663 --> 00:59:21,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Holy Grail.</font>

658
00:59:22,065 --> 00:59:26,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">A magic cup.
The source of God's power on earth.</font>

659
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:28,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's nonsense.</font>

660
00:59:29,372 --> 00:59:31,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't believe in God.</font>

661
00:59:32,174 --> 00:59:33,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

662
00:59:34,110 --> 00:59:39,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't believe in some magic
from the sky.</font>

663
00:59:39,782 --> 00:59:41,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just people.</font>

664
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:44,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes that they can be kind.</font>

665
00:59:45,421 --> 00:59:46,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's enough?</font>

666
00:59:47,023 --> 00:59:50,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I think it has to be.
I think it's all we have.</font>

667
00:59:52,962 --> 00:59:55,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you a God-fearing man,
professor?</font>

668
00:59:56,632 --> 00:59:58,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was raised a Catholic.</font>

669
00:59:59,135 --> 01:00:01,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's not really an answer.</font>

670
01:00:03,573 --> 01:00:05,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor, are you okay?</font>

671
01:00:06,676 --> 01:00:08,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go ahead, open it.</font>

672
01:00:09,078 --> 01:00:10,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on.</font>

673
01:00:17,219 --> 01:00:18,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">A cryptex.</font>

674
01:00:19,889 --> 01:00:22,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">They are used to keep secrets.</font>

675
01:00:23,159 --> 01:00:25,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's da Vinci's design.</font>

676
01:00:25,928 --> 01:00:29,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">You write the information
on a papyrus scroll...</font>

677
01:00:29,432 --> 01:00:34,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">which is then rolled around
a thin glass vial of vinegar.</font>

678
01:00:34,737 --> 01:00:37,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you force it open, the vial breaks...</font>

679
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:40,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">vinegar dissolves papyrus...</font>

680
01:00:42,578 --> 01:00:45,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">and your secret is lost forever.</font>

681
01:00:45,548 --> 01:00:47,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">The only way
to access the information...</font>

682
01:00:47,783 --> 01:00:50,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">is to spell out the password...</font>

683
01:00:50,353 --> 01:00:53,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">with these five dials,
each with 26 letters.</font>

684
01:00:54,724 --> 01:00:58,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's 12 million possibilities.</font>

685
01:00:59,095 --> 01:01:02,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never met a girl
who knew that much about a cryptex.</font>

686
01:01:03,933 --> 01:01:06,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sauniere made one for me once.</font>

687
01:01:14,143 --> 01:01:17,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">My grandfather gave me a wagon.</font>

688
01:01:19,915 --> 01:01:22,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">This clearly is not the Holy Grail.</font>

689
01:01:26,088 --> 01:01:27,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

690
01:01:27,523 --> 01:01:28,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, you're not all right.</font>

691
01:01:32,361 --> 01:01:34,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">May I try something?</font>

692
01:01:34,497 --> 01:01:36,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know why it works.</font>

693
01:01:36,999 --> 01:01:40,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">My mother used to do it
when I was scared, I think.</font>

694
01:01:40,936 --> 01:01:42,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think?</font>

695
01:01:43,005 --> 01:01:44,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

696
01:01:56,118 --> 01:01:57,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Feeling better, Sophie?</font>

697
01:02:09,799 --> 01:02:14,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">My parents died in a car crash
with my brother.</font>

698
01:02:15,571 --> 01:02:16,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was 4.</font>

699
01:02:18,774 --> 01:02:20,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

700
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:23,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was many years ago.</font>

701
01:02:39,094 --> 01:02:40,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">Better?</font>

702
01:02:43,131 --> 01:02:44,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

703
01:02:44,899 --> 01:02:46,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

704
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:14,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">Twenty years waiting
for someone to come for that box...</font>

705
01:03:14,963 --> 01:03:17,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">and now it's you two murderers.
Bring it to me.</font>

706
01:03:18,299 --> 01:03:19,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know what
you're talking about.</font>

707
01:03:21,202 --> 01:03:23,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right! Okay!</font>

708
01:03:23,838 --> 01:03:24,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right now!</font>

709
01:03:35,316 --> 01:03:36,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">Step back!</font>

710
01:03:40,255 --> 01:03:42,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one will lose sleep
over a couple on a killing spree.</font>

711
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:47,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Turn around.</font>

712
01:03:48,596 --> 01:03:49,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">Turn around!</font>

713
01:03:50,331 --> 01:03:52,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">You too, mademoiselle.</font>

714
01:04:14,622 --> 01:04:16,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sophie!</font>

715
01:04:16,591 --> 01:04:17,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get in the truck!</font>

716
01:04:18,793 --> 01:04:20,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll drive! Hurry!</font>

717
01:04:58,299 --> 01:05:01,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Better?
- Always, if I got too nervous...</font>

718
01:05:01,703 --> 01:05:04,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had to put my head out
of the window not to be sick.</font>

719
01:05:05,473 --> 01:05:08,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sauniere used to say
I was like a dog.</font>

720
01:05:09,444 --> 01:05:13,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">A cute dog. You know, a little dog.</font>

721
01:05:22,891 --> 01:05:26,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened between you
and your grandfather, Sophie?</font>

722
01:05:28,930 --> 01:05:32,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've jammed my shoulder,
I've been shot at, I'm bleeding.</font>

723
01:05:33,001 --> 01:05:34,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to know.</font>

724
01:05:34,768 --> 01:05:38,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">You say he raised you,
but you two don't talk anymore.</font>

725
01:05:38,438 --> 01:05:40,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">You call him by his last name.</font>

726
01:05:40,674 --> 01:05:43,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">You say you hate history.</font>

727
01:05:43,443 --> 01:05:45,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody hates history.
They hate their own histories.</font>

728
01:05:45,913 --> 01:05:47,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">So now you're a psychologist too?</font>

729
01:05:48,282 --> 01:05:52,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if Sauniere had started
to groom you for the Priory?</font>

730
01:05:52,686 --> 01:05:54,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you mean, groom me?</font>

731
01:05:54,621 --> 01:05:57,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your grandfather gave you puzzles
and cryptex as a child.</font>

732
01:05:58,725 --> 01:06:02,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say Sauniere was hoping one day
you would join him in the Priory.</font>

733
01:06:03,163 --> 01:06:05,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">Still, years later,
when he imagines...</font>

734
01:06:06,099 --> 01:06:08,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">the Grail is in danger,
he reaches out to you.</font>

735
01:06:09,102 --> 01:06:13,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you are saying all this is real?
The Priory, the Holy Grail?</font>

736
01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:16,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've been dragged into a world
of people who think this stuff is real.</font>

737
01:06:16,677 --> 01:06:18,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Real enough to kill for.
- Who?</font>

738
01:06:25,018 --> 01:06:27,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm out of my field here.</font>

739
01:06:29,990 --> 01:06:34,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do know a Grail historian,
absolutely obsessed with Priory myth.</font>

740
01:06:34,861 --> 01:06:37,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">An Englishman,
lives here in France.</font>

741
01:06:38,332 --> 01:06:39,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you trust this man?</font>

742
01:06:41,068 --> 01:06:42,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope you can.</font>

743
01:06:48,709 --> 01:06:50,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">Vernet, Andre.</font>

744
01:06:52,212 --> 01:06:55,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">It seems you're not a driver at all.</font>

745
01:06:56,883 --> 01:07:01,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Apparently, you lost your tongue
along with your truck.</font>

746
01:07:04,891 --> 01:07:09,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aiding and abetting
two murder suspects.</font>

747
01:07:09,262 --> 01:07:11,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">That carries jail time.</font>

748
01:07:12,232 --> 01:07:13,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">Speak to my lawyer.</font>

749
01:07:15,669 --> 01:07:22,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">All this confusion, violence,
vanishing property...</font>

750
01:07:22,809 --> 01:07:29,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">It might get around that your bank is
less than ideal, don't you think?</font>

751
01:07:31,184 --> 01:07:33,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think you're in pain now,
Andre Vernet?</font>

752
01:07:34,287 --> 01:07:38,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">My cause is worth your life.
Understand?</font>

753
01:07:42,629 --> 01:07:44,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you want?</font>

754
01:07:44,531 --> 01:07:49,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your truck carries a homing device.
Activate it.</font>

755
01:07:57,711 --> 01:08:00,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please wait.
I'll see if he's available.</font>

756
01:08:00,614 --> 01:08:02,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's on the wrong side.</font>

757
01:08:02,449 --> 01:08:04,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leigh likes all things to be English,
including his cars.</font>

758
01:08:05,152 --> 01:08:08,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robert! Do I owe you money?</font>

759
01:08:09,156 --> 01:08:11,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leigh, my friend...</font>

760
01:08:12,225 --> 01:08:15,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">care to open up
for an old colleague?</font>

761
01:08:15,695 --> 01:08:17,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Of course.
- Thank you.</font>

762
01:08:17,764 --> 01:08:20,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">But first, a test of honor.</font>

763
01:08:20,767 --> 01:08:22,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three questions.</font>

764
01:08:25,772 --> 01:08:26,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fire away.</font>

765
01:08:27,174 --> 01:08:28,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your first:</font>

766
01:08:28,809 --> 01:08:31,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shall I serve coffee or tea?</font>

767
01:08:32,345 --> 01:08:33,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tea, of course.</font>

768
01:08:33,914 --> 01:08:34,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excellent.</font>

769
01:08:35,182 --> 01:08:37,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Milk or lemon?</font>

770
01:08:38,518 --> 01:08:39,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">Milk?</font>

771
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:43,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">That would depend on the tea.</font>

772
01:08:43,456 --> 01:08:44,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">Correct.</font>

773
01:08:45,424 --> 01:08:49,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now the third
and most grave of inquiries:</font>

774
01:08:49,829 --> 01:08:55,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">In which year did a Harvard sculler
outrow an Oxford man at Henley?</font>

775
01:09:02,675 --> 01:09:06,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">Surely such a travesty
has never occurred.</font>

776
01:09:07,046 --> 01:09:08,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your heart is true.</font>

777
01:09:09,782 --> 01:09:11,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">You may pass.</font>

778
01:09:12,985 --> 01:09:15,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome to Chateau Villette.</font>

779
01:09:19,892 --> 01:09:22,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leigh Teabing has spent
his entire life...</font>

780
01:09:23,095 --> 01:09:25,928
<font color="#FFFFFF">studying the Grail.
That thing is one hot tamale.</font>

781
01:09:26,132 --> 01:09:27,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry?</font>

782
01:09:27,733 --> 01:09:30,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">The cryptex, it's a hot coal.</font>

783
01:09:32,805 --> 01:09:33,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">A hot potato?</font>

784
01:09:35,708 --> 01:09:39,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you want to keep our chest
close to our cards, yes?</font>

785
01:09:41,514 --> 01:09:43,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very close.</font>

786
01:10:04,603 --> 01:10:07,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">The truck's signal is coming online.</font>

787
01:10:07,439 --> 01:10:08,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's about time.</font>

788
01:10:12,611 --> 01:10:14,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">Locked on and tracking, sir.</font>

789
01:10:17,283 --> 01:10:20,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very good. Tell Collet not to move in
until I get there.</font>

790
01:10:21,020 --> 01:10:25,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Attention! All of Collet's units
to Chateau Villette.</font>

791
01:10:26,458 --> 01:10:29,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">The suspects Neveu and Langdon
are likely at that location.</font>

792
01:10:46,278 --> 01:10:47,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aringarosa.</font>

793
01:10:58,557 --> 01:11:01,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">I still don't know why
he put you into this...</font>

794
01:11:02,294 --> 01:11:04,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'm sorry.</font>

795
01:11:09,301 --> 01:11:10,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">But...</font>

796
01:11:11,303 --> 01:11:13,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm also very glad.</font>

797
01:11:31,390 --> 01:11:34,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are requested
to make yourself at home.</font>

798
01:11:42,368 --> 01:11:43,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robert!</font>

799
01:11:44,636 --> 01:11:47,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you travel with a maiden,
it seems.</font>

800
01:11:47,405 --> 01:11:50,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir Leigh Teabing,
may I present Miss Sophie Neveu.</font>

801
01:11:50,842 --> 01:11:52,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sophie, Sir Leigh Teabing.</font>

802
01:11:53,177 --> 01:11:56,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's an honor to welcome you...</font>

803
01:11:57,615 --> 01:11:59,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">even though it's late.</font>

804
01:11:59,984 --> 01:12:03,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you for having us.
I realize it's quite late.</font>

805
01:12:05,089 --> 01:12:08,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">So late, mademoiselle,
it's almost early.</font>

806
01:12:10,728 --> 01:12:12,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">What a lovely smile you have.</font>

807
01:12:14,465 --> 01:12:15,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Earl Grey?</font>

808
01:12:16,401 --> 01:12:17,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lemon.</font>

809
01:12:18,202 --> 01:12:19,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">Correct.</font>

810
01:12:40,058 --> 01:12:42,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chateau Villette. Yes.</font>

811
01:12:48,399 --> 01:12:50,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- Oh, you must.</font>

812
01:12:50,301 --> 01:12:53,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remy is from Lyons,
but nevertheless...</font>

813
01:12:53,237 --> 01:12:54,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">he is fantastic with sauces.</font>

814
01:12:54,906 --> 01:12:57,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thank you.
- No, I can't.</font>

815
01:13:01,946 --> 01:13:04,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">A dramatic late-night arrival.</font>

816
01:13:05,383 --> 01:13:07,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mention of life and death.</font>

817
01:13:08,820 --> 01:13:11,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">What can an old cripple
do for you, Robert?</font>

818
01:13:12,423 --> 01:13:16,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">We wanna talk about
the Priory of Sion.</font>

819
01:13:16,561 --> 01:13:17,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">The keepers?</font>

820
01:13:18,730 --> 01:13:20,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">The secret war?</font>

821
01:13:20,264 --> 01:13:22,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry for all the mystery.</font>

822
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leigh, I'm into something here
that I cannot understand.</font>

823
01:13:26,437 --> 01:13:27,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">You?</font>

824
01:13:28,373 --> 01:13:31,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Really?
- Not without your help.</font>

825
01:13:32,176 --> 01:13:35,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">Playing to my vanity, Robert.
You should be ashamed.</font>

826
01:13:35,446 --> 01:13:36,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not if it works.</font>

827
01:13:39,250 --> 01:13:41,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are always four:</font>

828
01:13:42,220 --> 01:13:45,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Grand Master
and the three senechaux...</font>

829
01:13:45,556 --> 01:13:48,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">make up the primary
guardians of the Grail.</font>

830
01:13:50,895 --> 01:13:52,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, Remy.
That'll be all for now.</font>

831
01:13:59,437 --> 01:14:02,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Priory's members
span our very globe itself.</font>

832
01:14:02,974 --> 01:14:07,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">Philippe de Cherisey
exposed that as a hoax in 1967.</font>

833
01:14:07,612 --> 01:14:09,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that is what
they want you to believe.</font>

834
01:14:10,481 --> 01:14:13,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Priory is charged
with a single task:</font>

835
01:14:13,484 --> 01:14:16,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">To protect the greatest secret
in modern history.</font>

836
01:14:17,021 --> 01:14:19,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">The source of God's power
on earth.</font>

837
01:14:19,724 --> 01:14:21,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, that's a common
misunderstanding.</font>

838
01:14:21,526 --> 01:14:26,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Priory protects the source
of the Church's power on earth:</font>

839
01:14:27,165 --> 01:14:28,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Holy Grail.</font>

840
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't understand.</font>

841
01:14:30,835 --> 01:14:34,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">What power? Some magic dishes?</font>

842
01:14:35,706 --> 01:14:39,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robert. Has he been telling you
that the Holy Grail is a cup?</font>

843
01:14:42,447 --> 01:14:44,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">To understand the Holy Grail,
my dear...</font>

844
01:14:44,415 --> 01:14:47,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">you must first understand
the Holy Bible.</font>

845
01:15:03,633 --> 01:15:07,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Good Book did not arrive
by facsimile from heaven.</font>

846
01:15:08,205 --> 01:15:12,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Bible as we know it</font>

847
01:15:12,909 --> 01:15:14,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">The pagan emperor Constantine.</font>

848
01:15:15,078 --> 01:15:17,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought Constantine
was a Christian.</font>

849
01:15:17,414 --> 01:15:20,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, hardly, no.
He was a lifelong pagan...</font>

850
01:15:20,550 --> 01:15:23,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">who was baptized
on his deathbed.</font>

851
01:15:23,386 --> 01:15:26,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Constantine was Rome's
supreme holy man.</font>

852
01:15:27,057 --> 01:15:28,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">From time immemorial...</font>

853
01:15:28,758 --> 01:15:33,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">his people had worshiped a balance
between nature's male deities...</font>

854
01:15:33,430 --> 01:15:36,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the goddess,
or sacred feminine.</font>

855
01:15:37,734 --> 01:15:41,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">But a growing religious turmoil
was gripping Rome.</font>

856
01:15:41,938 --> 01:15:43,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three centuries earlier...</font>

857
01:15:44,007 --> 01:15:46,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">a young Jew named Jesus
had come along...</font>

858
01:15:47,177 --> 01:15:49,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">preaching love and a single God.</font>

859
01:15:49,679 --> 01:15:52,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Centuries after his crucifixion...</font>

860
01:15:53,283 --> 01:15:56,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">Christ's followers
had grown exponentially...</font>

861
01:15:56,253 --> 01:15:58,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">and had started a religious war
against the pagans.</font>

862
01:16:03,894 --> 01:16:07,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or did the pagans commence war
against the Christians?</font>

863
01:16:07,964 --> 01:16:11,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leigh, we can't be sure who began
the atrocities in that period.</font>

864
01:16:11,401 --> 01:16:14,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can at least agree that the
conflict grew to such proportions...</font>

865
01:16:14,538 --> 01:16:17,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">that it threatened
to tear Rome in two.</font>

866
01:16:17,307 --> 01:16:20,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">So Constantine may have been
a lifelong pagan...</font>

867
01:16:20,777 --> 01:16:22,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">but he was also a pragmatist.</font>

868
01:16:22,812 --> 01:16:24,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">And in 325 anno Domini...</font>

869
01:16:25,148 --> 01:16:30,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">he decided to unify Rome under
a single religion, Christianity.</font>

870
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:34,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">Christianity was on the rise.
He didn't want his empire torn apart.</font>

871
01:16:34,824 --> 01:16:38,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">And to strengthen this new
Christian tradition...</font>

872
01:16:38,261 --> 01:16:40,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">Constantine held
a famous ecumenical gathering...</font>

873
01:16:40,730 --> 01:16:43,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">known as the Council of Nicaea.</font>

874
01:16:43,767 --> 01:16:45,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">And at this council...</font>

875
01:16:45,435 --> 01:16:50,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">the many sects of Christianity
debated and voted on, well...</font>

876
01:16:50,540 --> 01:16:54,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">everything, from the acceptance
and rejection of specific gospels...</font>

877
01:16:54,644 --> 01:16:56,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">to the date for Easter...</font>

878
01:16:56,379 --> 01:16:59,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">to the administering
of the sacraments, and of course...</font>

879
01:16:59,649 --> 01:17:01,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">the immortality of Jesus.</font>

880
01:17:02,185 --> 01:17:03,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't follow.</font>

881
01:17:03,853 --> 01:17:06,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, ma chere,
until that moment in history...</font>

882
01:17:07,057 --> 01:17:11,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus was viewed by many of his
followers as a mighty prophet...</font>

883
01:17:11,861 --> 01:17:15,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">as a great and powerful man,
but a man nevertheless.</font>

884
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:18,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">A mortal man.</font>

885
01:17:19,135 --> 01:17:22,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some Christians held
that Jesus was mortal.</font>

886
01:17:22,439 --> 01:17:25,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some Christians believed
he was divine.</font>

887
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:26,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not the Son of God?</font>

888
01:17:26,843 --> 01:17:29,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not even his nephew twice removed.</font>

889
01:17:29,446 --> 01:17:33,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold on, you're saying
Jesus' divinity came from a vote.</font>

890
01:17:33,683 --> 01:17:36,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, remember, in those days,
gods were everywhere.</font>

891
01:17:36,953 --> 01:17:41,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">By infusing Jesus the man
with the divine magic...</font>

892
01:17:41,324 --> 01:17:44,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">by making him capable
of earthly miracles...</font>

893
01:17:45,028 --> 01:17:49,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">as well as his own resurrection,
Constantine turned him into a god...</font>

894
01:17:49,332 --> 01:17:51,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">but within the human world.</font>

895
01:17:51,735 --> 01:17:55,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he basically knocked the more
distant gods out of the game.</font>

896
01:17:55,304 --> 01:17:58,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">Constantine did not create
Jesus' divinity.</font>

897
01:17:58,974 --> 01:18:02,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">He simply sanctioned
an already widely held idea.</font>

898
01:18:03,145 --> 01:18:04,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Semantics.
- No, it's not semantics.</font>

899
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:07,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're interpreting facts
to support your own conclusions.</font>

900
01:18:08,183 --> 01:18:12,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">For many Christians, Jesus was
mortal one day and divine the next.</font>

901
01:18:13,155 --> 01:18:15,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">For some Christians,
his divinity was enhanced.</font>

902
01:18:15,391 --> 01:18:17,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">Absurd. There was a formal
announcement of his promotion.</font>

903
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:20,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">They couldn't even agree
on the Nicene Creed!</font>

904
01:18:20,229 --> 01:18:23,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me.
"Who is God, who is man?"</font>

905
01:18:28,003 --> 01:18:30,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many have been murdered
over this question?</font>

906
01:18:31,707 --> 01:18:34,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">As long as there has been
a one true God...</font>

907
01:18:34,843 --> 01:18:37,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">there has been killing
in his name.</font>

908
01:18:45,587 --> 01:18:48,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now let me show you the Grail.</font>

909
01:18:56,365 --> 01:18:59,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">This used to be the ballroom.</font>

910
01:18:59,635 --> 01:19:01,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have little occasion to dance
these days.</font>

911
01:19:02,304 --> 01:19:04,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">I trust you recognize
The Last Supper...</font>

912
01:19:05,541 --> 01:19:09,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">the great fresco by
Leonardo da Vinci.</font>

913
01:19:11,914 --> 01:19:14,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, my dear,
if you would close your eyes.</font>

914
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:16,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Leigh, save us the parlor tricks.</font>

915
01:19:17,186 --> 01:19:19,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">You asked for my help, I recall.</font>

916
01:19:19,722 --> 01:19:22,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Allow an old man his indulgences.</font>

917
01:19:26,662 --> 01:19:30,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, mademoiselle,
where is Jesus sitting?</font>

918
01:19:30,666 --> 01:19:32,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">- In the middle.
- Good.</font>

919
01:19:32,568 --> 01:19:35,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">He and his disciples
are breaking bread.</font>

920
01:19:35,604 --> 01:19:38,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what drink?</font>

921
01:19:38,373 --> 01:19:40,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wine. They drank wine.</font>

922
01:19:40,442 --> 01:19:42,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Splendid. And one final question:</font>

923
01:19:42,945 --> 01:19:45,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many wineglasses
are there on the table?</font>

924
01:19:47,349 --> 01:19:49,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">One? The Holy Grail?</font>

925
01:19:49,485 --> 01:19:50,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">Open your eyes.</font>

926
01:19:53,422 --> 01:19:55,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">No single cup.</font>

927
01:19:55,624 --> 01:19:56,852
<font color="#FFFFFF">No chalice.</font>

928
01:19:57,059 --> 01:19:59,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's a bit strange, isn't it?</font>

929
01:19:59,995 --> 01:20:03,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">Considering both the Bible
and standard Grail legend...</font>

930
01:20:03,332 --> 01:20:07,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">celebrate this moment as the
definitive arrival of the Holy Grail.</font>

931
01:20:10,372 --> 01:20:12,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, Robert,
you could be of help to us.</font>

932
01:20:13,108 --> 01:20:17,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you'd be so kind as to show us the
symbols for man and woman, please.</font>

933
01:20:17,212 --> 01:20:20,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">No balloon animals.
I can make a great duck.</font>

934
01:20:23,952 --> 01:20:28,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the original icon for male.
It's a rudimentary phallus.</font>

935
01:20:28,290 --> 01:20:30,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Quite to the point.
- Yes, indeed.</font>

936
01:20:30,626 --> 01:20:32,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is known as the blade.</font>

937
01:20:32,895 --> 01:20:34,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">It represents aggression
and manhood.</font>

938
01:20:34,963 --> 01:20:37,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a symbol still used today
in modern military uniforms.</font>

939
01:20:37,933 --> 01:20:41,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, the more penises you have, the
higher your rank. Boys will be boys.</font>

940
01:20:42,171 --> 01:20:46,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, as you would imagine, the
female symbol is its exact opposite.</font>

941
01:20:46,675 --> 01:20:48,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is called the chalice.</font>

942
01:20:48,310 --> 01:20:53,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the chalice resembles a cup
or vessel or, more importantly...</font>

943
01:20:53,315 --> 01:20:55,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">the shape of a woman's womb.</font>

944
01:20:56,685 --> 01:20:59,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, the Grail has never been a cup.</font>

945
01:20:59,854 --> 01:21:04,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is quite literally this ancient
symbol of womanhood.</font>

946
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:11,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">And in this case, a woman who
carried a secret so powerful...</font>

947
01:21:11,299 --> 01:21:15,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">that if revealed, it would devastate
the very foundations of Christianity.</font>

948
01:21:15,803 --> 01:21:17,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, please.</font>

949
01:21:17,271 --> 01:21:21,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're saying the Holy Grail
is a person? A woman?</font>

950
01:21:22,643 --> 01:21:26,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it turns out, she makes
an appearance right there.</font>

951
01:21:27,215 --> 01:21:28,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">But they are all men.</font>

952
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:30,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are they?</font>

953
01:21:30,384 --> 01:21:32,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about that figure
on the right hand of our Lord...</font>

954
01:21:32,987 --> 01:21:35,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">seated in the place of honor?</font>

955
01:21:36,524 --> 01:21:38,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Flowing red hair.</font>

956
01:21:39,493 --> 01:21:41,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">Folded feminine hands.</font>

957
01:21:42,964 --> 01:21:45,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hint of a bosom. No?</font>

958
01:21:50,872 --> 01:21:54,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's called scotoma.
The mind sees what it chooses to see.</font>

959
01:21:54,575 --> 01:21:55,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who is she?</font>

960
01:21:57,245 --> 01:21:59,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">My dear, that's Mary Magdalene.</font>

961
01:21:59,513 --> 01:22:00,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">The prostitute?</font>

962
01:22:01,515 --> 01:22:02,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was no such thing.</font>

963
01:22:03,384 --> 01:22:07,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Smeared by the Church
in 591 anno Domini, poor dear.</font>

964
01:22:10,424 --> 01:22:13,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mary Magdalene was Jesus' wife.</font>

965
01:22:20,268 --> 01:22:22,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is an old wives' tale.</font>

966
01:22:22,436 --> 01:22:23,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">The original one, in fact.</font>

967
01:22:24,071 --> 01:22:26,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's virtually no empirical proof.</font>

968
01:22:26,374 --> 01:22:29,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">He knows as well as I do
there's much evidence to support it.</font>

969
01:22:29,777 --> 01:22:31,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">Theories. There are theories.</font>

970
01:22:31,646 --> 01:22:34,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">Notice how Jesus and Mary
are clothed.</font>

971
01:22:36,217 --> 01:22:38,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mirror images of each other.</font>

972
01:22:38,452 --> 01:22:40,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">The mind sees
what it chooses to see.</font>

973
01:22:41,122 --> 01:22:45,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">And venturing into the even more
bizarre, notice how Jesus and Mary...</font>

974
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:49,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">appear to be joined at the hip and
are leaning away from each other...</font>

975
01:22:49,463 --> 01:22:54,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">as if to create a shape in the
negative space between them.</font>

976
01:22:55,036 --> 01:22:58,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leonardo gives us the chalice.</font>

977
01:23:00,908 --> 01:23:03,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. Oh, and Robert,
notice what happens...</font>

978
01:23:03,678 --> 01:23:06,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">when these two figures
change position.</font>

979
01:23:07,715 --> 01:23:10,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just because da Vinci painted it
doesn't make it true.</font>

980
01:23:11,185 --> 01:23:13,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. But history...</font>

981
01:23:13,487 --> 01:23:15,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">she does make it true.</font>

982
01:23:15,489 --> 01:23:18,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, listen to this. It's from
the Gospel according to Philip.</font>

983
01:23:18,926 --> 01:23:19,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">Philip?</font>

984
01:23:20,094 --> 01:23:22,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, it was rejected
at the Council of Nicaea...</font>

985
01:23:23,164 --> 01:23:25,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">along with any other gospels
that made...</font>

986
01:23:25,366 --> 01:23:27,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus appear human
and not divine.</font>

987
01:23:28,069 --> 01:23:32,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">"And the companion of the Savior
is Mary Magdalene.</font>

988
01:23:33,341 --> 01:23:37,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">Christ loved her more
than all the disciples...</font>

989
01:23:37,278 --> 01:23:39,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">and used to kiss her on the..."</font>

990
01:23:39,347 --> 01:23:41,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">But this says nothing of marriage.</font>

991
01:23:41,382 --> 01:23:44,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, actually...</font>

992
01:23:44,352 --> 01:23:45,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robert.</font>

993
01:23:45,953 --> 01:23:50,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, in those days, the word
"companion" literally meant "spouse."</font>

994
01:23:50,791 --> 01:23:55,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">And this is from the Gospel
of Mary Magdalene herself.</font>

995
01:23:55,429 --> 01:23:58,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">- She wrote a gospel?
- She may have.</font>

996
01:23:58,299 --> 01:24:01,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Robert, will you fight fair?
- She may have.</font>

997
01:24:01,435 --> 01:24:05,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">"And Peter said,
'Did he prefer her to us?'</font>

998
01:24:06,373 --> 01:24:07,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Levi answered:</font>

999
01:24:07,841 --> 01:24:11,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Peter, I see you contending
against a woman like an adversary.</font>

1000
01:24:12,145 --> 01:24:16,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">If the Savior made her worthy,
who are you, indeed, to reject her?'"</font>

1001
01:24:16,816 --> 01:24:21,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. And then, my dear, Jesus
goes on to tell Mary Magdalene...</font>

1002
01:24:21,488 --> 01:24:25,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">that it's up to her
to continue his Church.</font>

1003
01:24:26,426 --> 01:24:29,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mary Magdalene, not Peter.</font>

1004
01:24:29,929 --> 01:24:33,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Church was supposed
to be carried on by a woman.</font>

1005
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:38,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Few realize that Mary was descended
from kings, just as her husband was.</font>

1006
01:24:39,506 --> 01:24:44,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, my dear, the word
in French for Holy Grail.</font>

1007
01:24:46,179 --> 01:24:49,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">From the Middle English
"Sangreal"...</font>

1008
01:24:49,516 --> 01:24:52,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">of the original Arthurian legend.</font>

1009
01:24:52,285 --> 01:24:57,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, as two words.
Can you translate for our friend?</font>

1010
01:24:59,125 --> 01:25:02,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sang real, it means "royal blood."</font>

1011
01:25:03,329 --> 01:25:07,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">When the legend speaks of the
chalice that held the blood of Christ...</font>

1012
01:25:08,101 --> 01:25:13,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">it speaks in fact of the female womb
that carried Jesus' royal bloodline.</font>

1013
01:25:14,407 --> 01:25:17,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">But how could Christ
have a bloodline, unless...?</font>

1014
01:25:17,444 --> 01:25:20,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mary was pregnant
at the time of the Crucifixion.</font>

1015
01:25:28,855 --> 01:25:33,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">For her own safety and for that
of Christ's unborn child...</font>

1016
01:25:33,393 --> 01:25:36,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">she fled the Holy Land
and came to France.</font>

1017
01:25:36,663 --> 01:25:41,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">And here, it is said,
she gave birth to a daughter, Sarah.</font>

1018
01:25:42,936 --> 01:25:45,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">They know the child's name.</font>

1019
01:25:46,272 --> 01:25:48,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">- A little girl.
- Yes.</font>

1020
01:25:48,341 --> 01:25:50,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">If that were true,
it's adding insult to injury.</font>

1021
01:25:50,643 --> 01:25:51,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

1022
01:25:51,911 --> 01:25:55,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">The pagans found transcendence
through the joining of male to female.</font>

1023
01:25:55,748 --> 01:25:57,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">People found God through sex?</font>

1024
01:25:57,650 --> 01:26:00,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">In paganism, women were worshiped
as a route to heaven...</font>

1025
01:26:00,687 --> 01:26:03,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">but the modern Church
has a monopoly on that...</font>

1026
01:26:03,723 --> 01:26:05,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">in salvation through Jesus Christ.</font>

1027
01:26:06,159 --> 01:26:08,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he who keeps the keys to heaven
rules the world.</font>

1028
01:26:09,095 --> 01:26:12,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">Women, then, are a huge threat
to the Church.</font>

1029
01:26:12,465 --> 01:26:14,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Catholic Inquisition
soon publishes...</font>

1030
01:26:14,501 --> 01:26:17,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">what may be the most
blood-soaked book in human history.</font>

1031
01:26:18,065 --> 01:26:20,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Malleus Maleficarum.</font>

1032
01:26:21,569 --> 01:26:23,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Witches' Hammer.</font>

1033
01:26:23,537 --> 01:26:27,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">It instructed the clergy on how
to locate, torture and kill...</font>

1034
01:26:27,474 --> 01:26:29,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">all freethinking women.</font>

1035
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:35,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">In three centuries of witch hunts...</font>

1036
01:26:35,516 --> 01:26:39,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">50,000 women are captured,
burned alive at the stake.</font>

1037
01:26:39,420 --> 01:26:42,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, at least that.
Some say millions.</font>

1038
01:26:42,656 --> 01:26:44,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">Imagine, then, Robert...</font>

1039
01:26:44,858 --> 01:26:48,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">that Christ's throne
might live on in a female child.</font>

1040
01:26:49,730 --> 01:26:52,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">You asked what would
be worth killing for.</font>

1041
01:26:53,334 --> 01:26:56,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">Witness the greatest cover-up
in human history.</font>

1042
01:26:57,705 --> 01:26:59,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the secret
that the Priory of Sion...</font>

1043
01:27:00,140 --> 01:27:02,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">has defended
for over 20 centuries.</font>

1044
01:27:02,743 --> 01:27:05,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">They are the guardians
of the royal bloodline.</font>

1045
01:27:06,447 --> 01:27:09,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">The keepers of the proof
of our true past.</font>

1046
01:27:10,117 --> 01:27:14,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">They are the protectors of the living
descendants of Jesus Christ...</font>

1047
01:27:16,256 --> 01:27:17,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">and Mary Magdalene.</font>

1048
01:27:27,767 --> 01:27:28,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir Leigh?</font>

1049
01:27:29,802 --> 01:27:33,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes I wonder
who is serving whom.</font>

1050
01:27:33,806 --> 01:27:36,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">His sauces are not that fantastic.</font>

1051
01:27:39,245 --> 01:27:40,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, can I help you?</font>

1052
01:27:40,913 --> 01:27:42,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. They're on the news now.</font>

1053
01:27:45,985 --> 01:27:49,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">Living descendants? Is it possible?</font>

1054
01:27:49,489 --> 01:27:51,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not impossible.</font>

1055
01:27:52,392 --> 01:27:55,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have not been honest with me.
Your pictures are on the television.</font>

1056
01:27:56,129 --> 01:27:58,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are wanted for four murders!</font>

1057
01:27:58,464 --> 01:28:00,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why Vernet said
"killing spree."</font>

1058
01:28:00,933 --> 01:28:04,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">You come into my home,
playing on my passions for the Grail.</font>

1059
01:28:04,570 --> 01:28:07,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's why he needed you.
- You will leave my house!</font>

1060
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:09,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Leigh, listen!
- No, I'm calling the police.</font>

1061
01:28:09,442 --> 01:28:11,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jacques Sauniere
was her grandfather.</font>

1062
01:28:14,647 --> 01:28:16,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the obsessive Priory scholar.</font>

1063
01:28:16,482 --> 01:28:18,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">You still keep lists
of who might be in the Priory?</font>

1064
01:28:19,919 --> 01:28:22,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll bet Jacques Sauniere
was on one of those lists.</font>

1065
01:28:24,691 --> 01:28:27,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was on your list of who could
be Grand Master, wasn't he?</font>

1066
01:28:27,527 --> 01:28:30,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- I'll bet he was right at the top.</font>

1067
01:28:30,296 --> 01:28:35,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">Four men murdered?
The same number as the guardians.</font>

1068
01:28:35,668 --> 01:28:38,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if the Priory was compromised,
the other senechaux dead?</font>

1069
01:28:39,138 --> 01:28:41,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if you yourself were dying,
a Grand Master?</font>

1070
01:28:41,874 --> 01:28:45,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'd have to pass the secret on
to someone you could trust.</font>

1071
01:28:45,545 --> 01:28:47,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone outside the society.</font>

1072
01:28:47,447 --> 01:28:52,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe someone whose training
you had begun but never finished.</font>

1073
01:28:55,021 --> 01:28:57,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robert, your ruse is pathetic.</font>

1074
01:28:58,658 --> 01:29:00,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not really.</font>

1075
01:29:01,594 --> 01:29:03,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, that's impossible.</font>

1076
01:29:06,966 --> 01:29:08,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can that really...?</font>

1077
01:29:11,003 --> 01:29:12,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it the keystone?</font>

1078
01:29:15,675 --> 01:29:18,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll even show it to you, Leigh.</font>

1079
01:29:18,378 --> 01:29:20,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you just tell us
what the hell it's for?</font>

1080
01:29:38,498 --> 01:29:40,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fache says to wait, so I wait.</font>

1081
01:29:40,433 --> 01:29:44,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's Fache thinking?
The truck is here. They're inside.</font>

1082
01:29:53,279 --> 01:29:54,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

1083
01:29:54,614 --> 01:29:57,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">As the legend foretold:</font>

1084
01:29:59,218 --> 01:30:01,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">"It hides beneath the Rose."</font>

1085
01:30:01,587 --> 01:30:03,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my.</font>

1086
01:30:10,096 --> 01:30:11,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leigh.</font>

1087
01:30:14,967 --> 01:30:16,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leigh?</font>

1088
01:30:17,402 --> 01:30:18,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please.</font>

1089
01:30:18,570 --> 01:30:20,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry. Yes, of course.</font>

1090
01:30:22,974 --> 01:30:24,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">Inside the keystone...</font>

1091
01:30:26,378 --> 01:30:27,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">there'll be a map.</font>

1092
01:30:28,079 --> 01:30:30,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">A map that will lead us
to the Holy Grail.</font>

1093
01:30:34,820 --> 01:30:37,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">To be trained by
the Grand Master himself.</font>

1094
01:30:38,223 --> 01:30:42,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did he pass down the fleur-de-lis?
Is that how you found this?</font>

1095
01:30:44,596 --> 01:30:47,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he must have sung you
the riddle songs.</font>

1096
01:30:47,666 --> 01:30:49,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know some of them.</font>

1097
01:30:58,477 --> 01:31:00,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you keep secrets?</font>

1098
01:31:01,913 --> 01:31:04,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you know a thing
and never say it again?</font>

1099
01:31:05,851 --> 01:31:06,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">And codes?</font>

1100
01:31:08,186 --> 01:31:12,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">I imagine they lie down
for you like lovers.</font>

1101
01:31:15,193 --> 01:31:20,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">A senechal. A guardian of the Grail
right here in my own home.</font>

1102
01:31:20,298 --> 01:31:23,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell him, please.
I don't know any of this.</font>

1103
01:31:23,368 --> 01:31:26,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leigh, it's not that simple.
She doesn't rem...</font>

1104
01:31:27,806 --> 01:31:29,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robert!</font>

1105
01:31:34,379 --> 01:31:35,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do not move, woman.</font>

1106
01:31:40,085 --> 01:31:41,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cripple.</font>

1107
01:31:43,388 --> 01:31:45,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put the box on the table.</font>

1108
01:31:46,124 --> 01:31:47,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, this trifle?</font>

1109
01:31:48,059 --> 01:31:52,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, perhaps we can make
a financial arrangement.</font>

1110
01:31:52,230 --> 01:31:55,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put the keystone on the table.</font>

1111
01:31:56,234 --> 01:31:57,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will not succeed.</font>

1112
01:32:00,171 --> 01:32:03,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only the worthy
can unlock the stone.</font>

1113
01:32:32,737 --> 01:32:35,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rip the gate down.</font>

1114
01:32:38,610 --> 01:32:40,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, well, my dear.</font>

1115
01:32:44,482 --> 01:32:45,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sit down.</font>

1116
01:32:46,017 --> 01:32:47,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.</font>

1117
01:32:47,619 --> 01:32:49,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are you?
- Yeah.</font>

1118
01:32:49,955 --> 01:32:52,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, well, make yourself useful,
you French fool.</font>

1119
01:32:52,490 --> 01:32:54,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get something
to restrain this monster.</font>

1120
01:32:59,664 --> 01:33:01,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">Above the joint.</font>

1121
01:33:02,133 --> 01:33:06,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fortunately,
a dragon most easy to slay.</font>

1122
01:33:06,905 --> 01:33:08,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's wearing a cilice.</font>

1123
01:33:09,107 --> 01:33:11,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">- A what?
- Well, look.</font>

1124
01:33:13,812 --> 01:33:16,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Inflicts pain so he can suffer
as Christ suffered.</font>

1125
01:33:19,818 --> 01:33:22,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not so common these days.</font>

1126
01:33:22,987 --> 01:33:24,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">Opus Dei.</font>

1127
01:33:25,089 --> 01:33:27,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remy, take care of this.</font>

1128
01:33:31,862 --> 01:33:33,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fache is Opus Dei.</font>

1129
01:33:34,632 --> 01:33:37,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">The policeman who's chasing us.
He wears the cross in the world.</font>

1130
01:33:37,801 --> 01:33:39,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robert.</font>

1131
01:33:41,772 --> 01:33:45,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I must say,
you two are anything but dull.</font>

1132
01:33:46,377 --> 01:33:47,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leigh?</font>

1133
01:33:49,513 --> 01:33:51,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want what's in this box?</font>

1134
01:33:52,583 --> 01:33:54,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need a way out of here.</font>

1135
01:33:54,518 --> 01:33:56,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, actually...</font>

1136
01:33:57,621 --> 01:33:59,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do have a plane.</font>

1137
01:34:09,867 --> 01:34:11,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Robert! Where do we go?
- Come along.</font>

1138
01:34:11,902 --> 01:34:13,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">- In here. Come in.
- Over here.</font>

1139
01:34:13,937 --> 01:34:16,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get the door. Hurry.</font>

1140
01:34:18,475 --> 01:34:20,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Over here. Over here. Sophie.</font>

1141
01:34:20,577 --> 01:34:21,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">Watch out!</font>

1142
01:34:23,213 --> 01:34:24,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be careful.</font>

1143
01:34:25,182 --> 01:34:26,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come, Rem...</font>

1144
01:34:34,024 --> 01:34:35,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shit.</font>

1145
01:34:38,395 --> 01:34:39,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">Easy.</font>

1146
01:35:02,453 --> 01:35:03,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus!</font>

1147
01:35:03,620 --> 01:35:04,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">Apropos.</font>

1148
01:35:07,458 --> 01:35:09,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't imagine
what your complaint is.</font>

1149
01:35:09,526 --> 01:35:12,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd be within my rights to shoot you
and let you rot in my woods!</font>

1150
01:35:12,730 --> 01:35:15,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put that away. We might need him.</font>

1151
01:35:15,733 --> 01:35:16,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">Better.</font>

1152
01:35:23,841 --> 01:35:25,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">Opus Dei.</font>

1153
01:35:26,443 --> 01:35:28,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What is it?
- A conservative Catholic sect.</font>

1154
01:35:29,146 --> 01:35:31,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">Opus Dei is a prelature
to the Vatican.</font>

1155
01:35:31,215 --> 01:35:34,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're saying the Vatican
is killing people for this box?</font>

1156
01:35:34,752 --> 01:35:36,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no. Not the Vatican...</font>

1157
01:35:36,887 --> 01:35:39,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">and not Opus Dei,
but we are in the middle of a war.</font>

going on forever.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">and on the other
an ancient group of despots...</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">For you will be hunted by angels.</font>

1195
01:38:25,688 --> 01:38:27,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">You believe in God?</font>

1196
01:38:28,925 --> 01:38:31,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your God doesn't
forgive murderers.</font>

1197
01:38:34,964 --> 01:38:36,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">He burns them.</font>

1198
01:38:48,010 --> 01:38:48,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sophie.</font>

1199
01:39:30,386 --> 01:39:31,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Teacher will be pleased.</font>

1200
01:39:32,153 --> 01:39:34,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">What will you do
once you have the Grail?</font>

1201
01:39:34,556 --> 01:39:35,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">Destroy it.</font>

1202
01:39:36,024 --> 01:39:39,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">The documents and the
sarcophagus, of course.</font>

1203
01:39:40,996 --> 01:39:42,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the heir?</font>

1204
01:39:46,201 --> 01:39:49,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you exercise the final edict?
Spill his blood?</font>

1205
01:39:50,271 --> 01:39:51,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">There will be no need.</font>

1206
01:39:51,940 --> 01:39:56,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once the sarcophagus is destroyed,
DNA testing will be impossible.</font>

1207
01:39:56,845 --> 01:39:59,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is no way to prove
a living bloodline.</font>

1208
01:40:00,281 --> 01:40:01,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if you had to...</font>

1209
01:40:03,551 --> 01:40:06,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">would you do as councils
have done before us?</font>

1210
01:40:15,563 --> 01:40:16,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Christ...</font>

1211
01:40:21,803 --> 01:40:26,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Christ sacrificed his life
for the betterment of humanity.</font>

1212
01:40:29,511 --> 01:40:32,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, too, may be the fate of his seed.</font>

1213
01:40:42,057 --> 01:40:43,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robert.</font>

1214
01:40:43,758 --> 01:40:47,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">When we land, you must go
straight to your embassy.</font>

1215
01:40:49,064 --> 01:40:50,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that so?</font>

1216
01:40:52,467 --> 01:40:54,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you see it?</font>

1217
01:40:54,769 --> 01:40:56,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">They never wanted you.</font>

1218
01:40:57,338 --> 01:41:00,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe even Fache didn't.</font>

1219
01:41:00,241 --> 01:41:03,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all about this...</font>

1220
01:41:03,511 --> 01:41:05,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">idiotic little box.</font>

1221
01:41:09,984 --> 01:41:11,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not too flattering.</font>

1222
01:41:12,620 --> 01:41:14,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">Crazy old man.</font>

1223
01:41:15,323 --> 01:41:17,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why leave me with this?</font>

1224
01:41:17,959 --> 01:41:20,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should just throw it away.</font>

1225
01:41:24,866 --> 01:41:26,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">He trusted you, Sophie.</font>

1226
01:41:27,669 --> 01:41:31,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">A guardian of the Holy Grail.</font>

1227
01:41:32,607 --> 01:41:34,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">It sounds so stupid.</font>

1228
01:41:36,211 --> 01:41:40,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's quite an honor,
if you think about it...</font>

1229
01:41:40,782 --> 01:41:42,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">and take it seriously.</font>

1230
01:41:42,517 --> 01:41:45,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">He took it seriously enough
to get himself killed.</font>

1231
01:41:45,954 --> 01:41:48,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not him. You.</font>

1232
01:41:50,959 --> 01:41:53,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was the only family I knew.</font>

1233
01:41:54,129 --> 01:41:56,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">And maybe I didn't know him at all.</font>

1234
01:41:58,032 --> 01:42:00,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm his marionette, Robert.</font>

1235
01:42:00,235 --> 01:42:03,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like a girl again,
just with no gift at the end.</font>

1236
01:42:09,077 --> 01:42:10,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you've done enough.</font>

1237
01:42:13,681 --> 01:42:18,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know why Sauniere
picked me to help you, Sophie.</font>

1238
01:42:20,655 --> 01:42:24,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I won't leave you alone
in all this.</font>

1239
01:42:30,331 --> 01:42:31,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two marionettes, then.</font>

1240
01:42:35,803 --> 01:42:37,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe this is why he chose you.</font>

1241
01:42:41,108 --> 01:42:43,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because you will stay.</font>

1242
01:42:58,926 --> 01:43:00,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need the flight plan.</font>

1243
01:43:01,028 --> 01:43:02,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ten minutes.</font>

1244
01:43:03,030 --> 01:43:05,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">I asked you to get it for me.</font>

1245
01:43:06,533 --> 01:43:08,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm on break.</font>

1246
01:43:09,903 --> 01:43:11,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come back in 10 minutes.</font>

1247
01:43:13,507 --> 01:43:15,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">My nose! My nose!</font>

1248
01:43:16,243 --> 01:43:17,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">The flight plan, please.</font>

1249
01:43:17,844 --> 01:43:18,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">You asshole!</font>

1250
01:43:32,092 --> 01:43:33,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not "cross."</font>

1251
01:43:35,062 --> 01:43:36,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Spear"?</font>

1252
01:43:43,370 --> 01:43:44,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened to her?</font>

1253
01:43:45,672 --> 01:43:47,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one knows.</font>

1254
01:43:47,708 --> 01:43:51,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mary Magdalene lived out
her days in hiding.</font>

1255
01:43:52,713 --> 01:43:55,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the zealots pursued her still...</font>

1256
01:43:55,716 --> 01:44:00,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">even in death, trying to destroy
proof of her existence.</font>

1257
01:44:01,088 --> 01:44:03,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">But she always had her Knights.</font>

1258
01:44:03,624 --> 01:44:06,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brave men sworn to defend her.</font>

1259
01:44:06,260 --> 01:44:08,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see, to worship
before her sarcophagus...</font>

1260
01:44:09,329 --> 01:44:12,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">to kneel before the bones
of Mary Magdalene...</font>

1261
01:44:12,799 --> 01:44:15,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">was to remember all those
who were robbed of their power...</font>

1262
01:44:16,169 --> 01:44:17,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">who were oppressed.</font>

1263
01:44:17,571 --> 01:44:22,008

her sarcophagus...</font>

1266
01:44:28,515 --> 01:44:31,484

1268
01:44:43,630 --> 01:44:46,258

"It hides beneath the Rose."</font>

1269

1309
01:47:41,006 --> 01:47:43,099

1313
01:47:53,652 --> 01:47:56,086

I'll take care of the controller.</font>

1321

you're transporting fugitives...</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">You can start with him.</font>

1343
01:51:10,648 --> 01:51:12,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">Search the plane.</font>

1344
01:51:12,417 --> 01:51:13,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

1345
01:51:25,863 --> 01:51:27,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could run them over.</font>

1346
01:51:33,037 --> 01:51:34,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bad tip.</font>

1347
01:51:36,174 --> 01:51:37,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let him go.</font>

1348
01:51:42,046 --> 01:51:44,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">The French cannot be trusted.</font>

1349
01:51:53,123 --> 01:51:54,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone comfy?</font>

1350
01:51:56,560 --> 01:51:57,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">Biscuits?</font>

1351
01:51:58,095 --> 01:51:59,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">They didn't notice anything?</font>

1352
01:52:00,163 --> 01:52:04,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, people rarely notice things right
in front of their eyes, don't you find?</font>

1353
01:52:18,715 --> 01:52:21,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you have the bonds, bishop?</font>

1354
01:52:21,485 --> 01:52:22,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I do, Teacher.</font>

1355
01:52:22,919 --> 01:52:26,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have chosen an Opus Dei
residence for the exchange.</font>

1356
01:52:26,423 --> 01:52:27,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am honored.</font>

1357
01:52:28,125 --> 01:52:32,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">By the time you get to London,
I will have the Grail.</font>

1358
01:52:35,532 --> 01:52:38,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I take it the news is good, then.
- I fly to London.</font>

1359
01:52:38,702 --> 01:52:40,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Teacher is waiting for me there.</font>

1360
01:52:40,904 --> 01:52:44,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">He has chosen a house of Opus Dei
to make the exchange.</font>

1361
01:52:44,708 --> 01:52:49,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mere currency
for the location of the Grail.</font>

1362
01:52:49,279 --> 01:52:51,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">Imagine it.</font>

1363
01:52:57,154 --> 01:53:02,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember, if we are discovered by
the Vatican, we are excommunicated.</font>

1364
01:53:02,359 --> 01:53:05,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So should anything go wrong...
- Yes, I know, I know.</font>

1365
01:53:06,496 --> 01:53:08,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">This council does not exist.</font>

1366
01:53:09,166 --> 01:53:10,895

<font color="#FFFFFF">Old friend. Heaven protect you.</font>

1368
01:53:25,015 --> 01:53:26,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep an eye out for the police.</font>

1369
01:53:40,130 --> 01:53:42,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">I must say, Robert,
I'm quite impressed...</font>

1370
01:53:42,966 --> 01:53:46,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">by the way you withstood
my little aeroplane.</font>

1371
01:53:47,871 --> 01:53:49,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did he never tell you?</font>

1372
01:53:49,606 --> 01:53:52,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">When he was a boy,
young Robert fell into a well.</font>

1374
01:53:54,945 --> 01:53:56,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seven.</font>

1375
01:53:58,782 --> 01:54:01,842

screaming his lungs out...</font>

1376
01:54:02,052 --> 01:54:04,043

1377
01:54:04,254 --> 01:54:06,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">When they found him,
he was nearly catatonic.</font>

1378
01:54:06,990 --> 01:54:08,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help!</font>

1379
01:54:09,125 --> 01:54:10,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was a long time ago.</font>

1380
01:54:10,660 --> 01:54:12,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, now, now, Robert.</font>

1381
01:54:12,462 --> 01:54:16,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">You above all people shouldn't be one
to dismiss the influence of the past.</font>

1382
01:54:22,172 --> 01:54:25,471

I always forget it's right here.</font>

1383
01:54:25,675 --> 01:54:31,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">Built 1185 and modern London
just sprang up right around it.</font>

1384
01:54:34,451 --> 01:54:38,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me, why has the Priory kept the
Grail location secret all these years?</font>

1385
01:54:38,922 --> 01:54:39,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

1386
01:54:40,290 --> 01:54:42,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some say the Priory wait
for the heir to reveal himself...</font>

1387
01:54:43,126 --> 01:54:44,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">which is especially odd...</font>

1388
01:54:45,095 --> 01:54:48,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">since legend suggests he may not
know his own true identity.</font>

1389
01:54:56,439 --> 01:54:57,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello?</font>

1390
01:54:58,207 --> 01:55:00,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do they make them so scary?</font>

1391
01:55:06,482 --> 01:55:07,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it's cold.</font>

1392
01:55:07,783 --> 01:55:11,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">"In London lies a knight
a Pope interred."</font>

1393
01:55:20,963 --> 01:55:24,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">So which tomb has an orb?</font>

1394
01:55:40,716 --> 01:55:43,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those knights
with their legs crossed...</font>

1395
01:55:44,119 --> 01:55:46,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">means they'd been
to the Holy Land.</font>

1396
01:55:46,388 --> 01:55:49,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two wear tunics over their armor...</font>

1397
01:55:49,825 --> 01:55:52,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">and two have full-length robes.</font>

1398
01:55:54,029 --> 01:55:55,758

1399
01:55:56,231 --> 01:55:59,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">And one... Two are praying.</font>

1400
01:56:01,804 --> 01:56:03,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">This one has his arms at his sides.</font>

1401
01:56:03,973 --> 01:56:07,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, and this poor fellow
has almost disappeared entirely.</font>

1402
01:56:07,843 --> 01:56:12,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't see any orb
that ought be on a tomb.</font>

1403
01:56:13,449 --> 01:56:16,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Ought be on his tomb."
Are we looking for a missing orb?</font>

1404
01:56:16,385 --> 01:56:18,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe.</font>

1405
01:56:29,064 --> 01:56:30,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">These aren't tombs.</font>

1406
01:56:30,833 --> 01:56:33,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What? Yes, of course they are.
- No.</font>

1407
01:56:33,402 --> 01:56:35,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">- They're effigies.
- What?</font>

1408
01:56:35,604 --> 01:56:37,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not tombs. There's no bodies here.</font>

1409
01:56:37,873 --> 01:56:39,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">This place is wrong.</font>

1410
01:56:41,343 --> 01:56:44,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can we go now? We should go.</font>

1411
01:56:47,883 --> 01:56:49,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sophie! No!</font>

1412
01:56:51,320 --> 01:56:52,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is the keystone?</font>

1413
01:56:53,889 --> 01:56:55,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do not test me!</font>

1414
01:56:55,224 --> 01:56:56,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let her go!
- Don't hurt her.</font>

1415
01:56:56,692 --> 01:56:58,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me the keystone! Give it to me!</font>

1416
01:56:58,961 --> 01:57:00,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here! Here! Here it is! Here it is.</font>

1417
01:57:00,863 --> 01:57:04,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just let her go, and you and I can...
We'll come to some agreement.</font>

1418
01:57:05,100 --> 01:57:06,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remy.</font>

1419
01:57:09,905 --> 01:57:12,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remy. No, no, no. No, put it away.</font>

1420
01:57:13,742 --> 01:57:16,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put it away. They're too close
together. You don't have a clear shot.</font>

1421
01:57:17,179 --> 01:57:19,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes, I do.
- What do you think you're doing?</font>

1422
01:57:21,817 --> 01:57:26,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, professor. For a moment,
this was getting complicated.</font>

1423
01:57:26,422 --> 01:57:28,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, this is absurd.
Oh, for God's sake, man!</font>

1424
01:57:31,827 --> 01:57:33,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was satisfying.</font>

1425
01:57:34,129 --> 01:57:35,994

1426

1427
01:57:41,170 --> 01:57:42,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

1428
01:57:47,843 --> 01:57:49,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here. You okay?</font>

1429
01:57:55,350 --> 01:57:56,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry.</font>

1432
01:58:53,307 --> 01:58:56,538

1446
02:00:02,476 --> 02:00:04,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very advanced surveillance.</font>

1447
02:00:09,550 --> 02:00:10,847

is Sir Isaac Newton.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">he was also a Grand Master
of the Priory as well.</font>

the Catholic Church...</font>

1502

his colleague, Alexander Pope.</font>

How did I miss that?</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. Isaac Newton's tomb.</font>

1510
02:05:55,227 --> 02:05:56,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">An orb.</font>

1511
02:05:56,628 --> 02:06:01,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. Which one? It's not possible
to tell if a particular orb is missing.</font>

1512
02:06:01,800 --> 02:06:05,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">"An orb with Rosy flesh

Constellations. Signs of the zodiac.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">others might call it God's will.</font>

1523
02:06:44,810 --> 02:06:47,301

1524
02:06:47,679 --> 02:06:50,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could solve the riddle alone.</font>

1525
02:06:51,617 --> 02:06:53,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I was unworthy.</font>

1526
02:06:53,285 --> 02:06:54,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you...</font>

1527
02:06:55,387 --> 02:06:57,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have a reason to be here.</font>

Sauniere's last words?</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Leigh.</font>

1534

1536
02:07:21,078 --> 02:07:24,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No. Robert, tell her.</font>

1537
02:07:24,315 --> 02:07:28,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">When history is written,
murderers are heroes.</font>

1538
02:07:30,221 --> 02:07:32,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">You self-righteous bastard!</font>

1539
02:07:32,456 --> 02:07:33,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to just walk away.</font>

1540
02:07:33,958 --> 02:07:35,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, don't. Don't.
- Walk away.</font>

02:07:45,970 --> 02:07:47,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anything.</font>

1543
02:07:51,242 --> 02:07:52,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you understand?</font>

1544
02:07:54,378 --> 02:07:56,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">So now...</font>

1545
02:07:57,248 --> 02:07:59,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">can't we all be friends again?</font>

1546
02:08:00,584 --> 02:08:01,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">This way.</font>

1547
02:08:38,155 --> 02:08:41,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to put this gun down.
I only want you both to listen.</font>

1548
02:08:43,828 --> 02:08:45,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm listening now.</font>

1549
02:08:45,629 --> 02:08:47,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">For 2000 years...</font>

1550

<font color="#FFFFFF">the Church has rained oppression
and atrocity upon mankind...</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">crushed passion and idea alike,
all in the name of their walking God.</font>

an end to all that suffering...</font>

to its knees.</font>

1554

<font color="#FFFFFF">Armed police!</font>

1555
02:09:08,886 --> 02:09:10,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drop your weapon!</font>

1556
02:09:13,791 --> 02:09:14,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop, Silas!</font>

1557
02:09:27,605 --> 02:09:30,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are betrayed, my son.</font>

1558
02:09:31,342 --> 02:09:33,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">The living heir must be revealed.</font>

1559
02:09:34,445 --> 02:09:36,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus must be shown
for what he was.</font>

1560
02:09:36,881 --> 02:09:40,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not miraculous, simply man.</font>

1561
02:09:41,185 --> 02:09:42,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

1562
02:09:44,822 --> 02:09:46,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">Armed police!</font>

1563
02:09:46,791 --> 02:09:49,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drop your weapon! Drop it! Drop it!</font>

1564
02:09:59,336 --> 02:10:01,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put it down now! Put it down!</font>

1565
02:10:09,547 --> 02:10:11,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am a ghost.</font>

1566
02:10:12,750 --> 02:10:15,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">The dark con can be exposed.</font>

1567
02:10:15,586 --> 02:10:20,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mankind can finally be set free,
and we can do it, Robert.</font>

1568
02:10:22,159 --> 02:10:23,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">The three of us.</font>

1569
02:10:41,611 --> 02:10:43,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">How is Silas?</font>

1570
02:10:43,213 --> 02:10:45,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is he...? Is he alive?</font>

1571
02:10:45,915 --> 02:10:47,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">The monk?</font>

1572
02:10:50,587 --> 02:10:53,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bishop, how would you know
this killer's name?</font>

1573
02:10:55,091 --> 02:10:56,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get me out of here, Fache.</font>

1574
02:10:57,360 --> 02:10:58,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait.</font>

1575
02:11:01,865 --> 02:11:04,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">Langdon never came to you
in confession, did he?</font>

1576
02:11:05,602 --> 02:11:09,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">One of your followers called you
about the crime-scene photos.</font>

1577
02:11:10,707 --> 02:11:15,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">I cannot be implicated here. There are
still important works to be done.</font>

1578
02:11:17,447 --> 02:11:18,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">You used me.</font>

1579
02:11:20,650 --> 02:11:22,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">God uses us all.</font>

1580
02:11:23,486 --> 02:11:25,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help me, Fache.</font>

1581
02:11:26,189 --> 02:11:27,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take him.</font>

1582
02:11:31,961 --> 02:11:33,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Did you get his cell phone?
- Yes, sir.</font>

1583
02:11:33,997 --> 02:11:36,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to need a trace.</font>

1584
02:11:38,902 --> 02:11:40,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your Silas is dead.</font>

1585
02:11:47,844 --> 02:11:49,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Priory's sacred charge...</font>

1586
02:11:49,779 --> 02:11:52,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">was to reveal the heir
at the dawn of the new millennium.</font>

1587
02:11:53,816 --> 02:11:58,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">The millennium came and went
and the living heir remained hidden.</font>

1588
02:11:59,155 --> 02:12:03,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Priory failed
in their sacred charge.</font>

1589
02:12:03,860 --> 02:12:05,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, what choice did I have?</font>

1590
02:12:10,166 --> 02:12:11,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">I sought out the enemy.</font>

1591
02:12:13,436 --> 02:12:17,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">I persuaded them, the Council
of Shadows, that I was an ally.</font>

1592
02:12:18,408 --> 02:12:22,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">I even asked them for money
so they would never suspect me.</font>

1593
02:12:22,612 --> 02:12:25,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rector, I made them call me.</font>

1594
02:12:26,149 --> 02:12:27,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Teacher."</font>

1595
02:12:27,383 --> 02:12:28,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why don't you and l...
- No.</font>

1596
02:12:28,818 --> 02:12:31,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robert, no words. On your knees.</font>

1597
02:12:31,854 --> 02:12:33,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do it.</font>

1598
02:12:33,589 --> 02:12:34,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I mean it. Down.</font>

1599
02:12:36,025 --> 02:12:38,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not you. No, my dear, you...</font>

1600
02:12:41,497 --> 02:12:43,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're my miracle, Sophie.</font>

1601
02:12:44,534 --> 02:12:46,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the guardian of the Grail.</font>

1602
02:12:47,937 --> 02:12:51,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">All the oppression of the poor
and the powerless...</font>

1603
02:12:51,641 --> 02:12:54,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">of those of different skin,
of women.</font>

1604
02:12:54,711 --> 02:12:57,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can put an end to all that.</font>

1605
02:12:58,147 --> 02:13:01,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must explode the truth
onto the world.</font>

1606
02:13:02,652 --> 02:13:04,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's your duty.</font>

1607
02:13:07,056 --> 02:13:09,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know the answer to this riddle.</font>

1608
02:13:11,260 --> 02:13:12,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Open the cryptex...</font>

1609
02:13:14,397 --> 02:13:16,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'll put down the gun.</font>

1610
02:13:34,249 --> 02:13:36,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have no idea how.</font>

1611
02:13:36,418 --> 02:13:38,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know the code.</font>

1612
02:13:38,487 --> 02:13:41,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">And even if I did, I wouldn't tell you.</font>

1613
02:13:46,795 --> 02:13:49,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like your grandfather, then.</font>

1614
02:13:49,831 --> 02:13:52,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Willing to die for your secret.</font>

1615
02:13:53,969 --> 02:13:57,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">But by the way you've been
looking at your hero...</font>

1616
02:13:57,672 --> 02:14:02,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wonder, would you
let him die for you?</font>

1617
02:14:02,811 --> 02:14:05,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">Open it, Sophie, to save his life.</font>

1618
02:14:05,213 --> 02:14:07,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Leigh, you can't just...
- Open the cryptex.</font>

1619
02:14:08,016 --> 02:14:09,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know how.</font>

1620
02:14:09,217 --> 02:14:11,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">Open it or he dies.</font>

1621
02:14:11,319 --> 02:14:13,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I swear, I don't know.
- Do it! Do it!</font>

1622
02:14:13,422 --> 02:14:14,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Stop it!
- I don't know!</font>

1623
02:14:14,923 --> 02:14:16,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop it!</font>

1624
02:14:21,830 --> 02:14:23,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">She can't do it, Leigh.</font>

1625
02:14:35,877 --> 02:14:37,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">But give me a moment.</font>

1626
02:14:47,856 --> 02:14:49,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robert.</font>

1627
02:15:02,671 --> 02:15:03,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

1628
02:15:04,606 --> 02:15:05,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please.</font>

1629
02:16:25,987 --> 02:16:27,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

1630
02:16:37,598 --> 02:16:38,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

1631

<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

1632
02:16:51,178 --> 02:16:52,338

<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, the map. It's ruined.</font>

1636
02:17:06,627 --> 02:17:08,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">The map is ruined.</font>

1637
02:17:09,029 --> 02:17:10,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Grail.</font>

1638
02:17:10,965 --> 02:17:12,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's lost.</font>

1639
02:17:12,800 --> 02:17:14,267
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Grail is gone.</font>

1640
02:17:14,635 --> 02:17:17,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only the worthy
find the Grail, Leigh.</font>

1641
02:17:18,472 --> 02:17:20,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">You taught me that.</font>

1642
02:17:23,577 --> 02:17:24,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">Armed police!</font>

1643
02:17:24,878 --> 02:17:27,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drop it! Drop your weapon!</font>

1644
02:17:27,514 --> 02:17:28,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put the gun down.</font>

1645
02:17:31,652 --> 02:17:33,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put the gun down.</font>

1646
02:17:38,759 --> 02:17:41,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">That one. The old man.</font>

1647
02:17:41,729 --> 02:17:42,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're under arrest!</font>

1648
02:17:42,896 --> 02:17:45,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defense...</font>

1649
02:17:45,299 --> 02:17:47,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you do not mention,
when questioned...</font>

1650
02:17:47,401 --> 02:17:49,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">something which you
later rely on in court.</font>

1651
02:17:49,603 --> 02:17:52,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anything you do say
will be given in evidence.</font>

1652
02:18:02,950 --> 02:18:05,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll have some questions for you.</font>

1653
02:18:40,654 --> 02:18:43,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">Big crowd out there now.</font>

1654
02:18:43,724 --> 02:18:47,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you for your statements.
You are free to go, of course.</font>

1655
02:18:56,236 --> 02:18:58,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry. You thought
he was your friend, no?</font>

1656
02:18:59,139 --> 02:19:01,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">It wasn't only us, was it?</font>

1657
02:19:03,210 --> 02:19:04,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">He used you too.</font>

1658
02:19:07,014 --> 02:19:08,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leave us, please.</font>

1659
02:19:11,752 --> 02:19:12,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leave us, please.</font>

1660
02:19:24,231 --> 02:19:26,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should have been smarter.</font>

1661
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:29,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">I acted on faith, I suppose.</font>

1662
02:19:30,237 --> 02:19:31,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

1663
02:19:32,873 --> 02:19:34,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many?</font>

1664
02:19:34,675 --> 02:19:37,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your grandfather, the other three,
maybe more.</font>

1665
02:19:39,146 --> 02:19:43,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">The monk was given to Teabing
as a gift, it seems.</font>

1666
02:19:44,917 --> 02:19:47,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">To do as he asked.</font>

1667
02:19:47,420 --> 02:19:50,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">Teabing killed the servant himself,
you know.</font>

1668
02:19:50,857 --> 02:19:53,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Remy?
- Yes.</font>

1669
02:19:53,860 --> 02:19:54,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">By poison.</font>

1670
02:19:57,697 --> 02:20:00,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">How much of it
have you been able to figure out?</font>

1671
02:20:01,267 --> 02:20:05,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some. Not enough for it
to make sense.</font>

1672
02:20:06,239 --> 02:20:07,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">It won't ever make sense.</font>

1673
02:20:19,218 --> 02:20:20,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

1674
02:20:35,368 --> 02:20:38,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">He forgot everything we've learned.</font>

1675
02:20:39,105 --> 02:20:41,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything we teach.</font>

1676
02:20:44,343 --> 02:20:47,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's why we study history.</font>

1677
02:20:47,914 --> 02:20:50,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we'll stop killing each other.</font>

1678
02:21:13,039 --> 02:21:16,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robert! Robert! Robert!
How could you do it?</font>

1679
02:21:16,943 --> 02:21:19,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">How could you? Robert!</font>

1680
02:21:19,545 --> 02:21:21,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">To destroy our hope of freedom.</font>

1681
02:21:22,248 --> 02:21:25,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">To deny every pilgrim the chance
to kneel at the tomb of the Magdalene.</font>

1682
02:21:25,751 --> 02:21:26,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">How could you?</font>

1683
02:21:31,691 --> 02:21:33,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">You couldn't! You solved it.</font>

1684
02:21:36,095 --> 02:21:39,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">You took the scroll out
before it broke!</font>

1685
02:21:39,765 --> 02:21:43,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">You solved it. Oh, you'll find it, Robert.
You'll find it. You know what to do.</font>

1686
02:21:43,936 --> 02:21:46,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll find the Grail,
you'll kneel before her...</font>

1687
02:21:46,372 --> 02:21:48,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you'll set her free
upon the world!</font>

1688
02:21:48,608 --> 02:21:52,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">That man there,
he's got the map to the Holy Grail!</font>

1689
02:22:02,522 --> 02:22:07,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">There was every orb conceivable
on that tomb except one:</font>

1690
02:22:08,361 --> 02:22:12,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">The orb which fell from the heavens
and inspired Newton's life's work.</font>

1691
02:22:12,732 --> 02:22:17,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">Work that incurred the wrath
of the Church until his dying day.</font>

1692
02:22:20,873 --> 02:22:22,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">A-P-P-L-E.</font>

1693
02:22:23,442 --> 02:22:24,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">Apple.</font>

1694
02:22:39,258 --> 02:22:42,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Holy Grail 'neath
ancient Roslin waits</font>

1695
02:22:42,428 --> 02:22:44,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">The blade and chalice
guarding o'er her gates</font>

1696
02:22:44,997 --> 02:22:47,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Adorned in masters'
loving art, she lies</font>

1697
02:22:47,265 --> 02:22:51,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">She rests at last
beneath the starry skies</font>

1698
02:22:52,771 --> 02:22:54,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I know where she's gone.</font>

1699
02:22:55,607 --> 02:22:58,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think the Grail has gone home.</font>

1700
02:23:17,996 --> 02:23:22,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">Built by the Templars themselves.
Named for the original Rose Line.</font>

1701
02:23:23,034 --> 02:23:24,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rosslyn Chapel.</font>

1702
02:23:26,037 --> 02:23:27,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">So this is it.</font>

1703
02:23:28,807 --> 02:23:30,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">The gift at the end.</font>

1704
02:23:31,643 --> 02:23:35,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">"The Holy Grail 'neath
ancient Roslin waits."</font>

1705
02:23:36,314 --> 02:23:39,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">You never told me the joke
Sauniere made of you.</font>

1706
02:23:39,818 --> 02:23:41,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">What was it?</font>

1707
02:23:41,653 --> 02:23:43,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">He called me a flatfoot.</font>

1708
02:23:43,855 --> 02:23:46,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">A beat cop of history.</font>

1709
02:23:46,858 --> 02:23:48,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, a dumb policeman...</font>

1710
02:23:49,127 --> 02:23:52,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">who just does his job
day after day, of history.</font>

1711
02:23:52,731 --> 02:23:56,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, his father was one.
A policeman.</font>

1712
02:23:57,135 --> 02:24:01,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sauniere said he was the most
honorable man he had ever known.</font>

1713
02:24:05,744 --> 02:24:08,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are who we protect, I think.</font>

1714
02:24:09,347 --> 02:24:11,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">What we stand up for.</font>

1715
02:24:22,994 --> 02:24:24,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jewish...</font>

1716
02:24:25,497 --> 02:24:28,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">Christian, Egyptian...</font>

1717
02:24:29,534 --> 02:24:31,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">Masonic, pagan...</font>

1718
02:24:33,004 --> 02:24:34,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">Templar crosses...</font>

1719
02:24:35,340 --> 02:24:36,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">pyramids.</font>

1720
02:24:44,482 --> 02:24:48,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I've been here before.</font>

1721
02:24:48,453 --> 02:24:49,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sophie.</font>

1722
02:25:09,474 --> 02:25:11,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">A very long time ago.</font>

1723
02:25:13,545 --> 02:25:15,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come along, Sophie.</font>

1724
02:25:30,562 --> 02:25:31,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sophie.</font>

1725
02:25:32,664 --> 02:25:33,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">Over here.</font>

1726
02:25:41,539 --> 02:25:45,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">"The blade and chalice
guarding o'er her gates."</font>

1727
02:25:45,510 --> 02:25:47,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pagan symbols for
male and female.</font>

1728
02:25:49,948 --> 02:25:51,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fused as one.</font>

1729
02:25:52,149 --> 02:25:54,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">As the pagans would have wanted.</font>

1730
02:25:55,886 --> 02:25:57,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're about to close, I'm afraid.</font>

1731
02:26:03,861 --> 02:26:06,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're just gonna be a moment.</font>

1732
02:26:55,412 --> 02:26:56,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robert.</font>

1733
02:27:29,913 --> 02:27:31,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never seen that before.</font>

1734
02:27:36,987 --> 02:27:39,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">The style is...</font>

1735
02:27:40,824 --> 02:27:42,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's unmistakable.</font>

1736
02:27:51,668 --> 02:27:53,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">These could have been painted by
Leonardo da Vinci.</font>

1737
02:27:56,073 --> 02:27:59,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Adorned in masters'
loving art, she lies."</font>

1738
02:27:59,743 --> 02:28:05,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">"She rests at last
beneath the starry skies."</font>

1739
02:28:24,334 --> 02:28:26,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">The fleur-de-lis.</font>

1740
02:29:17,119 --> 02:29:18,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was here.</font>

1741
02:29:21,223 --> 02:29:22,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her sarcophagus.</font>

1742
02:29:24,927 --> 02:29:26,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mary Magdalene.</font>

1743
02:29:28,230 --> 02:29:30,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Holy Grail herself.</font>

1744
02:29:31,834 --> 02:29:33,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was here.</font>

1745
02:29:40,609 --> 02:29:44,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">With modern DNA testing,
those bones...</font>

1746
02:29:44,981 --> 02:29:48,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">could have shown definitive proof
of a bloodline.</font>

1747
02:29:50,686 --> 02:29:52,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where did she go?</font>

1748
02:29:53,356 --> 02:29:55,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did the Church finally get her?</font>

1749
02:30:10,306 --> 02:30:12,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is incredible. Look at this.</font>

1750
02:30:13,042 --> 02:30:16,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at this. These records
go back thousands of years.</font>

1751
02:30:17,613 --> 02:30:20,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">They date back
to the death of Christ.</font>

1752
02:30:22,752 --> 02:30:26,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good God, could these
really be the Grail documents?</font>

1753
02:30:48,177 --> 02:30:52,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did he want from us?
To find her sarcophagus?</font>

1754
02:30:53,449 --> 02:30:56,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">How was I ever supposed
to figure all this out?</font>

1755
02:30:56,585 --> 02:30:58,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">When you and your
grandfather fought...</font>

1756
02:30:59,188 --> 02:31:01,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">was it something about your past?</font>

1757
02:31:03,726 --> 02:31:05,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">How could you know that?</font>

1758
02:31:06,195 --> 02:31:08,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">About how your parents died?</font>

1759
02:31:09,932 --> 02:31:11,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sophie?</font>

1760
02:31:13,869 --> 02:31:16,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was during primary school.</font>

1761
02:31:17,706 --> 02:31:19,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was in his library.</font>

1762
02:31:21,510 --> 02:31:23,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doing research.</font>

1763
02:31:23,212 --> 02:31:25,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was trying to find out
about my family.</font>

1764
02:31:26,048 --> 02:31:28,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sophie, where are you, princess?</font>

1765
02:31:29,118 --> 02:31:31,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanted to know about them.</font>

1766
02:31:32,121 --> 02:31:34,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I couldn't find any records.</font>

1767
02:31:35,291 --> 02:31:37,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not of their death...</font>

1768
02:31:38,661 --> 02:31:40,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">not of the accident.</font>

1769
02:31:41,197 --> 02:31:43,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd asked him for as long
as I could remember...</font>

1770
02:31:43,732 --> 02:31:45,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">but he would never tell me.</font>

1771
02:31:45,234 --> 02:31:46,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you, no.</font>

1772
02:31:49,371 --> 02:31:50,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">But why can't I?</font>

1773
02:31:51,173 --> 02:31:53,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">He stood over me...</font>

1774
02:31:54,743 --> 02:31:56,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he wouldn't let me leave.</font>

1775
02:31:56,979 --> 02:31:58,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're dead. Dead and buried.</font>

1776
02:31:59,315 --> 02:32:00,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never look for them, Sophie.</font>

1777
02:32:01,249 --> 02:32:02,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Promise me.</font>

1778
02:32:03,918 --> 02:32:04,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">Swear it!</font>

1779
02:32:05,753 --> 02:32:06,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">Swear it to me!</font>

1780
02:32:17,532 --> 02:32:19,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">I kept my promise.</font>

1781
02:32:23,138 --> 02:32:25,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">The next week he sent me
to boarding school.</font>

1782
02:32:27,642 --> 02:32:31,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">One weekend
I came home unexpectedly.</font>

1783
02:32:32,147 --> 02:32:34,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what I saw
my grandfather doing...</font>

1784
02:32:35,917 --> 02:32:37,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some ritual.</font>

1785
02:32:39,554 --> 02:32:41,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was so frightened.</font>

1786
02:32:45,827 --> 02:32:47,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">We hardly ever spoke again.</font>

1787
02:32:51,733 --> 02:32:56,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you have any memories of your
grandfather before the accident?</font>

1788
02:32:57,839 --> 02:33:00,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">Before your parents were killed?</font>

1789
02:33:00,742 --> 02:33:03,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. No. I don't know.</font>

1790
02:33:04,479 --> 02:33:05,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

1791
02:33:08,349 --> 02:33:10,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I don't think
he was your grandfather.</font>

1792
02:33:30,205 --> 02:33:32,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">These are my parents.</font>

1793
02:33:34,342 --> 02:33:35,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">My brother.</font>

1794
02:33:37,378 --> 02:33:39,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">And this is you, isn't it?</font>

1795
02:33:44,152 --> 02:33:47,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">The paper says
the entire family was killed.</font>

1796
02:33:48,323 --> 02:33:52,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">The mother, the father, the boy, 6...</font>

1797
02:33:53,995 --> 02:33:56,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the girl, 4.</font>

1798
02:33:57,865 --> 02:34:02,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">But your name was never Sauniere.
It's Saint-Clair.</font>

1799
02:34:05,907 --> 02:34:08,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's one of the oldest families
in France.</font>

1800
02:34:08,910 --> 02:34:12,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's from a line of the
Merovingian kings.</font>

1801
02:34:21,256 --> 02:34:23,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">Royal blood.</font>

1802
02:34:25,093 --> 02:34:26,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was so wrong.</font>

1803
02:34:28,329 --> 02:34:32,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sauniere didn't want you to help guard
the secret of the Holy Grail.</font>

1804
02:34:34,369 --> 02:34:35,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sophie...</font>

1805
02:34:38,206 --> 02:34:40,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">you are the secret.</font>

1806
02:34:41,709 --> 02:34:44,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">You survived the accident.</font>

1807
02:34:44,445 --> 02:34:47,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">If it even was an accident.</font>

1808
02:34:47,282 --> 02:34:49,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Priory found out.</font>

1809
02:34:49,851 --> 02:34:53,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somehow they concealed
the fact that you were alive.</font>

1810
02:34:53,621 --> 02:34:56,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">They hid you with the
Grand Master himself...</font>

1811
02:34:57,458 --> 02:34:59,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">who raised you as his own.</font>

1812
02:35:00,695 --> 02:35:02,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">According to all of this...</font>

1813
02:35:04,032 --> 02:35:05,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Princess Sophie...</font>

1814
02:35:09,436 --> 02:35:10,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">you are the heir.</font>

1815
02:35:13,240 --> 02:35:15,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">The end of the bloodline.</font>

1816
02:35:16,777 --> 02:35:20,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are the last living descendent...</font>

1817
02:35:21,214 --> 02:35:23,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">of Jesus Christ.</font>

1818
02:36:08,528 --> 02:36:09,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is this?</font>

1819
02:36:11,932 --> 02:36:13,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sophie?</font>

1820
02:36:16,370 --> 02:36:17,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are you?</font>

1821
02:36:17,671 --> 02:36:20,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">There have been many names.</font>

1822
02:36:20,674 --> 02:36:22,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">The keepers.</font>

1823
02:36:23,343 --> 02:36:24,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guardians.</font>

1824
02:36:25,212 --> 02:36:27,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Priory of Sion.</font>

1825
02:36:27,848 --> 02:36:33,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">But to you, Sophie, we are friends
of the man who raised you:</font>

1826
02:36:33,620 --> 02:36:35,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jacques Sauniere.</font>

1827
02:36:37,657 --> 02:36:42,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">He would have wanted you to know
that he loved you very much.</font>

1828
02:36:43,897 --> 02:36:47,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that the Priory are here
to protect you now...</font>

1829
02:36:48,068 --> 02:36:51,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">as they have always
protected our family.</font>

1830
02:36:53,807 --> 02:36:55,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">I gave you up once...</font>

1831
02:36:56,710 --> 02:36:59,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">knowing I might
never see you again.</font>

1832
02:37:03,216 --> 02:37:05,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm your grandmother, Sophie.</font>

1833
02:37:06,319 --> 02:37:11,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have prayed for this moment
for a very long time.</font>

1834
02:37:13,326 --> 02:37:15,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome home, child.</font>

1835
02:37:39,519 --> 02:37:40,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

1836
02:37:43,089 --> 02:37:44,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">No more strings.</font>

1837
02:37:49,196 --> 02:37:52,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">His last breath to keep me safe.</font>

1838
02:37:56,937 --> 02:38:01,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">She has some things
she wants to tell me.</font>

1839
02:38:01,942 --> 02:38:04,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">About my family.</font>

1840
02:38:10,684 --> 02:38:11,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">What will you do?</font>

1841
02:38:12,952 --> 02:38:16,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">The legend will be revealed
when the heir reveals himself.</font>

1842
02:38:17,490 --> 02:38:19,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">They just got the pronoun wrong.</font>

1843
02:38:23,262 --> 02:38:24,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">She said when Sauniere died...</font>

1844
02:38:25,164 --> 02:38:28,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">he took the location
of Mary's sarcophagus with him.</font>

1845
02:38:29,134 --> 02:38:33,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">So there's no way to empirically prove
that I am related to her.</font>

1846
02:38:35,241 --> 02:38:37,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">What would you do, Robert?</font>

1847
02:38:38,143 --> 02:38:42,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, maybe there is no proof.
Maybe the Grail is lost forever.</font>

1848
02:38:42,581 --> 02:38:46,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, Sophie, the only thing that
matters is what you believe.</font>

1849
02:38:47,820 --> 02:38:50,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">History shows us
Jesus was an extraordinary man...</font>

1850
02:38:51,056 --> 02:38:53,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">a human inspiration. That's it.</font>

1851
02:38:53,859 --> 02:38:56,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's all the evidence
has ever proved.</font>

1852
02:38:58,097 --> 02:38:59,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">But...</font>

1853
02:39:00,165 --> 02:39:02,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">when I was a boy...</font>

1854
02:39:04,436 --> 02:39:08,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I was down in that well
Teabing told you about...</font>

1855
02:39:11,510 --> 02:39:14,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought I was going to die,
Sophie.</font>

1856
02:39:16,248 --> 02:39:17,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">What I did...</font>

1857
02:39:18,417 --> 02:39:19,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">I prayed.</font>

1858
02:39:21,287 --> 02:39:25,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">I prayed to Jesus to keep me alive...</font>

1859
02:39:25,591 --> 02:39:27,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I could see my parents again...</font>

1860
02:39:27,526 --> 02:39:30,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I could go to school again...</font>

1861
02:39:30,529 --> 02:39:32,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I could play with my dog.</font>

1862
02:39:34,199 --> 02:39:37,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes I wonder
if I wasn't alone down there.</font>

1863
02:39:39,405 --> 02:39:42,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why does it have to be
human or divine?</font>

1864
02:39:42,341 --> 02:39:44,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe human is divine.</font>

1865
02:39:45,544 --> 02:39:47,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why couldn't Jesus
have been a father...</font>

1866
02:39:47,580 --> 02:39:50,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">and still been capable
of all those miracles?</font>

1867
02:39:50,816 --> 02:39:53,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like turning water into wine?</font>

1868
02:39:53,719 --> 02:39:57,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, who knows?
His blood is your blood.</font>

1869
02:39:57,556 --> 02:40:00,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe that junkie in the park
will never touch a drug again.</font>

1870
02:40:01,293 --> 02:40:04,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe you healed my phobia
with your hands.</font>

1871
02:40:04,496 --> 02:40:07,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">And maybe you're
a knight on a Grail quest.</font>

1872
02:40:10,336 --> 02:40:13,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, here's the question:</font>

1873
02:40:13,839 --> 02:40:16,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">A living descendent
of Jesus Christ...</font>

1874
02:40:18,077 --> 02:40:20,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">would she destroy faith?</font>

1875
02:40:21,180 --> 02:40:24,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or would she renew it?</font>

1876
02:40:26,652 --> 02:40:29,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">So again I say, what matters
is what you believe.</font>

1877
02:40:32,157 --> 02:40:33,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

1878
02:40:35,594 --> 02:40:36,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">For bringing me here.</font>

1879
02:40:39,031 --> 02:40:41,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">For letting him choose you...</font>

1880
02:40:42,234 --> 02:40:43,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir Robert.</font>

1881
02:40:53,712 --> 02:40:54,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">You take care.</font>

1882
02:40:56,281 --> 02:40:57,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

1883
02:41:22,106 --> 02:41:23,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

1884
02:41:36,220 --> 02:41:37,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nope.</font>

1885
02:41:38,489 --> 02:41:40,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe I'll do better with the wine.</font>

1886
02:41:44,295 --> 02:41:45,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">Godspeed.</font>

1887
02:42:44,422 --> 02:42:45,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bloodline.</font>

1888
02:42:49,260 --> 02:42:50,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rose Line.</font>

1889
02:42:57,401 --> 02:42:59,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Hides beneath the Rose."</font>

1890
02:44:58,021 --> 02:45:01,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">"The Holy Grail 'neath
ancient Roslin waits.</font>

1891
02:45:04,694 --> 02:45:08,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">Adorned in masters'
loving art, she lies.</font>

1892
02:45:24,147 --> 02:45:27,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">The blade and chalice
guarding o'er her gates.</font>

1893
02:46:07,290 --> 02:46:11,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">She rests at last
beneath starry skies."</font>
