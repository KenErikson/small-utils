1
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:15,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't let you out, Hedwig.</font>

2
00:01:15,539 --> 00:01:19,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not allowed to use magic
outside of school.</font>

3
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:23,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Besides, if Uncle Vernon—
- Harry Potter!</font>

4
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now you've done it.</font>

5
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:34,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's in there. Vernon?</font>

6
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:40,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm warning you, if you can't control
that bloody bird, it'll have to go.</font>

7
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:42,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">But she's bored.</font>

8
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:47,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">if I could only let her out
for an hour or two.</font>

9
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:51,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you can send secret messages
to your freaky little friends? No, sir.</font>

10
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:56,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I haven't had any messages
from any of my friends.</font>

11
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not one . . .</font>

12
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:00,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . all summer.</font>

13
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:03,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who would want to be
friends with you?</font>

14
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:08,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should think you'd be
a little more grateful.</font>

15
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:12,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've raised you since you were a baby,
given you the food off our table . . .</font>

16
00:02:12,259 --> 00:02:14,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . even let you have
Dudley's second bedroom . . .</font>

17
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . purely out of the goodness
of our hearts.</font>

18
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not now.
It's for when the Masons arrive.</font>

19
00:02:20,229 --> 00:02:23,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which should be any minute.</font>

20
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:26,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, let's go over our schedule
once again, shall we?</font>

21
00:02:26,949 --> 00:02:28,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Petunia, when the Masons arrive,
you will be . . .?</font>

22
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:32,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the lounge, waiting to welcome
them graciously to our home.</font>

23
00:02:32,909 --> 00:02:36,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Good. And, Dudley, you will be . . .?
- I'll be waiting to open the door.</font>

24
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excellent.</font>

25
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you?</font>

26
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:50,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise
and pretending that I don't exist.</font>

27
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Too right, you will.</font>

28
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">With any luck, this could be the day
I make the biggest deal of my career . . .</font>

29
00:02:55,979 --> 00:02:59,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . and you will not mess it up.</font>

30
00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:15,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry Potter, such an honor it is.</font>

31
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:23,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who are you?
- Dobby, sir. Dobby the house-elf.</font>

32
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:25,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not to be rude or anything . . .</font>

33
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:29,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . but this isn't a great time for me
to have a house-elf in my bedroom.</font>

34
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, sir. Dobby understands.</font>

35
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just that Dobby
has come to tell you . . . .</font>

36
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:40,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is difficult, sir.
Dobby wonders where to begin.</font>

37
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:46,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why don't you sit down?
- Sit down? Sit down?</font>

38
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:54,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dobby, I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to offend you or anything.</font>

39
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Offend Dobby?</font>

40
00:03:56,699 --> 00:03:59,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dobby has heard
of your greatness, sir . . .</font>

41
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:05,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . but never has he been asked
to sit down by a wizard, like an equal.</font>

42
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:08,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't have met
many decent wizards then.</font>

43
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:11,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I haven't.</font>

44
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was an awful thing to say.</font>

45
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:18,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!
- Stop, Dobby. Dobby, shush.</font>

46
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dobby, please, stop.</font>

47
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't mind that. It's just the cat.</font>

48
00:04:28,779 --> 00:04:33,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Bad Dobby.
- Stop! Stop, Dobby. Please, be quiet.</font>

49
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:35,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you all right?</font>

50
00:04:36,529 --> 00:04:39,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dobby had to punish himself, sir.</font>

51
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:42,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dobby almost spoke ill
of his family, sir.</font>

52
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:46,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Your family?
- The wizard family Dobby serves, sir.</font>

53
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:50,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dobby is bound to serve
one family forever.</font>

54
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:52,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">if they ever knew Dobby was here . . . .</font>

55
00:04:54,430 --> 00:05:00,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">But Dobby had to come. Dobby has
to protect Harry Potter. To warn him.</font>

56
00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:02,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry Potter must not go back . . .</font>

57
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:07,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . to Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year.</font>

58
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:12,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is a plot, a plot to make
most terrible things happen.</font>

59
00:05:13,069 --> 00:05:16,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">What terrible things?
Who's plotting them?</font>

60
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:19,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't say.</font>

61
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:25,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay, I understand. You can't say.
- Don't make me talk. L—</font>

62
00:05:27,329 --> 00:05:30,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Dobby. Dobby, put the lamp down.
- Bad Dobby.</font>

63
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">So when they arrive
at the ninth hole . . . .</font>

64
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:40,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me the lamp.</font>

65
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dobby, stop!</font>

66
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:49,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let me go.
- Get in there and keep quiet.</font>

67
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:53,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What the devil are you doing up here?
- I was just—</font>

68
00:05:53,689 --> 00:05:56,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just ruined the punch line
of my Japanese golfer joke.</font>

69
00:05:57,029 --> 00:05:58,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry.</font>

70
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:04,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">One more sound and you'll wish
you'd never been born, boy.</font>

71
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:08,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And fix that door.
- Yes, sir.</font>

72
00:06:10,339 --> 00:06:11,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">See why I've got to go back?</font>

73
00:06:12,129 --> 00:06:15,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't belong here.
I belong in your world, at Hogwarts.</font>

74
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:20,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's the only place I've got friends.
- Friends who don't write to Harry Potter?</font>

75
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I expect they've been . . . .</font>

76
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:28,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hang on. How do you know
my friends haven't been writing to me?</font>

77
00:06:29,019 --> 00:06:32,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry Potter mustn't
be angry with Dobby.</font>

78
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dobby hoped if Harry Potter
thought his friends had forgotten him . . .</font>

79
00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:40,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . Harry Potter might not want
to go back to school, sir.</font>

80
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Give me those. Now.
- No!</font>

81
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:01,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dobby, get back here.</font>

82
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dobby, please, no.</font>

83
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:12,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry Potter must say
he's not going back to school.</font>

84
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:15,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't. Hogwarts is my home.</font>

85
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:21,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then Dobby must do it, sir,
for Harry Potter's own good.</font>

86
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:26,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">It spread as far as the eye could see,
all over the floor of this building.</font>

87
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">One plumber said,
"Look at all that water. "</font>

88
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:31,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">The second plumber said,
"Yes, and that's just the top of it. "</font>

89
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm so sorry. It's my nephew.
He's very disturbed.</font>

90
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:52,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Meeting strangers upsets him.
That's why I kept him upstairs.</font>

91
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:06,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're never going back to that school.</font>

92
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:11,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're never going to see those
freaky friends of yours again. Never!</font>

93
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hiya, Harry.</font>

94
00:09:00,049 --> 00:09:04,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ron. Fred. George.
What are you all doing here?</font>

95
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:08,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rescuing you, of course.
Now, come on, get your trunk.</font>

96
00:09:14,769 --> 00:09:16,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">You better stand back.</font>

97
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:19,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go.</font>

98
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:26,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What was that?
- What was it?</font>

99
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:30,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Potter!</font>

100
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dad, what's going on?</font>

101
00:09:35,789 --> 00:09:36,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go. Go. Go.</font>

102
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dad, hurry up.</font>

103
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:42,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Come on.
- Come on, Harry, hurry up.</font>

104
00:09:44,049 --> 00:09:45,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">Petunia, he's escaping!</font>

105
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I've got you, Harry.
- Come here!</font>

106
00:09:50,059 --> 00:09:51,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let go of me!
- No, boy!</font>

107
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:55,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">You and that bloody pigeon
aren't going anywhere.</font>

108
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Get off!
- Drive!</font>

109
00:09:57,019 --> 00:09:58,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Right.
- Right!</font>

110
00:09:59,059 --> 00:10:00,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! No! No! No!</font>

111
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dad!</font>

112
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:17,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn.</font>

113
00:10:21,669 --> 00:10:25,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">By the way, Harry, happy birthday.</font>

114
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

115
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:58,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, come on.</font>

116
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, come on.</font>

117
00:11:09,549 --> 00:11:13,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Think it'd be all right if we had some?
- Yeah, Mum will never know.</font>

118
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not much, but it's home.</font>

119
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think it's brilliant.</font>

120
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:40,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where have you been?</font>

121
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:43,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry, how wonderful
to see you, dear.</font>

122
00:11:44,129 --> 00:11:47,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Beds empty. No note. Car gone.</font>

123
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:50,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">You could have died.
You could have been seen.</font>

124
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:54,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course, I don't
blame you, Harry, dear.</font>

125
00:11:54,259 --> 00:11:57,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">They were starving him, Mum.
There were bars on his window.</font>

126
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:02,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you best hope I don't put bars
on your window, Ronald Weasley.</font>

127
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, Harry,
time for a spot of breakfast.</font>

128
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:08,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here we are, Harry. Now, tuck in.</font>

129
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:12,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's it. There we go.</font>

130
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:16,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mummy, have you seen my jumper?
- Yes, dear, it was on the cat.</font>

131
00:12:16,789 --> 00:12:18,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello.</font>

132
00:12:22,789 --> 00:12:24,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did I do?</font>

133
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:28,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ginny. She's been talking about you
all summer. A bit annoying, really.</font>

134
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:31,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Morning, Weasleys.
- Morning, Dad.</font>

135
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:36,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What a night. Nine raids. Nine!
- Raids?</font>

136
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:40,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dad works in the Ministry of Magic,
in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office.</font>

137
00:12:40,889 --> 00:12:44,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dad loves Muggles,
thinks they're fascinating.</font>

138
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, now.</font>

139
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">And who are you?</font>

140
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, sir. I'm Harry, sir.
Harry Potter.</font>

141
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good Lord. Are you really?</font>

142
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:02,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, Ron has told us all about you,
of course. When did he get here?</font>

143
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">This morning.</font>

144
00:13:04,169 --> 00:13:09,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your sons flew that enchanted car
of yours to Surrey and back last night.</font>

145
00:13:09,379 --> 00:13:12,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you really? How did it go?</font>

146
00:13:12,929 --> 00:13:17,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean— That was very wrong
indeed, boys. Very wrong of you.</font>

147
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, Harry, you must know
all about Muggles.</font>

148
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:27,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me, what exactly
is the function of a rubber duck?</font>

149
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that'll be Errol with the post.</font>

150
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:43,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fetch it, will you, Percy, please?</font>

151
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:46,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Errol.
- He's always doing that.</font>

152
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:52,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, it's our Hogwarts letters.
They've sent us Harry's as well.</font>

153
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:55,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dumbledore must know you're here.
Doesn't miss a trick, that man.</font>

154
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:57,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- This lot won't come cheap.</font>

155
00:13:57,799 --> 00:14:02,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The spell books alone are expensive.
- We'll manage.</font>

156
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:07,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's only one place we're going to
get all of this. Diagon Alley.</font>

157
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right.</font>

158
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:12,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here we are, Harry.
You go first, dear.</font>

159
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:15,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">But Harry's never traveled
by Floo powder before, Mum.</font>

160
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Floo powder?</font>

161
00:14:16,529 --> 00:14:20,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">You go first, Ron, so that Harry
can see how it's done. Yes.</font>

162
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:23,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">In you go.</font>

163
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's it.</font>

164
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:30,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Diagon Alley.</font>

165
00:14:36,629 --> 00:14:40,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see? It's quite easy, dear.
Don't be afraid. Come on.</font>

166
00:14:41,889 --> 00:14:43,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

167
00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:46,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">In you go. That's it. Mind your head.</font>

168
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right.
Now, take your Floo powder.</font>

169
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:54,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's it, very good.</font>

170
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:58,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, don't forget to speak
very, very clearly.</font>

171
00:15:00,409 --> 00:15:02,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Diagonally.</font>

172
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What did he say, dear?
- Diagonally.</font>

173
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought he did.</font>

174
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:44,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Not lost, are you, my dear?
- I'm fine, thank you. I was just going . . . .</font>

175
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:48,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come with us. We'll help you
find your way back.</font>

176
00:16:49,429 --> 00:16:51,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No. Please—
- Harry?</font>

177
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hagrid!</font>

178
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:56,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you think
you're doing down here? Come on.</font>

179
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:07,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a mess, Harry. Skulking around
Knockturn Alley? Dodgy place.</font>

180
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:11,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't want no one to see you there.
People will think you're up to no good.</font>

181
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:13,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was lost, l—</font>

182
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hang on. What were you
doing down there then?</font>

183
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:22,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me? I was . . . . I was looking
for Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.</font>

184
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:25,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're ruining all the school cabbages.</font>

185
00:17:30,769 --> 00:17:32,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry. Hagrid.</font>

186
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Hermione.</font>

187
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:37,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's so good to see you.
- It's great to see you too.</font>

188
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:40,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did you do to your glasses?</font>

189
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:43,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oculus Reparo.</font>

190
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:50,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">I definitely need to remember that one.</font>

191
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll be all right now then, Harry?
Right. I'll leave you to it.</font>

192
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:55,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay, bye.
- Thank you. Bye.</font>

193
00:17:55,869 --> 00:17:57,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, everyone's been so worried.</font>

194
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:09,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry.</font>

195
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:12,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank goodness. We'd hoped
you'd only gone one grate too far.</font>

196
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Gilderoy Lockhart.</font>

197
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here he is.</font>

198
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mum fancies him.</font>

199
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make way there, please.
Let me by, madam. Thank you.</font>

200
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:31,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me, little girl.
This is for the Daily Prophet.</font>

201
00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:38,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">It can't be. Harry Potter?</font>

202
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:41,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry Potter!</font>

203
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:42,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me, madam.</font>

204
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:48,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice big smile, Harry.
Together, you and I rate the front page.</font>

205
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:52,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ladies and gentlemen,
what an extraordinary moment this is.</font>

206
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">When young Harry stepped
into Flourish and Blotts this morning . . .</font>

207
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:59,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . to purchase my autobiography,
Magical Me . . .</font>

in fact, be leaving . . .</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . with my entire collected works . . .</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . free of charge.</font>

213
00:19:27,089 --> 00:19:29,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, ladies?</font>

214
00:19:29,549 --> 00:19:32,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry, now you give me those,
and I'll get them signed.</font>

215
00:19:32,849 --> 00:19:36,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">All of you wait outside.
That's it.</font>

216
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:48,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll bet you loved that,
didn't you, Potter?</font>

217
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:52,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Famous Harry Potter. Can't go into a
bookshop without making the front page.</font>

218
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:55,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leave him alone.</font>

219
00:19:55,329 --> 00:19:58,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, Potter.
You've got yourself a girlfriend.</font>

220
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, now, Draco, play nicely.</font>

221
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Potter.</font>

222
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:11,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lucius Malfoy. We meet at last.</font>

223
00:20:11,259 --> 00:20:13,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forgive me.</font>

224
00:20:14,849 --> 00:20:16,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your scar is legend.</font>

225
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:19,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">As, of course, is the wizard
who gave it to you.</font>

226
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:22,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Voldemort killed my parents.</font>

227
00:20:24,269 --> 00:20:27,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was nothing more than a murderer.</font>

228
00:20:28,779 --> 00:20:31,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must be very brave
to mention his name.</font>

229
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:33,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or very foolish.</font>

230
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:37,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fear of a name only increases
fear of the thing itself.</font>

231
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:42,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you must be Miss Granger.</font>

232
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:49,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, Draco has told me
all about you. And your parents.</font>

233
00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:57,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Muggles, aren't they?</font>

234
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:05,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me see.
Red hair, vacant expressions . . .</font>

235
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:10,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . tatty, secondhand book.</font>

236
00:21:10,779 --> 00:21:14,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must be the Weasleys.</font>

237
00:21:14,569 --> 00:21:16,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's mad in here.
Let's go outside.</font>

238
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:20,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, well, well. Weasley senior.
- Lucius.</font>

239
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:25,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Busy time at the Ministry, Arthur,
all those extra raids?</font>

240
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do hope they're paying you overtime . . .</font>

241
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . but judging by the state of this,
I'd say not.</font>

242
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:36,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the use in being a disgrace
to the name of wizard . . .</font>

243
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:38,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . if they don't even pay you well for it?</font>

244
00:21:39,269 --> 00:21:44,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have a very different idea about what
disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy.</font>

245
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:46,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clearly.</font>

246
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Associating with Muggles.</font>

247
00:21:56,319 --> 00:22:00,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I thought your family
could sink no lower.</font>

248
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:07,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll see you at work.</font>

249
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:13,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">See you at school.</font>

250
00:22:21,349 --> 00:22:24,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">- 10:58, come on.
- The train will be leaving any moment.</font>

251
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:27,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fred, George, Percy, you first.</font>

252
00:22:33,069 --> 00:22:34,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

253
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">After you, dear.</font>

254
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:47,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, Ginny,
we'll get you a seat. Hurry.</font>

255
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:51,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go.</font>

256
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:08,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What do you two think you're doing?
- Sorry.</font>

257
00:23:08,769 --> 00:23:11,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lost control of the trolley.</font>

258
00:23:13,109 --> 00:23:15,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why can't we get through?
- I don't know.</font>

259
00:23:15,609 --> 00:23:18,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">The gateway has sealed
itself for some reason.</font>

260
00:23:20,369 --> 00:23:24,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">The train leaves at exactly 1 1 :00.
We've missed it.</font>

261
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:27,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry, if we can't get through . . .</font>

262
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:30,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . maybe Mum and Dad can't get back.</font>

263
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:35,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe we should just go
and wait by the car.</font>

264
00:23:36,259 --> 00:23:37,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">The car.</font>

265
00:23:49,099 --> 00:23:51,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ron, I should tell you . . .</font>

266
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . most Muggles aren't accustomed
to seeing a flying car.</font>

267
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right.</font>

268
00:23:56,779 --> 00:23:57,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

269
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:18,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no! The lnvisibility Booster
must be faulty.</font>

270
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, then. Let's go lower.
We need to find the train.</font>

271
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

272
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">All we need to do is catch up
with the train.</font>

273
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:38,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't be far behind.</font>

274
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:42,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do you hear that?
- We must be getting close.</font>

275
00:24:43,369 --> 00:24:45,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold on.</font>

276
00:25:11,849 --> 00:25:14,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry!</font>

277
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:18,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold on!</font>

278
00:25:21,819 --> 00:25:24,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take my hand!</font>

279
00:25:28,579 --> 00:25:29,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold on!</font>

280
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm trying. Your hand's all sweaty.</font>

281
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:49,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I think we found the train.
- Yeah.</font>

282
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome home.</font>

283
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:24,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Up! Up!</font>

284
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not working!</font>

285
00:26:31,809 --> 00:26:34,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">Up! Ron, mind that tree!</font>

286
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:39,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop! Stop! Stop!</font>

287
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">- My wand. Look at my wand.
- Be thankful it's not your neck.</font>

288
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:12,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's happening?
- I don't know.</font>

289
00:27:47,589 --> 00:27:49,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, go! Fast!</font>

290
00:28:24,089 --> 00:28:26,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Scabbers, you're okay.</font>

291
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">The car!</font>

292
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dad's gonna kill me.</font>

293
00:28:56,289 --> 00:28:58,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">See you, Hedwig.</font>

294
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">So a house-elf shows up
in my bedroom . . .</font>

295
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:05,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . we can't get through the barrier
to platform 93/4 . . .</font>

296
00:29:05,589 --> 00:29:08,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . we almost get killed by a tree . . . .</font>

297
00:29:09,009 --> 00:29:12,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clearly someone doesn't want me
here this year.</font>

298
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:19,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, take a good look, lads.</font>

299
00:29:19,269 --> 00:29:23,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">This night might well be
the last you spend in this castle.</font>

300
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:29,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, dear, we are in trouble.</font>

301
00:29:29,779 --> 00:29:35,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were seen by no less
than seven Muggles.</font>

302
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:39,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you have any idea
how serious this is?</font>

303
00:29:39,869 --> 00:29:43,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have risked
the exposure of our world.</font>

304
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:47,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not to mention the damage you
inflicted on a Whomping Willow . . .</font>

305
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:50,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . that's been on these grounds
since before you were born.</font>

306
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:54,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Honestly, Professor Snape,
I think it did more damage to us.</font>

307
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:55,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Silence.</font>

308
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:04,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">I assure you that were you in Slytherin,
and your fate rested with me . . .</font>

309
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:08,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . the both of you would be
on the train home tonight.</font>

310
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">- As it is—
- They are not.</font>

311
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:17,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Dumbledore.
Professor McGonagall.</font>

312
00:30:18,369 --> 00:30:19,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Headmaster . . .</font>

313
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:24,829

for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry.</font>

314
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">- As such—
- I am well aware of our bylaws . . .</font>

315
00:30:29,089 --> 00:30:31,960

quite a few of them myself.</font>

316
00:30:32,339 --> 00:30:35,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">However, as head of Gryffindor house . . .</font>

317
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:40,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . it is for Professor McGonagall
to determine the appropriate action.</font>

318
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:43,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll go and get our stuff, then.</font>

319
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:45,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you
talking about, Mr. Weasley?</font>

320
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:48,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're going to expel us, aren't you?</font>

321
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:53,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not today, Mr. Weasley . . .</font>

322
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:58,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . but I must impress on both of you
the seriousness of what you have done.</font>

323
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:03,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will be writing to your families tonight,
and you will both receive detention.</font>

324
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:30,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Morning, everyone.</font>

325
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:33,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Good morning, everyone.
- Good morning, Professor Sprout.</font>

326
00:31:33,609 --> 00:31:37,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome to Greenhouse Three,
second years. Gather around, everyone.</font>

327
00:31:38,069 --> 00:31:40,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">Today we're going to re-pot Mandrakes.</font>

328
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:45,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who here can tell me
the properties of the Mandrake root?</font>

329
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:47,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, Miss Granger?</font>

330
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:49,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mandrake, or Mandragora . . .</font>

Petrified to their original state.</font>

332
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:59,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's also dangerous. The Mandrake's
cry is fatal to anyone who hears it.</font>

333
00:32:00,089 --> 00:32:02,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor.</font>

334
00:32:03,099 --> 00:32:05,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">As our Mandrakes
are still only seedlings . . .</font>

335
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:07,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . their cries won't kill you yet.</font>

336
00:32:08,019 --> 00:32:11,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">But they could knock you out for hours,
which is why I have given you earmuffs . . .</font>

337
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . for auditory protection.</font>

338
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:18,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">So could you please put them on,
right away? Quickly.</font>

339
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:21,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Flaps tight down,
and watch me closely.</font>

340
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">You grasp your Mandrake firmly.</font>

341
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:27,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">You pull it sharply up out of the pot.</font>

342
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:33,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got it? And . . .</font>

343
00:32:33,789 --> 00:32:35,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . now you dunk it down
into the other pot . . .</font>

344
00:32:36,089 --> 00:32:40,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . and pour a little sprinkling of soil
to keep him warm.</font>

345
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:47,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Longbottom's been neglecting
his earmuffs.</font>

346
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:52,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, ma'am, he's just fainted.
- Yes, well, just leave him there.</font>

347
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right, on we go.
Plenty of pots to go around.</font>

348
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:59,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grasp your Mandrake and pull it up.</font>

349
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:18,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">- There's Nearly Headless Nick.
- Hello, Percy, Miss Clearwater.</font>

350
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:21,220

351
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:35,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say it. I'm doomed.</font>

352
00:33:36,819 --> 00:33:38,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're doomed.
- Hi, Harry.</font>

353
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:43,700

354
00:33:43,859 --> 00:33:45,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, Colin. Nice to meet you.</font>

355
00:33:46,029 --> 00:33:47,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ron, is that your owl?</font>

356
00:34:02,589 --> 00:34:05,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bloody bird's a menace.</font>

357
00:34:09,469 --> 00:34:10,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no.</font>

358
00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:14,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, everyone.
Weasley's got himself a Howler.</font>

359
00:34:16,059 --> 00:34:21,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on, Ron. I ignored one
from my gran once. It was horrible.</font>

360
00:34:28,489 --> 00:34:30,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ronald Weasley!</font>

361
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:39,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">How dare you steal that car!
I am absolutely disgusted!</font>

362
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:41,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your father's now facing
an inquiry at work...</font>

363
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:44,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it's entirely your fault!</font>

364
00:34:44,969 --> 00:34:48,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you put another toe out of line...</font>

365
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:52,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">we'll bring you straight home!</font>

366
00:34:53,059 --> 00:34:56,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, Ginny, dear, congratulations
on making Gryffindor.</font>

367
00:34:56,730 --> 00:35:00,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your father and I are so proud.</font>

368
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:25,130

<font color="#FFFFFF">But I don't talk about that.</font>

376
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:52,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't get rid of the Bandon Banshee
by smiling at him.</font>

377
00:35:56,159 --> 00:35:59,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, be warned.</font>

378
00:35:59,289 --> 00:36:01,340

380

<font color="#FFFFFF">You may find yourselves facing
your worst fears in this room.</font>

381
00:36:11,429 --> 00:36:15,469

can befall you whilst I am here.</font>

382
00:36:15,639 --> 00:36:18,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">I must ask you not to scream.</font>

383
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:21,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">It might provoke them.</font>

384
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cornish pixies?</font>

385
00:36:26,489 --> 00:36:29,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Freshly caught Cornish pixies.</font>

386
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,449

devilishly tricky little blighters.</font>

388
00:36:36,949 --> 00:36:39,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's see what you make of them.</font>

389
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:47,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on now, round them up.
They're only pixies.</font>

390
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:07,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You just stay there!
- Please, get me down!</font>

391

the rest of them back into their cage.</font>

394
00:37:43,019 --> 00:37:45,190

395
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:48,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Immobulus!</font>

396
00:37:57,659 --> 00:37:59,909

397
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">I spent the summer devising

harder and longer.</font>

399
00:38:12,969 --> 00:38:16,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">What—? I don't believe it.</font>

400
00:38:19,059 --> 00:38:21,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where you think you're going, Flint?
- Quidditch practice.</font>

401

- Easy, Wood. I've got a note.</font>

405
00:38:37,909 --> 00:38:40,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've got a new Seeker. Who?</font>

406
00:38:44,539 --> 00:38:47,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Malfoy?
- That's right.</font>

407
00:38:47,329 --> 00:38:50,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's not all
that's new this year.</font>

408
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those are Nimbus 2001 s.
How did you get those?</font>

409
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:56,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">A gift from Draco's father.</font>

410
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see, Weasley, unlike some,
my father can afford the best.</font>

411
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:03,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">At least no one on the Gryffindor team
had to buy their way in.</font>

412
00:39:03,889 --> 00:39:06,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">They got in on pure talent.</font>

413
00:39:10,019 --> 00:39:13,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one asked your opinion,
you filthy little Mudblood.</font>

414
00:39:16,409 --> 00:39:19,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll pay for that one, Malfoy.
Eat slugs!</font>

415
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">You okay, Ron?</font>

416
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say something.</font>

417
00:39:40,349 --> 00:39:44,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Wow! Can you turn him around, Harry?
- No, Colin, get out of the way.</font>

418
00:39:45,769 --> 00:39:47,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's take him to Hagrid's.</font>

419
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:50,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll know what to do.</font>

420
00:39:58,989 --> 00:40:02,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">This calls for
a specialist's equipment.</font>

421
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:09,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing to do but wait till it stops,
I'm afraid.</font>

422
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:13,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay.
- Better out than in.</font>

423
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:19,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who was Ron trying to curse, anyway?
- Malfoy. He called Hermione . . . .</font>

424
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:24,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I don't know
exactly what it means.</font>

425
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:30,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">He called me a Mudblood.</font>

426
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:33,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He did not.
- What's a Mudblood?</font>

427
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:38,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">It means "dirty blood. " Mudblood's a foul
name for someone who's Muggle-born.</font>

428
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:42,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone with non-magic parents.
Someone like me.</font>

429
00:40:42,949 --> 00:40:47,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not a term one usually hears
in civilized conversation.</font>

430
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:53,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, the thing is, Harry, there are
some wizards, like the Malfoy family . . .</font>

431

00:40:58,050 --> 00:40:59,679

433
00:41:02,679 --> 00:41:04,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's disgusting.</font>

434
00:41:04,179 --> 00:41:07,679

Dirty blood.</font>

00:41:19,449 --> 00:41:25,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you think on it, Hermione.
Don't you think on it for one minute.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Not really.</font>

444
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:53,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fame is a fickle friend, Harry.
Celebrity is as celebrity does.</font>

445
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:56,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember that.</font>

446
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,989

- Sorry?</font>

450
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">That voice.</font>

451

00:42:23,719 --> 00:42:28,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Didn't you hear it?
- What are you talking about, Harry?</font>

453
00:42:28,969 --> 00:42:32,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you're getting
a bit drowsy.</font>

454
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:36,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">And great Scott, no wonder. Look at the
time. We've been here nearly four hours.</font>

455
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:40,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Spooky how the time flies

459
00:42:57,039 --> 00:43:00,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me rip you.</font>

460
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:03,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me kill you.</font>

461
00:43:05,719 --> 00:43:07,179

465
00:43:14,889 --> 00:43:18,309

466
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,440

And then again just—</font>

467

<font color="#FFFFFF">It's time.</font>

468
00:43:24,989 --> 00:43:28,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's moving.
I think it's going to kill.</font>

469
00:43:29,159 --> 00:43:33,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Kill?
- Harry, wait! Not so fast!</font>

470
00:43:58,690 --> 00:44:00,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Strange.</font>

471
00:44:01,269 --> 00:44:05,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I've never seen spiders act like that.
- I don't like spiders.</font>

472
00:44:09,909 --> 00:44:11,949

473
00:44:15,409 --> 00:44:19,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">"The Chamber of Secrets has been
opened. Enemies of the Heir, beware. "</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no.</font>

476
00:44:32,179 --> 00:44:34,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Filch's cat.</font>

477
00:44:34,969 --> 00:44:37,269

<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you . . .?</font>

483
00:45:14,179 --> 00:45:16,469

492
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:55,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's not dead, Argus.
She has been Petrified.</font>

493
00:45:55,679 --> 00:45:58,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thought so.
So unlucky I wasn't there.</font>

494
00:45:58,679 --> 00:46:01,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know exactly the countercurse

I cannot say.</font>

496
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:09,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ask him.
It's him that's done it.</font>

497
00:46:09,989 --> 00:46:12,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">You saw what he wrote on the wall.</font>

498
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:16,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not true, sir. I swear.
I never touched Mrs. Norris.</font>

499
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:21,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Rubbish.
- if I might, headmaster?</font>

500
00:46:22,039 --> 00:46:26,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps Potter and his friends were just
in the wrong place at the wrong time.</font>

501
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:29,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">However . . .</font>

502
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:32,550

504
00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:39,769

505
00:46:39,929 --> 00:46:43,349

answer my fan mail.</font>

506
00:46:43,519 --> 00:46:46,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why Ron and l
went looking for him, professor.</font>

507
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:49,730

has a very healthy growth of Mandrake.</font>

517
00:47:46,329 --> 00:47:49,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's a bit strange, isn't it?
- Strange?</font>

518
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:52,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">You hear this voice,
a voice only you can hear . . .</font>

519
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:57,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . and then Mrs. Norris turns up
Petrified. It's just strange.</font>

520
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:01,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think I should have told them?
Dumbledore and the others, I mean?</font>

521
00:48:01,179 --> 00:48:02,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you mad?</font>

522
00:48:02,809 --> 00:48:08,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world,
hearing voices isn't a good sign.</font>

523
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's right, you know.</font>

524
00:48:17,110 --> 00:48:19,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could I have your attention,
please?</font>

525
00:48:19,989 --> 00:48:25,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right. Now, today,
we will be transforming animals . . .</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . into water goblets.</font>

527
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,630

<font color="#FFFFFF">One, two, three.
Vera Verto.</font>

529
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:43,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now it's your turn.
Who would like to go first?</font>

530
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:48,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Weasley.
"One, two, three. Vera Verto. "</font>

531
00:48:52,309 --> 00:48:54,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Vera Verto!</font>

532
00:49:00,530 --> 00:49:03,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">That wand needs replacing,
Mr. Weasley.</font>

533
00:49:04,539 --> 00:49:06,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes, Miss Granger?
- Professor . . .</font>

534
00:49:06,869 --> 00:49:11,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . .l was wondering if you could tell us
about the Chamber of Secrets.</font>

535
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:18,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very well.</font>

536
00:49:20,010 --> 00:49:22,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">You all know, of course . . .</font>

537
00:49:22,179 --> 00:49:26,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . that Hogwarts was founded
over a thousand years ago . . .</font>

538
00:49:26,219 --> 00:49:30,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . by the four greatest witches
and wizards of the age:</font>

539
00:49:30,809 --> 00:49:34,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Godric Gryffindor,
Helga Hufflepuff . . .</font>

540
00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:40,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . Rowena Ravenclaw
and Salazar Slytherin.</font>

541
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:47,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, three of the founders
coexisted quite harmoniously.</font>

542
00:49:47,199 --> 00:49:50,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">- One did not.
- Three guesses who.</font>

543
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:53,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Salazar Slytherin wished to be
more selective . . .</font>

544
00:49:53,579 --> 00:49:56,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . about the students admitted
to Hogwarts.</font>

545
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:01,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">He believed magical learning should
be kept within all-magic families.</font>

546
00:50:01,679 --> 00:50:03,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">In other words, pure-bloods.</font>

547
00:50:04,179 --> 00:50:09,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unable to sway the others,
he decided to leave the school.</font>

548
00:50:10,349 --> 00:50:12,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, according to legend . . .</font>

549
00:50:12,769 --> 00:50:16,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . Slytherin had built
a hidden chamber in this castle . . .</font>

550
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:20,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . known as the Chamber of Secrets.</font>

551
00:50:20,489 --> 00:50:24,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Though, shortly before departing,
he sealed it . . .</font>

552
00:50:25,070 --> 00:50:29,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . until that time when his own
true Heir returned to the school.</font>

553
00:50:29,369 --> 00:50:31,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Heir alone . . .</font>

554
00:50:31,909 --> 00:50:34,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . would be able to open the Chamber . . .</font>

555
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:39,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . and unleash the horror within,
and by so doing . . .</font>

556
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:43,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . purge the school
of all those who . . .</font>

557
00:50:43,219 --> 00:50:48,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . in Slytherin's view,
were unworthy to study magic.</font>

558
00:50:48,849 --> 00:50:50,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Muggle-borns.</font>

559
00:50:52,019 --> 00:50:55,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Naturally, the school
has been searched many times.</font>

560
00:50:55,809 --> 00:50:59,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">No such chamber has been found.</font>

561
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:04,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor? What exactly does legend
tell us lies within the Chamber?</font>

562
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:07,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Chamber is said to be home
to something . . .</font>

563
00:51:08,119 --> 00:51:11,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . that only the Heir of Slytherin
can control.</font>

564
00:51:12,329 --> 00:51:15,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is said to be the home . . .</font>

565
00:51:16,130 --> 00:51:17,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . of a monster.</font>

566
00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:27,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think it's true? Do you think
there really is a Chamber of Secrets?</font>

567
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:31,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. Couldn't you tell? McGonagall's
worried. All the teachers are.</font>

568
00:51:31,719 --> 00:51:35,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">if there really is a Chamber of Secrets,
and it has been opened, that means—</font>

569
00:51:35,730 --> 00:51:39,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Heir of Slytherin has returned
to Hogwarts. The question is, who is it?</font>

570
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:44,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's think. Who do we know who
thinks all Muggle-borns are scum?</font>

571
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:47,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">- if you're talking about Malfoy—
- Of course. You heard him.</font>

572
00:51:47,239 --> 00:51:48,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">"You'll be next, Mudbloods. "</font>

573
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:51,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard him.
But Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?</font>

574
00:51:51,909 --> 00:51:55,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe Ron's right, Hermione.
I mean, look at his family.</font>

575
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:58,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">The whole lot of them have been
in Slytherin for centuries.</font>

576
00:51:58,210 --> 00:52:01,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Crabbe and Goyle must know.
Maybe we could trick them into telling.</font>

577
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:06,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even they aren't that thick.
But there might be another way.</font>

578
00:52:06,429 --> 00:52:08,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mind you, it would be difficult.</font>

579
00:52:08,429 --> 00:52:11,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not to mention we'd be breaking
about 50 school rules . . .</font>

580
00:52:11,639 --> 00:52:16,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . and it'll be dangerous.
Very dangerous.</font>

581
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:25,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here it is.
The Polyjuice Potion.</font>

582
00:52:25,570 --> 00:52:28,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion
allows the drinker . . .</font>

583
00:52:28,449 --> 00:52:32,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . to transform himself temporarily
into the physical form of another. "</font>

584
00:52:32,869 --> 00:52:36,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">You mean if Harry and I drink that stuff,
we'll turn into Crabbe and Goyle?</font>

585
00:52:36,829 --> 00:52:40,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Wicked! Malfoy will tell us anything.
- Exactly.</font>

586
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:44,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it's tricky. I've never seen
a more complicated potion.</font>

587
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:47,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How long will it take to make?
- A month.</font>

588
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:49,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">A month?</font>

589
00:52:49,510 --> 00:52:53,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, Hermione,
if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin . . .</font>

590
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:56,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . he could attack half
the Muggle-borns in the school by then.</font>

591
00:52:56,889 --> 00:52:58,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know.</font>

592
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:01,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it's the only plan we've got.</font>

593
00:53:51,489 --> 00:53:54,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Another goal for Slytherin!</font>

594
00:53:55,619 --> 00:53:58,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">They lead Gryffindor 90 to 30.</font>

595
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:01,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah!</font>

596
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah!</font>

597
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:30,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right there, Scarhead?</font>

598
00:54:36,409 --> 00:54:38,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Watch yourself, Harry!</font>

599
00:54:39,289 --> 00:54:41,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wood, look out!</font>

600
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:57,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blimey! Harry's got himself
a rogue Bludger.</font>

601
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's been tampered with, that has.</font>

602
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:01,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll stop it.</font>

603
00:55:01,769 --> 00:55:06,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! Even with a proper wand,
it's too risky. You could hit Harry.</font>

604
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:34,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Training for the ballet, Potter?</font>

605
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll never catch me, Potter.</font>

606
00:57:38,010 --> 00:57:39,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go.</font>

607
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:44,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry Potter has caught the Snitch.
Gryffindor wins!</font>

608
00:57:50,769 --> 00:57:52,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Finite Incantatem!</font>

609
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:01,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thank you.
- Are you okay?</font>

610
00:58:01,409 --> 00:58:03,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. I think my arm is broken.</font>

611
00:58:03,659 --> 00:58:07,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not to worry, Harry. I will fix
that arm of yours straightaway.</font>

612
00:58:07,619 --> 00:58:10,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Not you.
- Boy doesn't know what he's saying.</font>

613
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:14,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">This won't hurt a bit.</font>

614
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:23,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brackium Emendo!</font>

615
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:34,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, well,
that can sometimes happen . . .</font>

616
00:58:34,690 --> 00:58:36,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . but the point is . . .</font>

617
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:42,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . you can no longer feel any pain, and,
very clearly, the bones are not broken.</font>

618
00:58:42,610 --> 00:58:45,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Broken? There's no bones left.</font>

619
00:58:46,989 --> 00:58:48,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Much more flexible, though.</font>

620
00:58:51,409 --> 00:58:55,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Malfoy, stop making such a fuss.
You can go. Out of my way.</font>

621
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:57,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should have been brought
straight to me.</font>

622
00:58:57,630 --> 00:59:00,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can mend bones in a heartbeat,
but growing them back . . . .</font>

623
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:01,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will be able to, won't you?</font>

624
00:59:02,010 --> 00:59:05,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll be able to, certainly.
But it'll be painful.</font>

625
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:10,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're in for a rough night, Potter.
Regrowing bones is a nasty business.</font>

626
00:59:13,349 --> 00:59:16,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you expect?
Pumpkin juice?</font>

627
00:59:22,989 --> 00:59:24,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kill.</font>

628
00:59:25,570 --> 00:59:27,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kill.</font>

629
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:35,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Time to kill.</font>

630
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:42,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello.</font>

631
00:59:44,679 --> 00:59:45,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dobby?</font>

632
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:48,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry Potter should have listened
to Dobby.</font>

633
00:59:48,679 --> 00:59:52,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry Potter should have gone back home
when he missed the train.</font>

634
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:57,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was you. You stopped the barrier
from letting Ron and me through.</font>

635
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:00,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">lndeed. Yes, sir.</font>

636
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:06,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You nearly got Ron and me expelled.
- At least you would be away from here.</font>

637
01:00:06,659 --> 01:00:09,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry Potter must go home.</font>

638
01:00:09,489 --> 01:00:13,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dobby thought his Bludger would be
enough to make Harry Potter see—</font>

639
01:00:13,250 --> 01:00:16,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your Bludger? You made
that Bludger chase after me?</font>

640
01:00:16,789 --> 01:00:20,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dobby feels most aggrieved, sir.</font>

641
01:00:20,539 --> 01:00:24,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dobby had to iron his hands.</font>

642
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:30,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">You better clear off before my bones
come back, or I might strangle you.</font>

643
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:35,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dobby is used to death threats, sir.</font>

644
01:00:35,769 --> 01:00:38,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dobby gets them five times a day
at home.</font>

645
01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:41,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't suppose you could tell me
why you're trying to kill me?</font>

646
01:00:42,070 --> 01:00:45,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not kill you, sir.
Never kill you.</font>

647
01:00:46,110 --> 01:00:49,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dobby remembers how it was
before Harry Potter triumphed . . .</font>

648
01:00:49,619 --> 01:00:52,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.</font>

649
01:00:52,909 --> 01:00:56,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">We house-elves were
treated like vermin, sir.</font>

650
01:00:56,789 --> 01:01:02,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course, Dobby is still
treated like vermin.</font>

651
01:01:11,550 --> 01:01:14,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you wear that thing, Dobby?</font>

652
01:01:14,349 --> 01:01:19,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">This, sir? It is a mark
of the house-elf's enslavement.</font>

653
01:01:19,650 --> 01:01:24,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dobby can only be freed if his master
presents him with clothes.</font>

654
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:28,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen.</font>

655
01:01:28,449 --> 01:01:29,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen!</font>

656
01:01:30,159 --> 01:01:33,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Terrible things are
about to happen at Hogwarts.</font>

657
01:01:34,489 --> 01:01:36,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry Potter must not stay here . . .</font>

658
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:41,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . now that history
is to repeat itself.</font>

659
01:01:41,829 --> 01:01:45,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Repeat itself? You mean
this has happened before?</font>

660
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:47,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">I shouldn't have said that.</font>

661
01:01:51,179 --> 01:01:54,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Bad Dobby! Bad!
- Stop it!</font>

662
01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:56,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop it, Dobby!</font>

663
01:01:57,849 --> 01:02:01,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me. When did this happen before?
Who's doing it now?</font>

664
01:02:01,849 --> 01:02:07,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dobby cannot say, sir. Dobby
only wants Harry Potter to be safe.</font>

665
01:02:07,230 --> 01:02:10,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Dobby. Tell me.
Who is it?</font>

666
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put him here.</font>

667
01:02:27,670 --> 01:02:30,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What happened?
- There's been another attack.</font>

668
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:36,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think he's been Petrified,
Madam Pomfrey.</font>

669
01:02:37,349 --> 01:02:42,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look. Perhaps he managed
to take a picture of his attacker.</font>

670
01:02:50,150 --> 01:02:52,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">What can this mean, Albus?</font>

671
01:02:53,070 --> 01:02:55,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">It means . . .</font>

672
01:02:55,409 --> 01:02:58,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . that our students
are in great danger.</font>

673
01:02:58,329 --> 01:03:01,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What should I tell the staff?
- The truth.</font>

674
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell them Hogwarts
is no longer safe.</font>

675
01:03:06,130 --> 01:03:09,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is as we feared, Minerva.</font>

676
01:03:09,340 --> 01:03:13,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Chamber of Secrets
has indeed been opened again.</font>

677
01:03:16,719 --> 01:03:20,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Again? You mean the Chamber
of Secrets has been opened before?</font>

678
01:03:21,019 --> 01:03:23,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course.
Don't you see?</font>

679
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:26,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lucius Malfoy must have opened it
when he was at school here.</font>

680
01:03:27,559 --> 01:03:30,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Now he's taught Draco how to do it.
- Maybe.</font>

681
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:33,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll have to wait for
the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure.</font>

682
01:03:33,650 --> 01:03:37,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enlighten me. Why are we brewing
this potion in broad daylight . . .</font>

683
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:41,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . in the middle of the girls' lavatory?
Don't you think we'll get caught?</font>

684
01:03:42,619 --> 01:03:45,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No one ever comes in here.</font>

685
01:03:46,130 --> 01:03:48,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why?
- Moaning Myrtle.</font>

686
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:50,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who?</font>

687
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:52,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Moaning Myrtle.</font>

688
01:03:53,260 --> 01:03:56,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who's Moaning Myrtle?
- I'm Moaning Myrtle.</font>

689
01:04:02,519 --> 01:04:04,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wouldn't expect you to know me.</font>

690
01:04:05,059 --> 01:04:08,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who would ever talk
about ugly, miserable . . .</font>

691
01:04:08,269 --> 01:04:11,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . moping Moaning Myrtle?</font>

692
01:04:18,869 --> 01:04:20,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's a little sensitive.</font>

693
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:27,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gather round!</font>

694
01:04:27,789 --> 01:04:32,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gather round.
Can everybody see me?</font>

695
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:36,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you all hear me?</font>

696
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:38,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excellent.</font>

697
01:04:38,590 --> 01:04:42,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">In light of the dark events
of recent weeks . . .</font>

698
01:04:42,469 --> 01:04:47,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . Professor Dumbledore has granted me
permission to start this Dueling Club . . .</font>

699
01:04:47,309 --> 01:04:51,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . to train you all up in case
you ever need to defend yourselves . . .</font>

700
01:04:52,230 --> 01:04:54,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . as I myself have done
on countless occasions.</font>

701
01:04:54,989 --> 01:04:58,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">For full details,
see my published works.</font>

702
01:05:03,369 --> 01:05:06,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me introduce my assistant . . .</font>

703
01:05:06,659 --> 01:05:09,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . Professor Snape.</font>

704
01:05:12,630 --> 01:05:15,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">He has sportingly agreed to help
with a short demonstration.</font>

705
01:05:15,590 --> 01:05:17,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want any of you
youngsters to worry.</font>

706
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:22,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll still have your Potions master
when I'm through with him. Never fear.</font>

707
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:39,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">One.</font>

708
01:05:40,159 --> 01:05:41,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two.</font>

709
01:05:41,989 --> 01:05:45,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Three!
- Expelliarmus!</font>

710
01:05:53,630 --> 01:05:56,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do you think he's all right?
- Who cares?</font>

711
01:05:56,460 --> 01:05:59,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">An excellent idea to show them that,
Professor Snape . . .</font>

712
01:05:59,590 --> 01:06:04,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . but if you don't mind me saying, it was
obvious what you were about to do.</font>

713
01:06:04,309 --> 01:06:07,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">if I had wanted to stop you,
it would have been only too easy.</font>

714
01:06:07,730 --> 01:06:11,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps it would be prudent
to first teach the students . . .</font>

715
01:06:11,349 --> 01:06:15,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . to block unfriendly spells,
professor.</font>

716
01:06:17,610 --> 01:06:20,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">An excellent suggestion,
Professor Snape.</font>

717
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:25,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's have a volunteer pair.
Potter, Weasley, how about you?</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll be sending Potter
to the hospital wing in a matchbox.</font>

720
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:37,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Might I suggest someone
from my own house?</font>

721
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:41,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Malfoy, perhaps?</font>

722
01:06:48,849 --> 01:06:51,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Good luck, Potter.
- Thank you, sir.</font>

723
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:01,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wands at the ready.</font>

724
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:04,909

- You wish.</font>

725

your opponent. Only to disarm.</font>

727
01:07:21,719 --> 01:07:25,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't want any accidents here.
One.</font>

728
01:07:27,050 --> 01:07:29,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Two.

730
01:07:54,460 --> 01:07:56,250

732
01:08:07,090 --> 01:08:09,889

I'll get rid of it for you.</font>

736
01:09:22,539 --> 01:09:25,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a Parselmouth?
Why didn't you tell us?</font>

737
01:09:25,420 --> 01:09:27,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm a what?
- You can talk to snakes.</font>

738
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:33,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know. I accidentally set a python
on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once.</font>

739
01:09:33,350 --> 01:09:37,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once. But so what?
I bet loads of people here can do it.</font>

740
01:09:37,479 --> 01:09:41,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, they can't.
It's not a very common gift, Harry.</font>

741
01:09:41,729 --> 01:09:43,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is bad.</font>

742
01:09:43,609 --> 01:09:47,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's bad? if I hadn't told
that snake not to attack Justin—</font>

743
01:09:47,529 --> 01:09:50,989

744
01:09:51,159 --> 01:09:55,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard you speaking Parseltongue.
Snake language.</font>

745
01:09:55,199 --> 01:09:58,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">I spoke a different language?</font>

746
01:09:59,159 --> 01:10:01,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I didn't realize—</font>

747
01:10:01,710 --> 01:10:04,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">How can I speak a language
without knowing I can?</font>

748
01:10:04,670 --> 01:10:08,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know, but it sounded like you
were egging the snake on or something.</font>

749
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:10,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry, listen to me.</font>

750
01:10:10,970 --> 01:10:13,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a reason the symbol
of Slytherin house is a serpent.</font>

751
01:10:14,010 --> 01:10:18,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth.
He could talk to snakes too.</font>

752
01:10:18,770 --> 01:10:19,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">Exactly.</font>

753
01:10:19,979 --> 01:10:23,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now the whole school's gonna think
you're his great-great-great grandson.</font>

754
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:25,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I'm not.</font>

755
01:10:28,239 --> 01:10:30,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't be.</font>

756
01:10:31,319 --> 01:10:33,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">He lived a thousand years ago.</font>

757
01:10:33,529 --> 01:10:36,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">For all we know, you could be.</font>

758
01:11:06,859 --> 01:11:09,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll see you back in the common room.</font>

759
01:11:25,630 --> 01:11:29,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want blood.</font>

760
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:37,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">They all must die.</font>

761
01:11:38,390 --> 01:11:40,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kill.</font>

762
01:11:41,060 --> 01:11:43,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kill.</font>

763
01:11:43,939 --> 01:11:46,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kill.</font>

764
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:50,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Time to kill.</font>

765
01:12:24,810 --> 01:12:26,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">Caught in the act.</font>

766
01:12:26,899 --> 01:12:28,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll have you out this time, Potter.</font>

767
01:12:29,359 --> 01:12:31,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mark my words.</font>

768
01:12:32,029 --> 01:12:36,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Mr. Filch! You don't understand—</font>

769
01:13:03,020 --> 01:13:04,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor . . .</font>

770
01:13:05,140 --> 01:13:06,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . .l swear I didn't.</font>

771
01:13:06,729 --> 01:13:09,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is out of my hands, Potter.</font>

772
01:13:19,569 --> 01:13:22,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Dumbledore
will be waiting for you.</font>

773
01:13:31,170 --> 01:13:33,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sherbet Lemon.</font>

774
01:14:07,710 --> 01:14:09,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Dumbledore?</font>

775
01:14:26,310 --> 01:14:29,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bee in your bonnet, Potter?</font>

776
01:14:31,899 --> 01:14:36,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was just wondering
if you put me in the right house.</font>

777
01:14:36,609 --> 01:14:42,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. You were particularly
difficult to place.</font>

778
01:14:42,239 --> 01:14:45,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I stand by what I said last year.</font>

779
01:14:45,949 --> 01:14:49,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">You would have done well in Slytherin.</font>

780
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:50,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're wrong.</font>

781
01:15:20,109 --> 01:15:21,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry?</font>

782
01:15:21,899 --> 01:15:24,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor.</font>

783
01:15:24,319 --> 01:15:28,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your bird . . . .
There was nothing I could do.</font>

784
01:15:28,699 --> 01:15:32,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He just caught fire.
- And about time too.</font>

785
01:15:32,869 --> 01:15:35,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's been looking dreadful for days.</font>

786
01:15:35,380 --> 01:15:37,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pity you had to see him
on a burning day.</font>

787
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:42,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry.</font>

788
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:46,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">They burst into flame
when it is time for them to die . . .</font>

789
01:15:46,220 --> 01:15:48,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . and then they are . . .</font>

790
01:15:48,510 --> 01:15:51,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . reborn from the ashes.</font>

791
01:15:59,939 --> 01:16:02,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fascinating creatures, phoenixes.</font>

792
01:16:03,029 --> 01:16:06,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">They can carry immensely heavy loads.</font>

793
01:16:07,069 --> 01:16:09,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Their tears have healing powers.</font>

794
01:16:12,539 --> 01:16:15,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Dumbledore, sir!
Wait! Listen!</font>

795
01:16:16,579 --> 01:16:18,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Dumbledore, sir,
it wasn't Harry.</font>

796
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:22,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd be prepared to swear it
in front of the Ministry of Magic.</font>

797
01:16:24,220 --> 01:16:26,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Relax.</font>

798
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:28,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do not believe . . .</font>

799
01:16:28,970 --> 01:16:32,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">- . . . that Harry attacked anyone.
- Of course you don't.</font>

800
01:16:36,229 --> 01:16:38,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right. Well, I'll . . . .</font>

801
01:16:38,979 --> 01:16:42,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'll just wait outside, then.
- Yes.</font>

802
01:16:45,779 --> 01:16:49,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You don't think it was me, professor?
- No, Harry.</font>

803
01:16:49,619 --> 01:16:52,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do not think it was you.</font>

804
01:16:53,159 --> 01:16:54,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I must ask you . . .</font>

805
01:16:55,539 --> 01:16:59,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . is there something
you wish to tell me?</font>

806
01:17:06,090 --> 01:17:08,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, sir.</font>

807
01:17:08,180 --> 01:17:09,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing.</font>

808
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:14,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very well, then.</font>

809
01:17:15,020 --> 01:17:16,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">Off you go.</font>

810
01:17:54,770 --> 01:17:58,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything's set. We just need a bit
of who you're changing into.</font>

811
01:17:58,479 --> 01:18:00,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">Crabbe and Goyle.</font>

812
01:18:00,350 --> 01:18:03,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">We also need to make sure
that the real Crabbe and Goyle . . .</font>

813
01:18:03,319 --> 01:18:06,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . can't burst in on us
while we're interrogating Malfoy.</font>

814
01:18:06,859 --> 01:18:09,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How?
- I've got it all worked out.</font>

815
01:18:09,739 --> 01:18:12,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">I filled these
with a simple Sleeping Draught.</font>

816
01:18:12,489 --> 01:18:15,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Simple, but powerful.</font>

817
01:18:15,449 --> 01:18:17,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, once they're asleep . . .</font>

818
01:18:17,789 --> 01:18:21,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . hide them in the broomstick cupboard
and pull out a few of their hairs . . .</font>

819
01:18:21,170 --> 01:18:23,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . and put on their uniforms.</font>

820
01:18:23,210 --> 01:18:26,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Whose hair are you ripping out, then?
- I've already got mine.</font>

821
01:18:26,670 --> 01:18:29,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Millicent Bulstrode. Slytherin.</font>

822
01:18:30,010 --> 01:18:32,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got this off her robes.</font>

823
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:34,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to go check
on the Polyjuice Potion.</font>

824
01:18:35,140 --> 01:18:37,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make sure that Crabbe and Goyle
find these.</font>

825
01:18:49,989 --> 01:18:52,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ron, maybe I should do it.</font>

826
01:18:52,529 --> 01:18:54,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Right.</font>

827
01:18:56,789 --> 01:18:58,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wingardium Leviosa.</font>

828
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:10,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool.</font>

829
01:19:33,529 --> 01:19:35,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">How thick could you get?</font>

830
01:19:35,529 --> 01:19:37,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, let's get them.</font>

831
01:19:40,159 --> 01:19:44,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll have exactly one hour
before we change back into ourselves.</font>

832
01:19:52,340 --> 01:19:54,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Add the hairs.</font>

833
01:19:58,850 --> 01:20:00,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Essence of Crabbe.</font>

834
01:20:00,770 --> 01:20:02,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cheers.</font>

835
01:20:11,359 --> 01:20:13,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I'm gonna be sick.</font>

836
01:20:16,699 --> 01:20:18,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me too.</font>

837
01:21:03,409 --> 01:21:05,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry?</font>

838
01:21:05,619 --> 01:21:07,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ron.</font>

839
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:10,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bloody hell!</font>

840
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:13,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">We still sound like ourselves.</font>

841
01:21:13,340 --> 01:21:15,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need to sound more like Crabbe.</font>

842
01:21:16,260 --> 01:21:18,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Bloody hell.
- Excellent.</font>

843
01:21:18,890 --> 01:21:21,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But where's Hermione?
- l . . . .</font>

844
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:24,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think I'm going.
You go on without me.</font>

845
01:21:24,729 --> 01:21:26,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hermione, are you okay?</font>

846
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:29,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just go. You're wasting time.</font>

847
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:33,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

848
01:21:36,699 --> 01:21:40,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think the Slytherin common room's
this way.</font>

849
01:21:43,039 --> 01:21:45,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me.</font>

850
01:21:47,289 --> 01:21:49,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing d—?</font>

851
01:21:49,380 --> 01:21:51,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, what are you doing down here?</font>

852
01:21:53,380 --> 01:21:56,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">I happen to be a school prefect.</font>

853
01:21:56,260 --> 01:22:00,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">You, on the other hand, have no business
wandering the corridors at night.</font>

854
01:22:01,300 --> 01:22:03,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are your names again?</font>

855
01:22:03,310 --> 01:22:07,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm . . . .
- Crabbe, Goyle, where have you been?</font>

856
01:22:07,479 --> 01:22:10,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pigging out in the Great Hall
all this time?</font>

857
01:22:12,020 --> 01:22:14,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you wearing glasses?</font>

858
01:22:15,149 --> 01:22:17,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Reading.
- Reading?</font>

859
01:22:19,149 --> 01:22:21,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't know you could read.</font>

860
01:22:24,329 --> 01:22:26,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what are you doing down here,
Weasley?</font>

861
01:22:26,579 --> 01:22:28,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mind your attitude, Malfoy.</font>

862
01:22:37,420 --> 01:22:39,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, sit down.</font>

863
01:22:42,220 --> 01:22:46,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'd never know the Weasleys
were pure-bloods, the way they behave.</font>

864
01:22:46,270 --> 01:22:50,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're an embarrassment
to the wizarding world. All of them.</font>

865
01:22:50,939 --> 01:22:53,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's wrong with you, Crabbe?</font>

866
01:22:55,439 --> 01:22:57,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stomachache.</font>

867
01:22:59,189 --> 01:23:04,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm surprised the Daily Prophet
hasn't done a report on all these attacks.</font>

868
01:23:04,199 --> 01:23:06,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">I suppose Dumbledore
is trying to hush it all up.</font>

869
01:23:06,949 --> 01:23:09,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Father always said Dumbledore
was the worst thing . . .</font>

870
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:13,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">- . . . that ever happened to this place.
- You're wrong!</font>

871
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:21,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

872
01:23:22,130 --> 01:23:25,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think there's someone here
who's worse than Dumbledore?</font>

873
01:23:25,970 --> 01:23:28,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well? Do you?</font>

874
01:23:28,930 --> 01:23:30,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry Potter?</font>

875
01:23:37,359 --> 01:23:38,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good one, Goyle.</font>

876
01:23:38,939 --> 01:23:40,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're absolutely right.</font>

877
01:23:41,149 --> 01:23:42,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Saint Potter.</font>

878
01:23:43,989 --> 01:23:46,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">And people actually think
that he's the Heir of Slytherin?</font>

879
01:23:50,539 --> 01:23:53,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">But then you must have some idea
who's behind it all.</font>

880
01:23:53,329 --> 01:23:57,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know I don't, Goyle.
I told you yesterday.</font>

881
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many times do I have to tell you?</font>

882
01:24:01,510 --> 01:24:03,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this yours?</font>

883
01:24:07,810 --> 01:24:10,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">But my father did say this:</font>

884
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:13,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's been 50 years
since the Chamber was opened.</font>

885
01:24:13,640 --> 01:24:18,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wouldn't tell me who opened it.
Only that they were expelled.</font>

886
01:24:18,319 --> 01:24:22,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">The last time the Chamber of Secrets
was opened, a Mudblood died.</font>

887
01:24:23,149 --> 01:24:27,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">So it's only a matter of time
before one of them is killed this time.</font>

888
01:24:28,029 --> 01:24:29,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">As for me . . .</font>

889
01:24:30,039 --> 01:24:32,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . .l hope it's Granger.</font>

890
01:24:32,369 --> 01:24:34,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the matter with you two?</font>

891
01:24:34,750 --> 01:24:37,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're acting very odd.</font>

892
01:24:37,420 --> 01:24:39,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's his stomachache.</font>

893
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:41,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Calm down.</font>

894
01:24:46,050 --> 01:24:48,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Scar.</font>

895
01:24:51,640 --> 01:24:53,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hair.</font>

896
01:24:59,229 --> 01:25:01,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey! Where are you going?</font>

897
01:25:04,609 --> 01:25:05,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was close.</font>

898
01:25:06,069 --> 01:25:08,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hermione, come out.
We've got loads to tell you.</font>

899
01:25:08,659 --> 01:25:10,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go away.</font>

900
01:25:11,039 --> 01:25:14,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait till you see. It's awful.</font>

901
01:25:16,869 --> 01:25:18,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hermione?</font>

902
01:25:18,789 --> 01:25:20,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you okay?</font>

903
01:25:22,460 --> 01:25:24,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you remember me telling you . . .</font>

904
01:25:24,420 --> 01:25:27,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . that the Polyjuice Potion
was only for human transformations?</font>

905
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:31,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was cat hair I plucked off
Millicent Bulstrode's robes.</font>

906
01:25:34,270 --> 01:25:35,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at my face.</font>

907
01:25:36,939 --> 01:25:39,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at your tail.</font>

908
01:25:45,949 --> 01:25:47,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you spoken to Hermione?</font>

909
01:25:47,569 --> 01:25:50,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">She should be out of hospital
in a few days . . .</font>

910
01:25:50,279 --> 01:25:53,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . when she stops coughing up fur balls.</font>

911
01:25:57,869 --> 01:25:59,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's this?</font>

912
01:26:04,210 --> 01:26:05,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yuck!</font>

913
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:08,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like Moaning Myrtle's
flooded the bathroom.</font>

914
01:26:24,479 --> 01:26:28,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Come to throw something else at me?
- Why would I throw something at you?</font>

915
01:26:29,029 --> 01:26:33,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't ask me. Here I am,
minding my own business . . .</font>

916
01:26:33,279 --> 01:26:36,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . and someone thinks it's funny
to throw a book at me.</font>

917
01:26:37,119 --> 01:26:40,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it can't hurt if someone
throws something at you.</font>

918
01:26:40,170 --> 01:26:42,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, it'll just go
right through you.</font>

919
01:26:43,630 --> 01:26:48,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure! Let's all throw books at Myrtle
because she can't feel it.</font>

920
01:26:48,170 --> 01:26:50,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ten points
if you get it through her stomach!</font>

921
01:26:50,970 --> 01:26:54,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fifty points if it goes through her head!</font>

922
01:26:54,970 --> 01:26:59,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But who threw it at you, anyway?
- I don't know. I didn't see them.</font>

923
01:26:59,729 --> 01:27:03,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was just sitting in the U-bend,
thinking about death . . .</font>

924
01:27:04,189 --> 01:27:07,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . and it fell through the top
of my head.</font>

925
01:27:38,020 --> 01:27:40,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Tom Marvolo Riddle. "</font>

929
01:28:32,779 --> 01:28:37,949

930
01:28:38,779 --> 01:28:45,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . about the Chamber of Secrets?</font>

931
01:28:55,590 --> 01:28:57,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you . . .</font>

932
01:28:58,760 --> 01:29:01,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . tell me?</font>

933
01:30:03,329 --> 01:30:06,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me. Could you tell me
what's going on here?</font>

934
01:30:10,210 --> 01:30:12,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you Tom Riddle?</font>

935
01:30:12,710 --> 01:30:14,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, can you hear me?</font>

936
01:30:35,069 --> 01:30:36,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">Riddle!</font>

937
01:30:37,399 --> 01:30:38,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come.</font>

938
01:30:39,109 --> 01:30:41,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Dumbledore.</font>

939
01:30:43,279 --> 01:30:45,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dumbledore?</font>

940
01:30:46,750 --> 01:30:50,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is not wise to be wandering around
this late hour, Tom.</font>

941
01:30:50,420 --> 01:30:53,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, professor. I suppose l . . . .</font>

942
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:56,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had to see for myself
if the rumors were true.</font>

943
01:30:56,670 --> 01:30:59,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm afraid they are, Tom.
They are true.</font>

944
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:02,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">About the school as well?
I don't have a home to go to.</font>

945
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:05,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">They wouldn't really close Hogwarts,
would they, professor?</font>

946
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:08,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">I understand, Tom, but I'm afraid . . .</font>

947
01:31:09,100 --> 01:31:12,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . Headmaster Dippet
may have no choice.</font>

948
01:31:12,189 --> 01:31:16,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir, if it all stopped,
if the person responsible was caught . . . .</font>

949
01:31:18,939 --> 01:31:21,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">ls there something . . .</font>

950
01:31:21,989 --> 01:31:23,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . you wish to tell me?</font>

01:31:25,199 --> 01:31:27,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, sir. Nothing.</font>

952
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:37,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very well, then. Off you go.</font>

953
01:31:37,710 --> 01:31:39,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good night, sir.</font>

954
01:32:15,710 --> 01:32:18,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let's get you out of there.
- Evening, Hagrid.</font>

955
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:23,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to have to turn you in. I don't
think you meant it to kill anyone . . . .</font>

956
01:32:23,470 --> 01:32:25,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't. You don't understand.</font>

957
01:32:25,970 --> 01:32:29,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">The dead girl's parents will be here
tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do . . .</font>

958
01:32:29,270 --> 01:32:32,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . is make sure the thing that killed
their daughter is slaughtered.</font>

959
01:32:32,430 --> 01:32:35,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">It wasn't him.
Aragog never killed no one. Never.</font>

960
01:32:35,899 --> 01:32:38,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Monsters don't make good pets, Hagrid.</font>

961
01:32:38,229 --> 01:32:39,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Now, stand aside.
- No!</font>

962
01:32:40,029 --> 01:32:41,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Stand aside, Hagrid.
- No!</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Aragog!</font>

967
01:32:57,380 --> 01:32:58,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't let you go.</font>

968
01:32:59,300 --> 01:33:02,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'll have your wand for this, Hagrid.
You'll be expelled.</font>

969
01:33:05,130 --> 01:33:07,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hagrid!</font>

970
01:33:37,039 --> 01:33:41,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was Hagrid. Hagrid opened
the Chamber of Secrets 50 years ago.</font>

971
01:33:41,340 --> 01:33:44,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">It can't be Hagrid.
It just can't be.</font>

972
01:33:44,470 --> 01:33:48,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't even know this Tom Riddle.
He sounds like a dirty, rotten snitch.</font>

973
01:33:48,720 --> 01:33:52,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">The monster had killed somebody, Ron.
What would any of us have done?</font>

974
01:33:52,510 --> 01:33:56,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, Hagrid's our friend. Why don't
we just go and ask him about it?</font>

975
01:33:56,689 --> 01:33:59,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">That would be a cheerful visit.
"Hello, Hagrid.</font>

976
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:03,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell us, have you been setting anything
mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?"</font>

977
01:34:03,529 --> 01:34:06,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mad and hairy? You wouldn't be talking
about me, now, would you?</font>

978
01:34:07,029 --> 01:34:08,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

979
01:34:12,579 --> 01:34:14,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's that you've got, Hagrid?</font>

980
01:34:14,659 --> 01:34:19,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.
For the Mandrakes, you know.</font>

981
01:34:19,380 --> 01:34:23,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, according to Professor Sprout,
they've still got a bit of growing to do.</font>

982
01:34:23,210 --> 01:34:26,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">But once their acne's cleared up,
we'll chop them up and stew them . . .</font>

983
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:30,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . and then we'll get those people
down at the hospital un-Petrified.</font>

984
01:34:31,640 --> 01:34:34,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the meantime, though, you three . . .</font>

985
01:34:34,680 --> 01:34:37,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . had best be looking after yourselves.
All right?</font>

986
01:34:45,729 --> 01:34:47,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Neville.</font>

987
01:34:48,739 --> 01:34:51,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry, I don't know who did it,
but you'd better come.</font>

988
01:34:51,619 --> 01:34:53,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on!</font>

989
01:35:15,890 --> 01:35:19,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">It had to be a Gryffindor.
Nobody else knows our password.</font>

990
01:35:20,060 --> 01:35:22,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unless it wasn't a student.</font>

991
01:35:22,479 --> 01:35:25,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoever it was, they must have
been looking for something.</font>

992
01:35:26,069 --> 01:35:27,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">And they found it.</font>

993
01:35:28,239 --> 01:35:30,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tom Riddle's diary is gone.</font>

994
01:35:32,319 --> 01:35:33,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, listen up.</font>

995
01:35:33,779 --> 01:35:36,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">We play our game,
Hufflepuff doesn't stand a chance.</font>

997
01:35:38,909 --> 01:35:41,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not to mention they're dead scared
that Harry will Petrify them . . .</font>

998
01:35:42,079 --> 01:35:45,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">- . . . if they fly anywhere near him.
- Well, that too.</font>

will go to Gryffindor Tower. Now.</font>

the both of you have to see.</font>

1004
01:36:04,520 --> 01:36:08,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">I warn you.
This could be a wee bit of a shock.</font>

1005
01:36:16,489 --> 01:36:17,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hermione!</font>

1006
01:36:17,869 --> 01:36:19,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was found near the library . . .</font>

1008

<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

1010

1011
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:51,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because of recent events, these new
rules will be put into effect immediately:</font>

1012
01:36:51,569 --> 01:36:56,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">"All students will return to their house
common rooms by 6:00 every evening.</font>

1013
01:36:56,869 --> 01:37:00,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">All students will be escorted
to each lesson by a teacher.</font>

1014
01:37:01,119 --> 01:37:04,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">No exceptions. "</font>

1015
01:37:04,789 --> 01:37:06,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should tell you this:</font>

1016
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:11,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unless the culprit
behind these attacks is caught . . .</font>

1017
01:37:11,670 --> 01:37:14,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . it is likely the school will be closed.</font>

1018
01:37:26,350 --> 01:37:29,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron.
I can't believe it's him . . .</font>

1019
01:37:29,479 --> 01:37:31,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . but if he did set the monster loose
last time . . .</font>

1020
01:37:31,939 --> 01:37:35,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . he'll know how to get inside
the Chamber of Secrets. That's a start.</font>

1021
01:37:35,279 --> 01:37:36,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you heard McGonagall.</font>

1022
01:37:36,699 --> 01:37:39,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not allowed to leave
the tower except for class.</font>

1023
01:37:40,449 --> 01:37:42,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think it's time to get
my dad's old cloak out again.</font>

1024
01:37:56,550 --> 01:37:58,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's there?</font>

1025
01:38:02,060 --> 01:38:03,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello?</font>

1026
01:38:04,270 --> 01:38:05,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello?</font>

1027
01:38:06,979 --> 01:38:11,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's that for?
- Nothing. I was expecting . . . .</font>

1028
01:38:11,439 --> 01:38:15,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">It doesn't matter. Come on in.
I just made a pot of tea.</font>

1029
01:38:18,069 --> 01:38:20,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hagrid, are you okay?</font>

1030
01:38:20,529 --> 01:38:23,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm fine. I'm all right.</font>

1031
01:38:24,369 --> 01:38:26,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you hear about Hermione?</font>

1032
01:38:26,579 --> 01:38:30,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. I heard about that, all right.</font>

1033
01:38:30,579 --> 01:38:34,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, we have to ask you something.</font>

1034
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:39,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know who's opened
the Chamber of Secrets?</font>

1035
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:44,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">What you had to understand
about that is—</font>

1036
01:38:45,720 --> 01:38:47,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quick, under the cloak.</font>

1037
01:38:47,979 --> 01:38:51,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't say a word.
Be quiet, both of you.</font>

1038
01:38:57,489 --> 01:39:00,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Professor Dumbledore, sir.
- Good evening, Hagrid.</font>

1039
01:39:00,739 --> 01:39:03,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wonder, could we . . .?</font>

1040
01:39:03,329 --> 01:39:05,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course. Come in. Come in.</font>

1041
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's Dad's boss.</font>

1042
01:39:07,539 --> 01:39:11,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic.</font>

1043
01:39:11,289 --> 01:39:15,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bad business, Hagrid, very bad business.
Had to come.</font>

1044
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:19,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three attacks on Muggle-borns.
Things have gone far enough.</font>

1045
01:39:19,260 --> 01:39:22,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The Ministry's got to act.
- But I never—</font>

1046
01:39:22,680 --> 01:39:24,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know I never, professor.</font>

1047
01:39:24,640 --> 01:39:27,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want it understood, Cornelius . . .</font>

1048
01:39:27,890 --> 01:39:29,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . that Hagrid . . .</font>

1049
01:39:29,890 --> 01:39:32,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . has my full confidence.</font>

1050
01:39:32,350 --> 01:39:36,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">Albus, look,
Hagrid's record is against him.</font>

1051
01:39:36,319 --> 01:39:38,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I've got to take him.
- Take me?</font>

1052
01:39:39,029 --> 01:39:41,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take me where?
Not Azkaban prison.</font>

1053
01:39:41,609 --> 01:39:45,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm afraid we have no choice, Hagrid.</font>

1054
01:39:45,989 --> 01:39:47,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Already here, Fudge?</font>

1055
01:39:48,079 --> 01:39:49,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good.</font>

1056
01:39:50,329 --> 01:39:53,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing here?
Get out of my house!</font>

1057
01:39:53,750 --> 01:39:55,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Believe me . . .</font>

1058
01:39:55,590 --> 01:39:59,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . .l take absolutely no pleasure
being inside your . . . .</font>

1059
01:40:01,680 --> 01:40:03,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">You call this a house?</font>

1060
01:40:04,970 --> 01:40:06,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

1061
01:40:06,180 --> 01:40:10,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">I simply called up the school
and was told the headmaster was here.</font>

1062
01:40:10,229 --> 01:40:14,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, what exactly is it
that you want with me?</font>

1063
01:40:14,859 --> 01:40:19,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">The other governors and I have decided
it's time for you to step aside.</font>

1064
01:40:21,239 --> 01:40:24,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is an order of suspension.</font>

1065
01:40:29,699 --> 01:40:33,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll find all 12 signatures on it.</font>

1066
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:41,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm afraid we feel
you've rather lost your touch.</font>

1067
01:40:41,880 --> 01:40:44,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, what, with all these attacks . . .</font>

1068
01:40:44,390 --> 01:40:47,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . there'll be no
Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts.</font>

1069
01:40:47,350 --> 01:40:51,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can only imagine what an awful loss
that would be to the school.</font>

1070
01:40:52,060 --> 01:40:54,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't take
Professor Dumbledore away.</font>

1071
01:40:54,560 --> 01:40:57,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take him away and the Muggle-borns
won't stand a chance.</font>

1072
01:40:57,270 --> 01:40:59,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">You mark my words,
there'll be killings next!</font>

1073
01:40:59,899 --> 01:41:01,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think so?</font>

1074
01:41:01,739 --> 01:41:04,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Calm yourself, Hagrid.</font>

1075
01:41:05,569 --> 01:41:08,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">if the governors desire my removal . . .</font>

1076
01:41:08,489 --> 01:41:12,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . .l will, of course, step aside.</font>

1077
01:41:13,789 --> 01:41:16,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">However . . .</font>

1078
01:41:16,710 --> 01:41:21,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . you will find that help
will always be given at Hogwarts . . .</font>

1079
01:41:21,420 --> 01:41:23,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . to those who . . .</font>

1080
01:41:23,470 --> 01:41:25,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . ask for it.</font>

1081
01:41:32,600 --> 01:41:34,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">Admirable sentiments.</font>

1082
01:41:35,100 --> 01:41:36,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shall we?</font>

1083
01:41:49,029 --> 01:41:50,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fudge.</font>

1084
01:41:52,289 --> 01:41:54,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come, Hagrid.</font>

1085
01:41:55,250 --> 01:41:56,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well?</font>

1086
01:41:57,460 --> 01:41:58,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">if . . . .</font>

1087
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:01,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">if anybody was looking for some stuff . . .</font>

1088
01:42:01,670 --> 01:42:06,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . then all they'd have to do
would be to follow the spiders.</font>

1089
01:42:06,720 --> 01:42:09,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yep. That would lead them right.</font>

1090
01:42:09,470 --> 01:42:11,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's all I have to say.</font>

1091
01:42:13,140 --> 01:42:16,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">And someone will need
to feed Fang while I'm away.</font>

1092
01:42:20,270 --> 01:42:22,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good boy.</font>

1093
01:42:28,409 --> 01:42:30,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hagrid's right.</font>

1094
01:42:30,699 --> 01:42:33,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">With Dumbledore gone,
there'll be an attack a day.</font>

1095
01:42:33,829 --> 01:42:35,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look.</font>

1096
01:42:41,539 --> 01:42:43,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

1097
01:42:47,050 --> 01:42:49,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, Fang.</font>

1098
01:43:07,359 --> 01:43:08,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

1099
01:43:08,899 --> 01:43:10,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

1100
01:43:10,359 --> 01:43:13,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">You heard what Hagrid said.
"Follow the spiders. "</font>

1101
01:43:13,829 --> 01:43:16,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're heading to the Dark Forest.</font>

1102
01:43:18,500 --> 01:43:22,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why spiders? Why couldn't it be
"follow the butterflies"?</font>

1103
01:43:58,699 --> 01:44:01,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry, I don't like this.</font>

1104
01:44:06,590 --> 01:44:09,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Harry, I don't like this at all.
- Shush!</font>

1105
01:44:21,310 --> 01:44:23,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can we go back now?</font>

1106
01:44:24,020 --> 01:44:25,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

1107
01:45:15,489 --> 01:45:18,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who is it?</font>

1108
01:45:18,909 --> 01:45:20,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't panic.</font>

1109
01:45:20,369 --> 01:45:21,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hagrid?</font>

1110
01:45:22,289 --> 01:45:23,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that you?</font>

1111
01:45:24,460 --> 01:45:26,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're friends of Hagrid's.</font>

1112
01:45:44,479 --> 01:45:47,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you?
You're Aragog, aren't you?</font>

1113
01:45:48,310 --> 01:45:49,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

1114
01:45:49,770 --> 01:45:53,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hagrid has never sent
men into our hollow before.</font>

1115
01:45:53,739 --> 01:45:56,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's in trouble. Up at the school,
there have been attacks.</font>

1116
01:45:57,489 --> 01:45:59,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">They think it's Hagrid.</font>

1117
01:45:59,489 --> 01:46:03,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">They think he opened
the Chamber of Secrets. Like before.</font>

1118
01:46:03,329 --> 01:46:05,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a lie.</font>

1119
01:46:06,119 --> 01:46:09,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hagrid never opened
the Chamber of Secrets.</font>

1120
01:46:09,670 --> 01:46:12,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Then you're not the monster?
- No.</font>

1121
01:46:12,710 --> 01:46:15,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">The monster was born in the castle.</font>

1122
01:46:15,970 --> 01:46:21,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">I came to Hagrid from a distant land
in the pocket of a traveler.</font>

1123
01:46:21,890 --> 01:46:23,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry.</font>

1124
01:46:25,430 --> 01:46:30,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if you're not the monster, then
what did kill that girl 50 years ago?</font>

1125
01:46:30,189 --> 01:46:33,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">We do not speak of it.</font>

1126
01:46:33,529 --> 01:46:39,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is an ancient creature we
spiders fear above all others.</font>

1127
01:46:39,239 --> 01:46:41,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">But have you seen it?</font>

1128
01:46:41,699 --> 01:46:47,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never saw any part of the castle
but the box in which Hagrid kept me.</font>

1129
01:46:47,710 --> 01:46:50,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">The girl was discovered
in a bathroom.</font>

1130
01:46:51,039 --> 01:46:55,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I was accused,
Hagrid brought me here.</font>

1131
01:46:55,710 --> 01:46:57,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Harry!
- What?</font>

1132
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:13,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, thank you.</font>

1133
01:47:14,529 --> 01:47:16,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll just go.</font>

1134
01:47:17,149 --> 01:47:18,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go?</font>

1135
01:47:19,109 --> 01:47:20,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think not.</font>

1136
01:47:21,069 --> 01:47:26,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">My sons and daughters
do not harm Hagrid on my command.</font>

1137
01:47:26,699 --> 01:47:29,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I cannot deny them
fresh meat . . .</font>

1138
01:47:29,289 --> 01:47:33,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . when it wanders
so willingly into our midst.</font>

1139
01:47:33,789 --> 01:47:37,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goodbye, friend of Hagrid.</font>

1140
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:39,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can we panic now?</font>

1141
01:47:50,310 --> 01:47:52,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">Know any spells?</font>

1142
01:47:52,399 --> 01:47:55,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">One, but it's not powerful
enough for all of them.</font>

1143
01:47:55,729 --> 01:47:58,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's Hermione when you need her?</font>

1144
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:13,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go!</font>

1145
01:48:18,420 --> 01:48:20,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Arania Exumai!</font>

1146
01:48:25,800 --> 01:48:27,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go!</font>

1147
01:48:45,119 --> 01:48:47,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Glad we're out of there.</font>

1148
01:48:54,170 --> 01:48:56,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Arania Exumai!</font>

1149
01:49:02,220 --> 01:49:05,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thanks for that.
- Don't mention it.</font>

1150
01:49:16,899 --> 01:49:19,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get us out of here.</font>

1151
01:49:19,569 --> 01:49:21,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now!</font>

1152
01:49:23,319 --> 01:49:27,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on!
Come on, move faster!</font>

1153
01:49:30,239 --> 01:49:31,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on! Go!</font>

1154
01:49:49,100 --> 01:49:51,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get us in the air.</font>

1155
01:49:52,220 --> 01:49:53,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">The flying gear's jammed!</font>

1156
01:49:57,770 --> 01:50:01,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Come on! Pull!
- I'm trying!</font>

1157
01:50:30,890 --> 01:50:33,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">Follow the spiders.
Follow the spiders.</font>

1158
01:50:33,970 --> 01:50:38,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">if Hagrid ever gets out of Azkaban,
I'll kill him.</font>

1159
01:50:52,329 --> 01:50:55,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, what was the point
of sending us in there?</font>

1160
01:50:55,699 --> 01:51:00,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What have we found out?
- We know one thing.</font>

1161
01:51:00,500 --> 01:51:03,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hagrid never opened
the Chamber of Secrets.</font>

1162
01:51:04,090 --> 01:51:06,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was innocent.</font>

1163
01:51:21,560 --> 01:51:24,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wish you were here, Hermione.</font>

1164
01:51:24,569 --> 01:51:26,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need you.</font>

1165
01:51:27,779 --> 01:51:29,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now more than ever.</font>

1166
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:50,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's that?
- Ron . . . .</font>

1167
01:51:51,050 --> 01:51:55,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is why Hermione was in
the library the day she was attacked.</font>

1168
01:51:56,060 --> 01:51:57,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

1169
01:51:57,979 --> 01:52:00,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Of the many fearsome beasts
that roam our land . . .</font>

1170
01:52:01,100 --> 01:52:05,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . none is more deadly than the basilisk.
Capable of living for hundreds of years . . .</font>

1171
01:52:05,899 --> 01:52:09,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . instant death awaits any who meet
this giant serpent's eye.</font>

1172
01:52:09,859 --> 01:52:12,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Spiders flee before it. "
Ron, this is it.</font>

1173
01:52:13,029 --> 01:52:15,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">The monster in the Chamber
of Secrets is a basilisk.</font>

1174
01:52:15,989 --> 01:52:19,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why I can hear it speak.
It's a snake.</font>

1175
01:52:20,250 --> 01:52:25,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if it kills by looking people
in the eye, why is it no one's dead?</font>

1176
01:52:36,180 --> 01:52:39,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because no one did look it
in the eye.</font>

1177
01:52:41,060 --> 01:52:43,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not directly, at least.</font>

1178
01:52:44,899 --> 01:52:47,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Colin saw it through his camera.</font>

1179
01:52:47,270 --> 01:52:51,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">Justin— Justin must have seen the
basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick.</font>

1180
01:52:51,489 --> 01:52:55,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nick got the full blast of it.
But he's a ghost, he couldn't die again.</font>

1181
01:52:55,659 --> 01:52:58,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Hermione had the mirror.</font>

1182
01:52:58,949 --> 01:53:02,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">I bet you she was using it to look
around corners in case it came along.</font>

1183
01:53:02,500 --> 01:53:03,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Mrs. Norris?</font>

1184
01:53:03,960 --> 01:53:07,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm pretty sure she didn't have
a camera or a mirror, Harry.</font>

1185
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:10,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">The water.</font>

1186
01:53:11,340 --> 01:53:16,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">There was water on the floor that night.
She only saw the basilisk's reflection.</font>

1187
01:53:23,060 --> 01:53:24,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Spiders flee before it. "</font>

1188
01:53:25,149 --> 01:53:28,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It all fits.
- How's a basilisk been getting around?</font>

1189
01:53:29,069 --> 01:53:31,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">A dirty, great snake.
Someone would have seen it.</font>

1190
01:53:32,069 --> 01:53:37,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hermione's answered that too.
- Pipes? It's using the plumbing.</font>

1191
01:53:37,909 --> 01:53:42,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember what Aragog said
about that girl 50 years ago?</font>

1192
01:53:42,329 --> 01:53:46,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">She died in a bathroom?
What if she never left?</font>

1193
01:53:47,250 --> 01:53:48,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Moaning Myrtle.</font>

1194
01:53:49,550 --> 01:53:53,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">All students are to return
to their house dormitories at once.</font>

1195
01:53:53,760 --> 01:53:57,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">All teachers to the second-floor
corridor immediately.</font>

1196
01:54:02,180 --> 01:54:08,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">As you can see, the Heir of Slytherin
has left another message.</font>

1197
01:54:08,189 --> 01:54:10,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our worst fear has been realized.</font>

1198
01:54:10,569 --> 01:54:15,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">A student has been taken by the monster
into the Chamber itself.</font>

1199
01:54:16,199 --> 01:54:21,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">The students must be sent home.
I'm afraid this is the end of Hogwarts.</font>

1200
01:54:24,250 --> 01:54:26,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">So sorry. Dozed off.
What have I missed?</font>

1201
01:54:26,869 --> 01:54:31,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">A girl has been snatched by the monster,
Lockhart. Your moment has come at last.</font>

1202
01:54:31,380 --> 01:54:34,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">- My moment?
- Weren't you saying just last night . . .</font>

1203
01:54:34,510 --> 01:54:39,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . that you've known all along where the
entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?</font>

1204
01:54:40,390 --> 01:54:45,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's settled. We'll leave you
to deal with the monster, Gilderoy.</font>

1205
01:54:46,060 --> 01:54:51,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Your skills, after all, are legend.
- Very well.</font>

1206
01:54:51,399 --> 01:54:54,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll just be in my office getting . . . .</font>

1207
01:54:55,439 --> 01:54:57,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Getting ready.</font>

1208
01:55:00,319 --> 01:55:03,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who is it that the monster's taken,
Minerva?</font>

1209
01:55:03,699 --> 01:55:05,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ginny Weasley.</font>

1210
01:55:16,920 --> 01:55:20,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Her skeleton will lie
in the Chamber forever. "</font>

1211
01:55:24,060 --> 01:55:25,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ginny.</font>

1212
01:55:27,939 --> 01:55:31,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lockhart may be useless, but he's
going to try and get into the Chamber.</font>

1213
01:55:31,609 --> 01:55:34,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">At least we can tell him
what we know.</font>

1214
01:55:35,649 --> 01:55:38,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor, we have some information
for you.</font>

1215
01:55:39,989 --> 01:55:41,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you going somewhere?</font>

1216
01:55:42,119 --> 01:55:45,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, yes. Urgent call. Unavoidable.
Got to go.</font>

1217
01:55:45,409 --> 01:55:48,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What about my sister?
- Well . . . .</font>

1218
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:52,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">As to that, most unfortunate.
No one regrets more than l.</font>

1219
01:55:52,630 --> 01:55:56,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the Defense Against the Dark
Arts teacher. You can't go now.</font>

1220
01:55:56,800 --> 01:55:59,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">I must say, when I took the job,
there was nothing in the description—</font>

1221
01:55:59,970 --> 01:56:01,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're running away?</font>

1222
01:56:01,300 --> 01:56:04,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">- After all you did in your books?
- Books can be misleading.</font>

1223
01:56:04,260 --> 01:56:06,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You wrote them.
- My dear boy, use your common sense.</font>

1224
01:56:06,970 --> 01:56:11,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">My books wouldn't have sold as well if
people didn't think I'd done those things.</font>

1225
01:56:11,979 --> 01:56:13,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a fraud.</font>

1226
01:56:13,729 --> 01:56:16,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've been taking credit
for what other wizards have done.</font>

1227
01:56:16,689 --> 01:56:18,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">ls there anything you can do?</font>

1228
01:56:18,819 --> 01:56:23,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, now you mention it.
I'm rather gifted with Memory Charms.</font>

1229
01:56:23,699 --> 01:56:26,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Otherwise, all those wizards
would have gone blabbing.</font>

1230
01:56:26,369 --> 01:56:29,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd never have sold another book.</font>

1231
01:56:29,659 --> 01:56:35,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">In fact, I'm going to have to do
the same to you.</font>

1232
01:56:35,880 --> 01:56:38,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't even think about it.</font>

1233
01:56:49,520 --> 01:56:50,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's there?</font>

1234
01:56:53,399 --> 01:56:55,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Harry.</font>

1235
01:56:56,359 --> 01:57:01,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What do you want?
- To ask you how you died.</font>

1236
01:57:03,909 --> 01:57:06,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was dreadful.</font>

1237
01:57:06,529 --> 01:57:10,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">It happened right here
in this very cubicle.</font>

1238
01:57:10,369 --> 01:57:14,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd hidden because Olive Hornby
was teasing me about my glasses.</font>

1239
01:57:14,579 --> 01:57:19,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was crying, and then
I heard somebody come in.</font>

1240
01:57:19,670 --> 01:57:26,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who was it, Myrtle?
- I don't know. I was distraught!</font>

1241
01:57:27,300 --> 01:57:30,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">But they said something funny,
a kind of made-up language.</font>

1242
01:57:30,890 --> 01:57:37,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I realized it was a boy, so I unlocked
the door to tell him to go away and . . .</font>

1243
01:57:38,399 --> 01:57:43,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">- . . .l died.
- Just like that? How?</font>

1244
01:57:43,399 --> 01:57:47,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just remember seeing a pair
of great, big, yellow eyes . . .</font>

1245
01:57:48,079 --> 01:57:51,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . over there by that sink.</font>

1246
01:58:17,020 --> 01:58:19,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is it.</font>

1247
01:58:19,939 --> 01:58:24,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is it, Ron. I think this is
the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets.</font>

1248
01:58:26,779 --> 01:58:31,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say something. Harry,
say something in Parseltongue.</font>

1249
01:59:23,170 --> 01:59:27,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excellent, Harry. Good work.
Well, then, I'll just be . . . .</font>

1250
01:59:27,420 --> 01:59:29,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no need for me to stay.</font>

1251
01:59:30,300 --> 01:59:32,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, there is.</font>

1252
01:59:34,010 --> 01:59:37,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You first.
- Now, boys, what good will it do?</font>

1253
01:59:37,270 --> 01:59:38,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Better you than us.</font>

1254
01:59:39,810 --> 01:59:42,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">But— Obviously, yes.</font>

1255
01:59:47,029 --> 01:59:49,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure you don't want to test it first?</font>

1256
01:59:56,539 --> 01:59:59,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's really quite filthy down here.</font>

1257
02:00:00,250 --> 02:00:04,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">- All right. Let's go.
- Oh, Harry?</font>

1258
02:00:05,210 --> 02:00:10,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you die down there,
you're welcome to share my toilet.</font>

1259
02:00:12,680 --> 02:00:14,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks, Myrtle.</font>

1260
02:00:43,750 --> 02:00:48,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, remember: Any sign of movement,
close your eyes straightaway.</font>

1261
02:00:49,880 --> 02:00:51,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on.</font>

1262
02:00:55,260 --> 02:00:56,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">This way.</font>

1263
02:01:03,600 --> 02:01:08,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's this?
- It looks like a snake.</font>

1264
02:01:09,029 --> 02:01:12,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's a snakeskin.
- Bloody hell.</font>

1265
02:01:12,859 --> 02:01:18,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever shed this must be
60 feet long. Or more.</font>

1266
02:01:20,579 --> 02:01:23,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heart of a lion, this one.</font>

1267
02:01:27,250 --> 02:01:31,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">The adventure ends here, boys.
But don't fret.</font>

1268
02:01:33,840 --> 02:01:39,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">The world will know our story.
How I was too late to save the girl.</font>

1269
02:01:39,640 --> 02:01:43,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">How you two
tragically lost your minds . . .</font>

1270
02:01:43,310 --> 02:01:46,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . at the sight of her mangled body.</font>

1271
02:01:47,149 --> 02:01:48,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">So . . . .</font>

1272
02:01:49,729 --> 02:01:52,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">You first, Mr. Potter.</font>

1273
02:01:52,319 --> 02:01:55,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say goodbye to your memories.</font>

1274
02:01:57,529 --> 02:01:59,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Obliviate!</font>

1275
02:02:33,399 --> 02:02:36,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ron! Ron, are you okay?
- I'm fine.</font>

1276
02:02:40,279 --> 02:02:42,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello.</font>

1277
02:02:42,699 --> 02:02:44,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are you?</font>

1278
02:02:45,909 --> 02:02:48,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ron Weasley.
- Really?</font>

1279
02:02:48,750 --> 02:02:51,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">And who am l?</font>

1280
02:02:53,380 --> 02:02:57,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lockhart's Memory Charm backfired.
He hasn't got a clue who he is.</font>

1281
02:02:58,050 --> 02:03:02,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's an odd sort of place, isn't it?</font>

1282
02:03:02,720 --> 02:03:04,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you live here?</font>

1283
02:03:05,560 --> 02:03:08,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- Really?</font>

1284
02:03:12,649 --> 02:03:14,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What do I do now?
- You wait here . . .</font>

1285
02:03:14,609 --> 02:03:17,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . and try and shift some of this rock
so we can get back through.</font>

1286
02:03:17,739 --> 02:03:21,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'll go on and find Ginny.
- Okay.</font>

1287
02:04:54,630 --> 02:04:58,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ginny! Ginny, please don't be dead.
Wake up, wake up.</font>

1288
02:04:59,010 --> 02:05:01,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please wake up.</font>

1289
02:05:01,340 --> 02:05:03,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">She won't wake.</font>

1290
02:05:08,970 --> 02:05:13,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tom. Tom Riddle.
What do you mean, she won't wake?</font>

1291
02:05:13,479 --> 02:05:16,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">- She's not . . .?
- She's still alive, but only just.</font>

1292
02:05:17,859 --> 02:05:20,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are you a ghost?
- A memory . . .</font>

1293
02:05:20,319 --> 02:05:22,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . preserved in a diary for 50 years.</font>

1294
02:05:25,369 --> 02:05:30,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's cold as ice.
Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up.</font>

1295
02:05:30,750 --> 02:05:33,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've got to help me, Tom.
There's a basilisk.</font>

1296
02:05:33,329 --> 02:05:35,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">It won't come until it's called.</font>

1297
02:05:38,710 --> 02:05:41,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Give me my wand, Tom.
- You won't be needing it.</font>

1298
02:05:42,590 --> 02:05:46,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We've got to go. We've got to save her.
- I'm afraid I can't do that.</font>

1299
02:05:46,180 --> 02:05:50,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker,
I grow stronger.</font>

1300
02:05:51,560 --> 02:05:56,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, Harry, it was Ginny Weasley
who opened the Chamber of Secrets.</font>

1301
02:05:56,229 --> 02:05:58,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. She couldn't. She wouldn't.</font>

1302
02:05:58,729 --> 02:06:01,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was Ginny who set the basilisk
on the Mudbloods and Filch's cat . . .</font>

1303
02:06:02,109 --> 02:06:04,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . Ginny who wrote the threatening
messages on the walls.</font>

1304
02:06:04,739 --> 02:06:08,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But why?
- Because I told her to.</font>

1305
02:06:08,199 --> 02:06:13,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll find I can be very persuasive.
Not that she knew what she was doing.</font>

1306
02:06:13,329 --> 02:06:16,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was, shall we say,
in a kind of trance.</font>

1307
02:06:17,210 --> 02:06:19,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Still, the power of the diary
began to scare her.</font>

1308
02:06:19,880 --> 02:06:22,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">She tried to dispose of it
in the girls' bathroom.</font>

1309
02:06:22,420 --> 02:06:26,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then who should find it but you?</font>

1310
02:06:26,930 --> 02:06:30,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">The very person
I was most anxious to meet.</font>

1311
02:06:30,640 --> 02:06:32,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">And why did you want to meet me?</font>

1312
02:06:33,100 --> 02:06:36,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew I had to talk to you,
meet you if I could.</font>

1313
02:06:36,649 --> 02:06:39,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I decided to show you my capture
of that brainless oaf Hagrid . . .</font>

1314
02:06:40,109 --> 02:06:43,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">- . . . to gain your trust.
- Hagrid's my friend.</font>

1315
02:06:44,189 --> 02:06:48,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And you framed him, didn't you?
- It was my word against Hagrid's.</font>

1316
02:06:48,949 --> 02:06:52,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only Dumbledore seemed to think
he was innocent.</font>

1317
02:06:52,409 --> 02:06:54,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll bet Dumbledore saw
right through you.</font>

1318
02:06:54,750 --> 02:06:58,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">He certainly kept an annoyingly close
watch on me after that.</font>

1319
02:06:58,380 --> 02:07:01,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew it wouldn't be safe to open the
Chamber again while I was at school . . .</font>

1320
02:07:01,840 --> 02:07:03,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . so I decided to leave behind
a diary . . .</font>

1321
02:07:03,840 --> 02:07:05,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . preserving my 16-year-old self
in its pages . . .</font>

1322
02:07:06,130 --> 02:07:08,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . so that one day
I would be able to lead another . . .</font>

1323
02:07:08,970 --> 02:07:11,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . to finish Salazar Slytherin's
noble work.</font>

1324
02:07:11,970 --> 02:07:14,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you haven't finished it
this time.</font>

1325
02:07:14,390 --> 02:07:17,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">In a few hours, the Mandrake Draught
will be ready.</font>

1326
02:07:17,520 --> 02:07:20,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">And everyone who was Petrified
will be all right again.</font>

1327
02:07:20,649 --> 02:07:25,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Haven't I told you? Killing Mudbloods
doesn't matter to me anymore.</font>

1328
02:07:26,149 --> 02:07:30,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">For many months now,
my new target has been you.</font>

1329
02:07:32,409 --> 02:07:36,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">How is it that a baby
with no extraordinary magical talent . . .</font>

1330
02:07:36,159 --> 02:07:38,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . was able to defeat the greatest wizard
of all time?</font>

1331
02:07:39,170 --> 02:07:42,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did you escape with nothing
but a scar . . .</font>

1332
02:07:42,289 --> 02:07:44,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . while Lord Voldemort's powers
were destroyed?</font>

1333
02:07:44,840 --> 02:07:49,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you care how I escaped?
Voldemort was after your time.</font>

1334
02:07:49,180 --> 02:07:55,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Voldemort is my past,
present and future.</font>

1335
02:08:16,079 --> 02:08:19,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">You. You're the Heir of Slytherin.</font>

1336
02:08:22,710 --> 02:08:26,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're Voldemort.
- Surely you didn't think . . .</font>

1337
02:08:26,460 --> 02:08:30,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . .l was going to keep
my filthy Muggle father's name?</font>

1338
02:08:31,140 --> 02:08:35,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. I fashioned myself a new name,
a name I knew wizards everywhere . . .</font>

1339
02:08:35,470 --> 02:08:39,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . would fear to speak when I became
the greatest sorcerer in the world.</font>

1340
02:08:39,850 --> 02:08:43,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">Albus Dumbledore
is the greatest sorcerer in the world.</font>

1341
02:08:43,189 --> 02:08:46,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dumbledore's been driven out of
this castle by the mere memory of me.</font>

1342
02:08:46,779 --> 02:08:51,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll never be gone. Not as long as
those who remain are loyal to him.</font>

1343
02:08:58,199 --> 02:08:59,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fawkes?</font>

1344
02:09:15,510 --> 02:09:19,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">So this is what Dumbledore
sends his great defender.</font>

1345
02:09:19,270 --> 02:09:22,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">A songbird and an old hat.</font>

1346
02:09:36,239 --> 02:09:40,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's match the power of Lord
Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin . . .</font>

1347
02:09:40,960 --> 02:09:44,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . against the famous Harry Potter.</font>

1348
02:09:58,310 --> 02:10:02,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Parseltongue won't save you now,
Potter. It only obeys me.</font>

1349
02:10:32,840 --> 02:10:34,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

1350
02:10:34,840 --> 02:10:39,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your bird may have blinded the basilisk,
but it can still hear you.</font>

1351
02:12:21,319 --> 02:12:24,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, Potter.
The process is nearly complete.</font>

1352
02:12:24,789 --> 02:12:29,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">In a few minutes, Ginny Weasley will be
dead, and I will cease to be a memory.</font>

1353
02:12:29,869 --> 02:12:32,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Voldemort will return . . .</font>

1354
02:12:32,920 --> 02:12:37,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . very much alive.</font>

1355
02:12:37,840 --> 02:12:39,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ginny?</font>

1356
02:14:55,600 --> 02:14:57,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remarkable, isn't it . . .</font>

1357
02:14:57,350 --> 02:15:01,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . how quickly the venom
of the basilisk penetrates the body?</font>

1358
02:15:01,529 --> 02:15:04,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd guess you have little more
than a minute to live.</font>

1359
02:15:04,529 --> 02:15:08,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll be with your dear
Mudblood mother soon, Harry.</font>

1360
02:15:13,579 --> 02:15:17,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Funny, the damage a silly
little book can do . . .</font>

1361
02:15:17,420 --> 02:15:22,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . especially in the hands
of a silly little girl.</font>

1362
02:15:25,300 --> 02:15:27,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

1363
02:15:29,970 --> 02:15:32,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop. No!</font>

1364
02:16:30,359 --> 02:16:34,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was me.
But I swear, I didn't mean to.</font>

1365
02:16:34,540 --> 02:16:38,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">Riddle made me, and . . . .</font>

1366
02:16:38,540 --> 02:16:41,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry, you're hurt.</font>

1367
02:16:41,540 --> 02:16:43,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry.</font>

1368
02:16:43,209 --> 02:16:46,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ginny, you need
to get yourself out.</font>

1369
02:16:47,049 --> 02:16:50,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">Follow the Chamber
and you'll find Ron.</font>

1370
02:17:02,440 --> 02:17:04,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were brilliant, Fawkes.</font>

1371
02:17:05,690 --> 02:17:08,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just wasn't quick enough.</font>

1372
02:17:28,920 --> 02:17:30,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course.</font>

1373
02:17:30,930 --> 02:17:33,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Phoenix tears have healing powers.</font>

1374
02:17:35,389 --> 02:17:37,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks.</font>

1375
02:17:38,930 --> 02:17:41,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all right, Ginny.</font>

1376
02:17:42,190 --> 02:17:44,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's over.</font>

1377
02:17:45,399 --> 02:17:47,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just a memory.</font>

1378
02:17:50,819 --> 02:17:56,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Amazing!
This is just like magic!</font>

1379
02:18:07,459 --> 02:18:10,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">You both realize, of course . . .</font>

1380
02:18:10,299 --> 02:18:15,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . that in the past few hours, you have
broken perhaps a dozen school rules.</font>

1381
02:18:16,430 --> 02:18:17,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, sir.</font>

1382
02:18:17,639 --> 02:18:20,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is sufficient evidence
to have you both expelled.</font>

1383
02:18:21,020 --> 02:18:22,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, sir.</font>

1384
02:18:22,389 --> 02:18:25,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">Therefore, it is only fitting . . .</font>

1385
02:18:26,690 --> 02:18:28,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . that you both receive . . .</font>

1386
02:18:29,479 --> 02:18:33,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . Special Awards for Services
to the School.</font>

1387
02:18:35,659 --> 02:18:37,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks, sir.</font>

1388
02:18:38,079 --> 02:18:40,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, Mr. Weasley, if you would . . .</font>

1389
02:18:40,540 --> 02:18:44,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . have an owl deliver these
release papers to Azkaban.</font>

1390
02:18:45,829 --> 02:18:50,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe we want
our gamekeeper back.</font>

1391
02:18:55,549 --> 02:18:59,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">First, I want to thank you, Harry.</font>

1392
02:19:00,510 --> 02:19:04,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must have shown me
real loyalty down in the Chamber.</font>

1393
02:19:04,889 --> 02:19:09,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing but that
could have called Fawkes to you.</font>

1394
02:19:11,860 --> 02:19:13,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">And . . .</font>

1395
02:19:13,989 --> 02:19:15,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . second . . .</font>

1396
02:19:15,569 --> 02:19:20,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . .l sense that something
is troubling you.</font>

1397
02:19:20,579 --> 02:19:23,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Am I right, Harry?</font>

1398
02:19:24,909 --> 02:19:26,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just . . . .</font>

1399
02:19:27,829 --> 02:19:32,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see, sir, I couldn't help
but notice certain things, certain . . . .</font>

1400
02:19:32,709 --> 02:19:38,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Certain similarities
between Tom Riddle and me.</font>

1401
02:19:38,930 --> 02:19:40,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see.</font>

1402
02:19:40,299 --> 02:19:46,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you can speak
Parseltongue, Harry. Why?</font>

1403
02:19:46,559 --> 02:19:52,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because Lord Voldemort
can speak Parseltongue.</font>

1404
02:19:53,280 --> 02:19:56,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">if I'm not mistaken, Harry . . .</font>

1405
02:19:56,399 --> 02:20:00,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . he transferred
some of his powers to you . . .</font>

1406
02:20:00,409 --> 02:20:03,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . the night he gave you that scar.</font>

1407
02:20:03,540 --> 02:20:07,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Voldemort transferred
some of his powers to me?</font>

1408
02:20:09,329 --> 02:20:12,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not intentionally . . .</font>

1409
02:20:12,920 --> 02:20:14,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . but yes.</font>

1410
02:20:16,760 --> 02:20:20,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">So the Sorting Hat was right.
I should be in Slytherin.</font>

1411
02:20:20,260 --> 02:20:25,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's true. You possess many of the
qualities that Voldemort himself prizes.</font>

1412
02:20:25,270 --> 02:20:28,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Determination, resourcefulness . . .</font>

1413
02:20:28,270 --> 02:20:32,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . and if I may say so,
a certain disregard for the rules.</font>

1414
02:20:32,979 --> 02:20:36,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why, then, did the Sorting Hat
place you in Gryffindor?</font>

1415
02:20:37,819 --> 02:20:41,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Because I asked it to.
- Exactly, Harry. Exactly.</font>

1416
02:20:41,659 --> 02:20:43,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which makes you different
from Voldemort.</font>

1417
02:20:43,909 --> 02:20:47,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is not our abilities
that show what we truly are.</font>

1418
02:20:48,079 --> 02:20:50,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is our choices.</font>

1419
02:20:53,879 --> 02:20:57,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you want proof
why you belong in Gryffindor . . .</font>

1420
02:20:57,459 --> 02:21:02,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . then I suggest
you look more closely at this.</font>

1421
02:21:03,350 --> 02:21:05,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be careful.</font>

1422
02:21:10,690 --> 02:21:13,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Godric Gryffindor.</font>

1423
02:21:13,520 --> 02:21:17,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">It would take a true Gryffindor
to pull that out of the hat.</font>

1424
02:21:26,489 --> 02:21:27,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dobby.</font>

1425
02:21:29,159 --> 02:21:33,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">So this is your master.
The family you serve is the Malfoys.</font>

1426
02:21:35,709 --> 02:21:39,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll deal with you later.</font>

1427
02:21:44,889 --> 02:21:46,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Out of my way, Potter.</font>

1428
02:21:46,680 --> 02:21:50,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">So it's true. You have returned.</font>

1429
02:21:50,940 --> 02:21:53,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">When the governors learned that
Arthur Weasley's daughter . . .</font>

1430
02:21:53,899 --> 02:21:58,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . was taken into the Chamber,
they saw fit to summon me back.</font>

1431
02:21:58,899 --> 02:22:02,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ridiculous.
- Curiously, Lucius, several of them . . .</font>

1432
02:22:03,159 --> 02:22:06,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . were under the impression
that you would curse their family . . .</font>

1433
02:22:06,989 --> 02:22:09,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . if they did not agree
to suspend me in the first place.</font>

1434
02:22:10,290 --> 02:22:13,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How dare you!
- Beg your pardon?</font>

1435
02:22:13,920 --> 02:22:17,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">My sole concern has always been
and will always be . . .</font>

1436
02:22:17,879 --> 02:22:20,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . the welfare of this school . . .</font>

1437
02:22:20,879 --> 02:22:25,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . and, of course, its students.</font>

1438
02:22:29,219 --> 02:22:33,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">The culprit has been identified,
I presume?</font>

1439
02:22:33,809 --> 02:22:35,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

1440
02:22:36,940 --> 02:22:38,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">And?</font>

1441
02:22:39,940 --> 02:22:41,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who was it?</font>

1442
02:22:48,409 --> 02:22:50,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">Voldemort.</font>

1443
02:22:52,120 --> 02:22:57,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only this time he chose to act
through somebody else . . .</font>

1444
02:22:58,129 --> 02:23:01,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . by means of this.</font>

1445
02:23:04,430 --> 02:23:05,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see.</font>

1446
02:23:07,430 --> 02:23:11,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter
discovered it.</font>

1447
02:23:11,969 --> 02:23:15,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">One hopes that no more of Lord
Voldemort's old school-things . . .</font>

1448
02:23:15,809 --> 02:23:19,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . should find their way
into innocent hands.</font>

1449
02:23:19,399 --> 02:23:23,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">The consequences for the one
responsible would be . . .</font>

1450
02:23:23,690 --> 02:23:25,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . severe.</font>

1451
02:23:26,989 --> 02:23:29,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, let us hope . . .</font>

1452
02:23:29,950 --> 02:23:35,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . that Mr. Potter will always
be around to save the day.</font>

1453
02:23:36,250 --> 02:23:40,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry. I will be.</font>

1454
02:23:48,760 --> 02:23:50,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dumbledore.</font>

1455
02:23:51,930 --> 02:23:55,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come, Dobby. We're leaving.</font>

1456
02:24:12,739 --> 02:24:17,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir?
I wonder if I could have that?</font>

1457
02:24:23,629 --> 02:24:25,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Malfoy.</font>

1458
02:24:25,379 --> 02:24:27,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Malfoy!</font>

1459
02:24:28,049 --> 02:24:30,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have something of yours.</font>

1460
02:24:31,889 --> 02:24:34,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mine? I don't know
what you're talking about.</font>

1461
02:24:35,020 --> 02:24:36,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you do, sir.</font>

1462
02:24:36,729 --> 02:24:39,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you slipped the diary
into Ginny Weasley's cauldron . . .</font>

1463
02:24:40,020 --> 02:24:41,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . that day at Diagon Alley.</font>

1464
02:24:42,149 --> 02:24:44,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">You do, do you?</font>

1465
02:24:52,030 --> 02:24:55,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you prove it?</font>

1466
02:25:01,379 --> 02:25:03,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come, Dobby.</font>

1467
02:25:04,840 --> 02:25:06,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">Open it.</font>

1468
02:25:10,379 --> 02:25:11,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dobby.</font>

1469
02:25:12,090 --> 02:25:15,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">Master has given Dobby a sock.</font>

1470
02:25:15,559 --> 02:25:17,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? I didn't give—</font>

1471
02:25:17,809 --> 02:25:21,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Master has presented Dobby
with clothes.</font>

1472
02:25:21,690 --> 02:25:24,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dobby is free.</font>

1473
02:25:31,280 --> 02:25:35,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">You lost me my servant!</font>

1474
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:46,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">You shall not harm Harry Potter.</font>

1475
02:25:58,139 --> 02:26:01,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your parents were
meddlesome fools too.</font>

1476
02:26:02,020 --> 02:26:05,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mark my words, Potter.
One day soon . . .</font>

1477
02:26:05,360 --> 02:26:10,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . you are going to meet
the same sticky end.</font>

1478
02:26:16,280 --> 02:26:22,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry Potter freed Dobby.
How can Dobby ever repay him?</font>

1479
02:26:22,540 --> 02:26:26,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Just promise me something.
- Anything, sir.</font>

1480
02:26:28,750 --> 02:26:31,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never try to save my life again.</font>

1481
02:26:37,350 --> 02:26:40,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Welcome back, Sir Nicholas.
- Thank you.</font>

1482
02:26:40,639 --> 02:26:43,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Good evening, Sir Nicholas.
- Good evening.</font>

1483
02:26:43,190 --> 02:26:46,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Good to see you, Sir Nicholas.
- Thank you.</font>

1484
02:26:47,479 --> 02:26:49,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello.</font>

1485
02:26:51,399 --> 02:26:56,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hermione! Welcome back.
- Thanks, Sir Nicholas.</font>

1486
02:26:59,290 --> 02:27:02,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry. It's Hermione.</font>

1487
02:27:29,440 --> 02:27:33,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Welcome back, Hermione.
- It's good to be back.</font>

1488
02:27:33,319 --> 02:27:35,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Congratulations.
I can't believe you solved it.</font>

1489
02:27:36,069 --> 02:27:38,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">We had loads of help from you.</font>

1490
02:27:38,489 --> 02:27:41,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We couldn't have done it without you.
- Thanks.</font>

1491
02:27:43,540 --> 02:27:46,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could I have your attention, please?</font>

1492
02:27:50,670 --> 02:27:53,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Before we begin the feast . . .</font>

1493
02:27:53,340 --> 02:27:59,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . let us have a round of applause
for Professor Sprout, Madam Pomfrey . . .</font>

1494
02:27:59,760 --> 02:28:03,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . whose Mandrake juice has been
so successfully administered . . .</font>

1495
02:28:04,059 --> 02:28:06,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . to all who had been Petrified.</font>

1496
02:28:17,239 --> 02:28:20,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Also, in light of the recent events . . .</font>

1497
02:28:20,409 --> 02:28:22,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . as a school treat . . .</font>

1498
02:28:22,739 --> 02:28:26,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . all exams have been canceled.</font>

1499
02:28:29,379 --> 02:28:30,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no.</font>

1500
02:28:47,889 --> 02:28:49,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry I'm late.</font>

1501
02:28:55,989 --> 02:29:00,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">The owl that delivered my release papers
got all lost and confused.</font>

1502
02:29:00,739 --> 02:29:04,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some ruddy bird called Errol.</font>

1503
02:29:19,799 --> 02:29:25,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'd just like to say that if it hadn't
been for you, Harry and Ron . . .</font>

1504
02:29:26,020 --> 02:29:28,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . and Hermione, of course . . .</font>

1505
02:29:29,639 --> 02:29:33,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . .l would still be you-know-where . . .</font>

1506
02:29:33,899 --> 02:29:37,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">. . . so I'd just like to say thanks.</font>

1507
02:29:46,870 --> 02:29:49,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no Hogwarts
without you, Hagrid.</font>
