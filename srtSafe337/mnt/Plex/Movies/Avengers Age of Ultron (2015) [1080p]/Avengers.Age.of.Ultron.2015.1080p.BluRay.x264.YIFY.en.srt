No, no, wounded screams.</font>

127
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,440

137
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:59,590

147
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:21,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, yes, of course. A victory

to the Chitauri and Hydra.</font>

150
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:29,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, yes, revels.</font>

151
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:04,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lab's all set up, boss.</font>

152
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, he's the boss.</font>

153
00:15:06,029 --> 00:15:08,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just pay for everything
and design everything</font>

154
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:10,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">and make everyone look cooler.</font>

155
00:15:10,289 --> 00:15:11,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the word on Strucker?</font>

156
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:12,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">NATO's got him.</font>

157
00:15:12,789 --> 00:15:13,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">The two Enhanced?</font>

158
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:16,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wanda and Pietro Maximoff.
Twins.</font>

159
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:19,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Orphaned at 10 when a shell
collapsed their apartment building.</font>

00:15:19,629 --> 00:15:22,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sokovia's had a rough history.</font>

161
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:25,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's nowhere special, but it's on
the way to everywhere special.</font>

162
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:26,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Their abilities?</font>

163
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:29,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's got increased metabolism and
improved thermal homeostasis.</font>

164
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:34,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her thing is neuroelectric interfacing,
telekinesis, mental manipulation.</font>

165
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's fast and she's weird.</font>

166
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:38,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, they're gonna
show up again.</font>

167
00:15:39,649 --> 00:15:43,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Agreed. File says they volunteered
for Strucker's experiments.</font>

168
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:45,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's nuts.
- Right.</font>

169
00:15:45,659 --> 00:15:48,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">What kind of monster would let a
German scientist experiment on them</font>

171
00:15:50,289 --> 00:15:52,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not at war, Captain.</font>

172
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">They are.</font>

173
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:25,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">How's he doing?</font>

174
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:26,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unfortunately,
he's still Barton.</font>

175
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's terrible.</font>

176
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:29,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's fine. He's thirsty.</font>

177
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:32,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. Look alive, Jarvis.
It's playtime.</font>

178
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've only got a couple of
days with this joystick,</font>

179
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">so let's make the most of it.</font>

180
00:16:37,169 --> 00:16:40,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Update me on the structural

182
00:16:44,009 --> 00:16:46,049

I can't quantify.</i></font>

183
00:16:46,129 --> 00:16:47,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">So there's elements you can?</font>

184
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,720
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>The jewel appears to be
a protective housing</i></font>

185

<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>for something inside,</i></font>

186
00:16:51,389 --> 00:16:52,720
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>something powerful.</i></font>

187
00:16:52,809 --> 00:16:53,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like a reactor?</font>

188
00:16:54,059 --> 00:16:55,309
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Like a computer.</i></font>

189
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,559
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I believe I'm deciphering code.</i></font>

190
00:16:59,899 --> 00:17:01,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you sure he's gonna be okay?</font>

191
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:05,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pretending to need this guy
really brings the team together.</font>

192
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no possibility
of deterioration.</font>

193

bonding with simulacra.</font>

196
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,619

197
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">the Regeneration Cradle could
do this in 20 minutes.</font>

198
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:21,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's flat-lining. Call it. Time?</font>

199
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:24,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no, I'm
gonna live forever.</font>

200
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:27,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm gonna be made of plastic.
- Here's your beverage.</font>

201
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:28,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll be made of you, Mr.
Barton.</font>

202
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:30,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your own girlfriend won't be
able to tell the difference.</font>

203
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't have a girlfriend.</font>

204
00:17:32,049 --> 00:17:33,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">That I can't fix.</font>

205
00:17:34,099 --> 00:17:36,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the next thing, Tony.</font>

206
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your clunky metal suits are
gonna be left in the dust.</font>

207
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:40,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is exactly the plan.</font>

208
00:17:41,109 --> 00:17:43,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, Helen, I expect to see
you at the party on Saturday.</font>

209
00:17:44,019 --> 00:17:46,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unlike you, I don't have a
lot of time for parties.</font>

210
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will Thor be there?</font>

211
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:52,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the rumpus?</font>

212
00:17:52,869 --> 00:17:54,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, the scepter.</font>

213
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:59,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see, we were wondering how
Strucker got so inventive.</font>

214
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:03,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I've been analyzing
the gem inside.</font>

215
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">You may recognize...</font>

216
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:08,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Jarvis.
<i>- Doctor.</i></font>

217
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:12,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Started out, Jarvis was
just a natural language UI.</font>

218
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now he runs the Iron Legion.</font>

219
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:17,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">He runs more of the business
than anyone besides Pepper.</font>

220
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:19,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Top of the line.
- Yes.</font>

221
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,690
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I suspect not for long.</i></font>

222
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:22,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Meet the competition.</font>

223
00:18:28,819 --> 00:18:30,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's beautiful.
- If you had to guess,</font>

224
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">what's it look like it's doing?</font>

225
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:33,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like it's thinking.</font>

226
00:18:33,819 --> 00:18:35,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, this could be...</font>

227
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:38,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not a human mind.</font>

228
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, look at this.</font>

229
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're like neurons firing.</font>

230
00:18:43,329 --> 00:18:46,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Down in Strucker's lab, I saw some
fairly advanced robotics work.</font>

231
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:50,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">They deep-sixed the data,</font>

232
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:53,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I gotta guess he was knocking
on a very particular door.</font>

233
00:18:55,299 --> 00:18:56,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Artificial intelligence.</font>

234
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:02,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">This could be it, Bruce. This could
be the key to creating Ultron.</font>

235
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:06,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought Ultron was a fantasy.</font>

236
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:07,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yesterday it was.</font>

237
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we can harness this power,</font>

238
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">apply it to my Iron
Legion protocol?</font>

239
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a man-sized "if."</font>

240
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:18,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our job is "if."</font>

241
00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:21,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if you were sipping margaritas
on a sun-drenched beach,</font>

242
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:23,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">turning brown instead of green?</font>

243
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not looking over your
shoulder for Veronica.</font>

244
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't hate. I helped
design Veronica.</font>

245
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:30,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">As a worst-case measure, right?</font>

246
00:19:30,089 --> 00:19:31,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">How about a best case?</font>

247
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:33,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if the world was safe?</font>

248
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if, next time aliens roll
up to the club, and they will,</font>

249
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">they couldn't get
past the bouncer?</font>

250
00:19:38,849 --> 00:19:42,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">The only people threatening
the planet would be people.</font>

251
00:19:42,269 --> 00:19:44,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to apply this
to the Ultron program.</font>

252
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:47,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">But Jarvis can't download a
data schematic this dense.</font>

253
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:49,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can only do it while
we have the scepter here.</font>

254
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:51,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's three days.
Give me three days.</font>

255
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:53,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you're going for
artificial intelligence,</font>

256
00:19:53,069 --> 00:19:54,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you don't want
to tell the team?</font>

257
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:56,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right. That's right.
You know why?</font>

258
00:19:57,069 --> 00:19:58,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because we don't have time
for a city hall debate.</font>

259
00:19:58,869 --> 00:20:02,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to hear "the man was
not meant to meddle" medley.</font>

260
00:20:02,539 --> 00:20:04,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see a suit of armor
around the world.</font>

261
00:20:05,369 --> 00:20:06,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sounds like a cold world, Tony.</font>

262
00:20:07,589 --> 00:20:09,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've seen colder.</font>

263
00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:15,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">This one, this very vulnerable
blue one, it needs Ultron.</font>

264
00:20:20,059 --> 00:20:22,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peace in our time.</font>

265
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:25,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Imagine that.</font>

266
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did we miss?</font>

267
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:11,269
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I'll continue to run
variations on the interface.</i></font>

268

prepare for your guests.</i></font>

269
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,740
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I'll notify you if there
are any developments.</i></font>

270
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:18,819

271
00:21:18,859 --> 00:21:20,240
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Enjoy yourself, sir.</i></font>

272
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:22,329

274
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,130

They can't mean...</i></font>

298
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:34,569
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- You are in distress.
- No. Yes.</i></font>

299
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:36,940
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>If you will just allow me
to contact Mr. Stark...</i></font>

300
00:22:37,029 --> 00:22:39,029
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Why do you call him "sir"?</i></font>

301
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:42,410
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I believe your intentions
to be hostile.</i></font>

302
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:46,490
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I'm here to help.</i></font>

303
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:50,250
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Stop. Please, may I...</i></font>

304
00:22:50,329 --> 00:22:52,079
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>May I...</i></font>

305
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:21,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come back, come back, come back.</font>

306
00:23:21,779 --> 00:23:23,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, you know, the suit can
take the weight, right?</font>

307
00:23:24,869 --> 00:23:28,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I take the tank, fly it right
up to the general's palace,</font>

308
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:29,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">drop it at his feet.</font>

309
00:23:29,619 --> 00:23:31,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm, like, "Boom. You
looking for this?"</font>

310
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:37,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Boom. Are you looking for..."
Why do I even talk to you guys?</font>

311
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everywhere else,
that story kills.</font>

312
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:40,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the whole story?</font>

313
00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:42,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, it's a War Machine story.</font>

314
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:44,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's very good, then.</font>

315
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:45,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's impressive.</font>

316
00:23:46,099 --> 00:23:47,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quality save.</font>

317
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:50,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So, no Pepper? She's not coming?
- No.</font>

318
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:53,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about Jane? Where are
the ladies, gentlemen?</font>

319
00:23:53,809 --> 00:23:56,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ms. Potts has a company to run.</font>

320
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:58,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I'm not even sure
what country Jane's in.</font>

321

<font color="#FFFFFF">Her work on the Convergence</font>

322
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">has made her the world's
foremost astronomer.</font>

323
00:24:01,779 --> 00:24:03,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the company that Pepper runs</font>

324
00:24:03,779 --> 00:24:06,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">is the largest tech conglomerate on Earth.
It's pretty exciting.</font>

325
00:24:06,369 --> 00:24:09,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's even talk of Jane
getting a Nobel Prize.</font>

326
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:11,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, they must be busy,</font>

327
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">because they would hate missing
you guys get together.</font>

328
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:16,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Testosterone!
- Oh, my goodness.</font>

329
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:18,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Excuse me.
- Want a lozenge?</font>

330
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">But Jane's better.</font>

331
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:25,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sounds like a hell of a fight.
Sorry I missed it.</font>

332
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I had known it was
gonna be a firefight,</font>

333
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">I absolutely would have called.</font>

334
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:31,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no. I'm not actually sorry.
I'm just trying to sound tough.</font>

335
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:35,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm very happy chasing cold leads
on our missing persons case.</font>

336
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:38,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Avenging is your world.</font>

337
00:24:39,819 --> 00:24:41,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your world is crazy.</font>

338
00:24:41,779 --> 00:24:43,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be it ever so humble.</font>

339
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">You find a place
in Brooklyn yet?</font>

340
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think I can afford
a place in Brooklyn.</font>

341
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, home is home, you know?</font>

342
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">I fly right up to the general's
palace, I drop it at his feet,</font>

00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:57,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm, like, "Boom. You
looking for this?"</font>

344
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,220

345
00:25:04,259 --> 00:25:06,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no. See this...</font>

346
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">This was aged for 1,000 years</font>

347
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:11,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the barrels built from the
wreck of Grunhel's fleet.</font>

350
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:18,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop trying to scare us.
Come on.</font>

351
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

352
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excelsior.</font>

353
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:38,289

up working in a dump like this?</font>

354
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:41,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fella done me wrong.</font>

355
00:25:42,289 --> 00:25:44,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got lousy taste in men, kid.</font>

356
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:47,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not so bad.</font>

357
00:25:48,089 --> 00:25:49,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, he has a temper.</font>

358
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:52,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Deep down, he's all fluff.</font>

359
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:56,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fact is, he's not like
anybody I've ever known.</font>

360
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">All my friends are fighters.</font>

361
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">And here comes this guy,</font>

362
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:10,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">spends his life avoiding the fight
because he knows he'll win.</font>

363
00:26:11,619 --> 00:26:13,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sounds amazing.</font>

364
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:14,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's also a huge dork.</font>

365
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:17,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chicks dig that.</font>

366
00:26:19,789 --> 00:26:23,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what do you think?
Should I fight this,</font>

367
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:24,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">or run with it?</font>

368
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">Run with it, right? Or did he...
Was he...</font>

369
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:32,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did he do that
was so wrong to you?</font>

370
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not a damn thing.</font>

371
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:38,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">But never say never.</font>

372
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's nice.</font>

373
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is?</font>

374
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:45,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">You and Romanoff.</font>

375
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:48,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, we haven't... That wasn't...
It's okay.</font>

376
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:50,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody's breaking any bylaws.</font>

377
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:53,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just she's not the most
open person in the world.</font>

378
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:55,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">But with you she
seems very relaxed.</font>

379
00:26:56,329 --> 00:26:59,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Natasha, she's just...
She likes to flirt.</font>

380
00:27:00,289 --> 00:27:02,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've seen her flirt, up close.</font>

381
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">This ain't that.</font>

382
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look,</font>

383
00:27:08,089 --> 00:27:11,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">as maybe the world's leading authority
on waiting too long, don't.</font>

384
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">You both deserve a win.</font>

385
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you mean "up close"?</font>

386
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:24,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it's a trick.</font>

387
00:27:24,859 --> 00:27:25,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, it's much
more than that.</font>

389
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:31,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever, man! It's a trick.</font>

390
00:27:31,819 --> 00:27:33,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, be my guest.</font>

391
00:27:34,529 --> 00:27:35,529

- Really?</font>

392
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,779

00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:38,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is gonna be beautiful.</font>

394
00:27:38,539 --> 00:27:39,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clint, you've had a tough week.</font>

395
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">We won't hold it against you
if you can't get it up.</font>

396
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know I've seen
this before, right?</font>

397
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:49,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">I still don't know
how you do it!</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Smell the silent judgment?</font>

399
00:27:50,589 --> 00:27:51,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, Stark, by all means.</font>

400
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:55,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

401
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:58,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never one to shrink from
an honest challenge.</font>

402
00:27:58,430 --> 00:27:59,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get after it.</font>

403
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:00,599

- Physics.</font>

404

I then rule Asgard?</font>

405
00:28:03,809 --> 00:28:05,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, of course.</font>

00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:23,750

410
00:28:23,829 --> 00:28:24,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just represent. Pull.</font>

411
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, let's go.</font>

412
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:38,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go ahead, Steve. No pressure.</font>

413
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:42,430

00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:57,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no. That's not a

00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Steve, he said a
bad language word.</font>

420
00:29:03,289 --> 00:29:04,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you tell
everyone about that?</font>

421
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,460

Like a security code.</font>

00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:22,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or, no, not yet.</font>

446
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not this chrysalis.</font>

447
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:26,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I'm ready.</font>

448
00:30:27,369 --> 00:30:29,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm on mission.</font>

449
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What mission?
- Peace in our time.</font>

450
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:47,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rhodey!</font>

451
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:57,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry.</font>

452
00:30:57,779 --> 00:30:58,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Don't turn green.
- I won't.</font>

453
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:13,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on!</font>

454
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:32,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Stark!
<i>- We are here to help.</i></font>

455
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">One sec. One sec, I got this.</font>

456
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:35,269
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>We are here to help.</i></font>

457
00:31:37,859 --> 00:31:39,940
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Please back away.</i></font>

458
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:45,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thor!</font>

459
00:31:46,579 --> 00:31:47,950
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>is unsafe... is unsafe...</i></font>

460
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:50,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Come on! That's the one.
<i>- ... is unsafe.</i></font>

461
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:55,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Cap!</font>

462
00:32:02,089 --> 00:32:03,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was dramatic.</font>

463
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:07,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, I know you mean well.</font>

464
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:09,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just didn't
think it through.</font>

465
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:14,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to protect the world but
you don't want it to change.</font>

466
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:17,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">How is humanity saved</font>

467
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">if it's not allowed to evolve?</font>

468
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">With these? These puppets.</font>

469
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's only one path to peace.</font>

470
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Avengers' extinction.</font>

471
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:44,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had strings, but now I'm free.</font>

472
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:52,680
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>There are no strings on me.</i></font>

473
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:57,859
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>There are no strings on me.</i></font>

474
00:32:58,019 --> 00:33:00,730
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>But you can see There
are no strings on me.</i></font>

475
00:33:03,029 --> 00:33:05,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">All our work is gone.</font>

476
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:07,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ultron cleared out. He used the
Internet as an escape hatch.</font>

477
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:09,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ultron.</font>

478
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:12,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's been in everything.
Files, surveillance.</font>

479
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">Probably knows more about us
than we know about each other.</font>

480
00:33:15,289 --> 00:33:17,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's in your files,
he's in the Internet.</font>

481
00:33:17,539 --> 00:33:20,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if he decides to access
something a little more exciting?</font>

482
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:22,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nuclear codes.</font>

483
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:26,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, we need to make some
calls, assuming we still can.</font>

484
00:33:26,259 --> 00:33:28,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nukes? He said he
wanted us dead.</font>

485
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:31,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">He didn't say "dead."
He said "extinct."</font>

486
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:32,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">He also said he killed somebody.</font>

487
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:34,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">There wasn't anyone
else in the building.</font>

488
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:36,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, there was.</font>

489
00:33:43,859 --> 00:33:45,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

490
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:50,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is insane.</font>

491
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:52,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jarvis was the first
line of defense.</font>

492
00:33:52,579 --> 00:33:54,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">He would have shut Ultron down.
It makes sense.</font>

493
00:33:54,539 --> 00:33:57,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Ultron could have
assimilated Jarvis.</font>

494
00:33:57,670 --> 00:34:00,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">This isn't strategy. This is</font>

495
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">rage.</font>

496
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:05,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's going around.</font>

497
00:34:05,509 --> 00:34:06,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, use your words, buddy.</font>

498
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:09,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have more than enough words
to describe you, Stark.</font>

499
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:10,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thor. The Legionnaire.</font>

500
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:17,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Trail went cold about 100 miles
out, but it's headed north.</font>

501
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:19,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it has the scepter.</font>

502
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now we have to
retrieve it, again.</font>

503
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Genie's out of that bottle.</font>

504
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clear and present is Ultron.</font>

505
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:26,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't understand.</font>

506
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:28,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">You built this program.</font>

507
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why is it trying to kill us?</font>

508
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:39,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think this is funny?</font>

509
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

510
00:34:42,329 --> 00:34:44,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's probably not, right?</font>

511
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:47,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is very terrible.
Is it so...</font>

512
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it so... It is.
It's so terrible.</font>

513
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:51,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">This could have been avoided</font>

514
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:53,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you hadn't played with
something you don't understand.</font>

515
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:56,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It is funny.</font>

516
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a hoot that you don't
get why we need this.</font>

517
00:34:58,809 --> 00:35:00,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tony, maybe this might
not be the time.</font>

518
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:03,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really? That's it?</font>

519
00:35:03,269 --> 00:35:06,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just roll over, show your
belly every time somebody snarls?</font>

520
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only when I've created
a murder bot.</font>

521
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:11,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">We didn't. We weren't even close.
Were we close to an interface?</font>

522
00:35:11,489 --> 00:35:15,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you did something right.
And you did it right here.</font>

523
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:16,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Avengers were supposed to
be different than S.H.I.E.L.D.</font>

524
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:20,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anybody remember when I carried
a nuke through a wormhole?</font>

525
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:21,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, it's never come up.
- Saved New York?</font>

526
00:35:21,829 --> 00:35:24,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Never heard that.
- Recall that?</font>

527
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:28,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">A hostile alien army came
charging through a hole in space.</font>

528
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:30,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're standing 300
feet below it.</font>

529
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:33,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're the Avengers.</font>

530
00:35:33,719 --> 00:35:35,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can bust arms dealers
all the livelong day,</font>

531
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:38,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">but that up there, that's...</font>

532
00:35:38,969 --> 00:35:40,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the endgame.</font>

533
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">How were you guys
planning on beating that?</font>

534
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:45,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Together.</font>

535
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:49,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll lose.</font>

536
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:53,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then we'll do that
together, too.</font>

537
00:35:56,329 --> 00:35:58,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thor's right. Ultron's
calling us out.</font>

538
00:35:59,369 --> 00:36:01,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'd like to find him
before he's ready for us.</font>

539
00:36:02,539 --> 00:36:06,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">The world's a big place. Let's
start making it smaller.</font>

540
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:31,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Talk, and if you are
wasting our time...</font>

541
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:36,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you know this church is in
the exact center of the city?</font>

542
00:36:36,199 --> 00:36:40,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">The elders decreed it so that everyone
could be equally close to God.</font>

543
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:42,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like that.</font>

544
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:44,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">The geometry of belief.</font>

545
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:49,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're wondering why you
can't look inside my head.</font>

546
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes it's hard.</font>

547
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">But sooner or later,
every man shows himself.</font>

548
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:57,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure they do.</font>

549
00:36:58,429 --> 00:37:00,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you needed something
more than a man.</font>

550
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:04,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why you let Stark
take the scepter.</font>

551
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:05,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't expect,</font>

552
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:10,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I saw Stark's fear.</font>

553
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:11,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew it would control him.</font>

554
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:13,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make him self-destruct.</font>

555
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone creates the
thing they dread.</font>

556
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:19,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Men of peace create
engines of war.</font>

557
00:37:20,329 --> 00:37:22,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Invaders create Avengers.</font>

558
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:24,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">People create</font>

559
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:27,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">smaller people?</font>

560
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:30,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Children." I lost
the word, there.</font>

561
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:34,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Children designed
to supplant them,</font>

562
00:37:34,969 --> 00:37:37,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">to help them end.</font>

563
00:37:38,469 --> 00:37:41,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that why you've come,
to end the Avengers?</font>

564
00:37:41,929 --> 00:37:44,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've come to save the world.</font>

565
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:47,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">But also... Yeah.</font>

566
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:53,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll move out right away.</font>

567
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:56,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a start, but there's something
we need to begin the real work.</font>

568
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">- All of these are...
- Me.</font>

569
00:37:59,489 --> 00:38:02,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have what the Avengers never will.
Harmony.</font>

570
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:05,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're discordant.
Disconnected.</font>

571
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:07,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stark's already got them
turning on each other.</font>

572
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:09,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">And when you get inside the
rest of their heads...</font>

573
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone's plan is
not to kill them.</font>

574
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:13,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">And make them martyrs?</font>

575
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:15,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need patience.</font>

576
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:17,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Need to see the big picture.</font>

577
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:21,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't see the big picture.
I have a little picture.</font>

578
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:23,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">I take it out and look at it,</font>

579
00:38:24,809 --> 00:38:26,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">every day.</font>

580
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:28,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">You lost your parents in the bombings.
I've seen the records.</font>

581
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">The records are not the picture.</font>

582
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:31,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pietro.</font>

583
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, please.</font>

584
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:38,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were 10 years old. Having
dinner, the four of us.</font>

585
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">When the first shell
hits, two floors below,</font>

586
00:38:42,369 --> 00:38:44,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">it makes a hole in the floor.</font>

587
00:38:44,539 --> 00:38:46,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's big.</font>

588
00:38:47,449 --> 00:38:48,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our parents go in</font>

589
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the whole building
starts coming apart.</font>

590
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:54,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">I grab her,</font>

591
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:57,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">roll under the bed, and
the second shell hits.</font>

592
00:38:57,719 --> 00:38:59,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it doesn't go off.</font>

593
00:39:01,889 --> 00:39:03,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">It just</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">sits there in the rubble.</font>

595
00:39:06,889 --> 00:39:09,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three feet from our faces.</font>

596
00:39:10,349 --> 00:39:13,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">And on the side of the
shell is painted one word.</font>

597

<font color="#FFFFFF">"Stark."</font>

598
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were trapped for two days.</font>

599
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:21,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every effort to save us,</font>

600
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:23,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">every shift in the bricks,</font>

601
00:39:23,659 --> 00:39:26,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think, "This will set it off."</font>

602
00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:33,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">We wait for two days for
Tony Stark to kill us.</font>

603
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:37,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know what they are.</font>

604
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:42,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wondered why only you two
survived Strucker's experiments.</font>

605
00:39:43,429 --> 00:39:44,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now I don't.</font>

606
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">We will make it right.</font>

607
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:48,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">You and I can hurt them.</font>

608
00:39:50,139 --> 00:39:53,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you will tear them apart</font>

609
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,360
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>from the inside.</i></font>

They have someone in common.</font>

620

<font color="#FFFFFF">Not anymore.</font>

621
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:33,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a negative.
I answer to you.</font>

622
00:40:35,269 --> 00:40:36,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, ma'am.</font>

623
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Barton. Might have something.</font>

624
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">I gotta go.</font>

625
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:41,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who was that?</font>

626
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:43,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Girlfriend.</font>

627
00:40:45,869 --> 00:40:47,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's this?</font>

628
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:49,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">A message. Ultron
killed Strucker.</font>

629
00:40:50,619 --> 00:40:53,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he did a Banksy at the
crime scene, just for us.</font>

630
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:55,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a smoke screen.</font>

631
00:40:55,329 --> 00:40:57,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why send a message when
you've just given a speech?</font>

632
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Strucker knew something that
Ultron wanted us to miss.</font>

633
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:01,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I bet he... Yeah.</font>

634
00:41:02,469 --> 00:41:04,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything we had on
Strucker's been erased.</font>

635
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not everything.</font>

636

<font color="#FFFFFF">Known associates.</font>

637
00:41:09,929 --> 00:41:11,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Baron Strucker had
a lot of friends.</font>

638
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:13,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, these people
are all horrible.</font>

639
00:41:13,269 --> 00:41:15,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait. I know that guy.</font>

640
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:19,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">From back in the day. He
operates off the African coast.</font>

00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:20,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Black market arms.</font>

642
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are conventions. All right?
You meet people.</font>

643
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't sell him anything.</font>

644
00:41:25,699 --> 00:41:27,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was talking about finding
something new, a game-changer.</font>

645
00:41:27,909 --> 00:41:29,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was all very Ahab.</font>

646
00:41:29,449 --> 00:41:30,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">This?</font>

647
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:32,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a tattoo, I don't
think he had it.</font>

648
00:41:32,369 --> 00:41:35,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those are tattoos,
this is a brand.</font>

649
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:39,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. It's a word in an African
dialect meaning "thief."</font>

650
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:41,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">In a much less friendly way.</font>

651
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What dialect?
- Wakanada.</font>

652
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:45,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wakanda.</font>

653
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:49,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">If this guy got out of Wakanda
with some of their trade goods...</font>

654
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought your father said
he got the last of it.</font>

655
00:41:51,219 --> 00:41:54,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't follow. What
comes out of Wakanda?</font>

656
00:41:55,769 --> 00:41:57,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">The strongest metal on Earth.</font>

657
00:41:59,019 --> 00:42:00,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is this guy now?</font>

658
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:06,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Salvage Yard African Coast.</font>

659
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't tell me your
men swindled you.</font>

660
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:32,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">I sent you six short-range heat-seekers
and got a boat full of rusted parts.</font>

661
00:42:33,099 --> 00:42:34,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, you will make it right,</font>

662
00:42:34,519 --> 00:42:37,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">or the next missile I send you
will come very much faster.</font>

663
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:42,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, minister, where were we?</font>

664
00:43:13,679 --> 00:43:16,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. The Enhanced.</font>

665
00:43:17,309 --> 00:43:19,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Strucker's prize pupils.</font>

666
00:43:21,809 --> 00:43:23,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you want a candy?</font>

667
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:27,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was sorry to hear
about Strucker.</font>

668
00:43:27,989 --> 00:43:31,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">But then, he knew what kind of
world he was helping create.</font>

669
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:33,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Human life. Not a growth market.</font>

670
00:43:36,449 --> 00:43:38,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">You didn't know?</font>

671
00:43:38,579 --> 00:43:42,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this your first time
intimidating someone?</font>

672
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:45,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm afraid I'm not that afraid.</font>

673
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:47,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody is afraid
of something.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">They make lights,
disco lights...</font>

677
00:43:54,679 --> 00:43:56,719

prey, and then...</font>

678
00:43:57,849 --> 00:44:00,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw a documentary.
It was terrifying.</font>

679
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:08,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">So if you're going to
fiddle with my brain</font>

680
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:11,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">and make me see a
giant cuttlefish,</font>

681
00:44:11,530 --> 00:44:13,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">then I know you
don't do business.</font>

682
00:44:13,699 --> 00:44:16,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I know you're not in charge.</font>

683
00:44:16,199 --> 00:44:17,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I only deal</font>

684
00:44:18,579 --> 00:44:20,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">with the man in charge.</font>

685
00:44:25,289 --> 00:44:27,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is no man in charge.</font>

686
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:32,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's talk business.</font>

687
00:44:45,269 --> 00:44:48,650

689
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:57,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, it came at
great personal cost.</font>

690
00:44:57,409 --> 00:44:59,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's worth billions.</font>

691
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:04,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now so are you.</font>

692
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:07,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all under your
dummy holdings.</font>

693
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:09,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Finance is so weird.</font>

694
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:12,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I always say,</font>

00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:14,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Keep your friends rich
and your enemies rich"</font>

696
00:45:14,679 --> 00:45:16,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">"and wait to find out
which is which."</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Stark.</font>

698
00:45:21,769 --> 00:45:23,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

699
00:45:23,099 --> 00:45:25,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tony Stark used to say that.</font>

700
00:45:26,269 --> 00:45:27,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">To me.</font>

701
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:29,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're one of his.</font>

702
00:45:29,769 --> 00:45:31,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? I'm not...</font>

703
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not.</font>

704
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:36,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think I'm one
of Stark's puppets?</font>

705
00:45:36,659 --> 00:45:37,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">His hollow men?</font>

706
00:45:38,199 --> 00:45:40,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, look at me. Do
I look like Iron Man?</font>

707
00:45:40,619 --> 00:45:41,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stark is nothing!</font>

708
00:45:43,619 --> 00:45:45,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry. I'm...</font>

709
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:48,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure that's gonna be okay.
I'm sorry.</font>

710
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:49,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just that I
don't understand.</font>

711
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't compare me with Stark!</font>

712
00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:56,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a thing with me.</font>

713
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:58,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stark is... He's a sickness!</font>

714
00:45:58,260 --> 00:45:59,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Junior.</font>

715
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:03,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're gonna break
your old man's heart.</font>

716
00:46:04,639 --> 00:46:05,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I have to.</font>

717
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:09,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody has to break anything.</font>

718
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:11,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clearly you've never
made an omelet.</font>

719
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:12,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">He beat me by one second.</font>

720
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:15,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. He's funny.</font>

721
00:46:15,489 --> 00:46:16,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Stark.</font>

722
00:46:17,699 --> 00:46:19,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's what? Comfortable?</font>

723
00:46:20,989 --> 00:46:22,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like old times?</font>

724
00:46:22,489 --> 00:46:23,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">This was never my life.</font>

725
00:46:23,619 --> 00:46:25,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">You two can still
walk away from this.</font>

726
00:46:25,159 --> 00:46:26,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">We will.</font>

727
00:46:26,539 --> 00:46:27,789

then let us keep it.</font>

733
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:45,519

"peace" with "quiet."</font>

734
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:47,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the vibranium for?</font>

735
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:48,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm glad you asked that,</font>

736
00:46:48,769 --> 00:46:52,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">because I wanted to take this
time to explain my evil plan.</font>

- Which ones?</font>

759
00:50:09,429 --> 00:50:10,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">You never fail.</font>

760
00:50:33,579 --> 00:50:35,500

765
00:50:52,929 --> 00:50:55,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">They see you leading us to Hel.</font>

766
00:50:56,269 --> 00:50:57,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wake up!</font>

767

00:51:16,449 --> 00:51:18,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can still save you!</font>

771
00:51:18,329 --> 00:51:21,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're all dead! Can you not see?</font>

772
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:28,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a destroyer, Odinson.</font>

773
00:51:31,889 --> 00:51:34,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">See where your power leads.</font>

774
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:45,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sloppy.</font>

775
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:48,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pretending to fail.</font>

776
00:51:49,650 --> 00:51:51,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">The ceremony is necessary</font>

777
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:54,449

place in the world.</font>

778

779
00:51:56,659 --> 00:51:57,829

<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to kill him.</font>

782
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:08,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'll be right back.
- No.</font>

783

786
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:19,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want the big one.</font>

787
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:32,070

789
00:52:34,369 --> 00:52:37,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course not. I'm
already there.</font>

790
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll catch on.</font>

791
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:40,960

Not for a while.</font>

set this up when I joined.</font>

866

883
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:52,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about Nat and Dr. Banner?</font>

884
01:02:52,190 --> 01:02:54,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long has that been going on?</font>

885
01:02:54,530 --> 01:02:55,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Has what?</font>

886
01:02:56,820 --> 01:02:58,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are so cute.</font>

887
01:02:58,820 --> 01:03:00,369

888
01:03:00,989 --> 01:03:03,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll explain when
you're older, Hawkeye.</font>

891
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:10,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nat seems really shaken.</font>

892

<font color="#FFFFFF">But they carry a
big, damn stick.</font>

895
01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:22,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Nat took a serious hit.</font>

896
01:03:23,849 --> 01:03:26,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone's gonna have to
teach them some manners.</font>

897

01:03:35,989 --> 01:03:39,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I see those guys...
Those gods...</font>

901
01:03:41,409 --> 01:03:43,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't think they need me.</font>

902
01:03:43,869 --> 01:03:47,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think they do, which
is a lot scarier.</font>

903
01:03:48,659 --> 01:03:49,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're a mess.</font>

904
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:52,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

905
01:03:53,210 --> 01:03:54,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess they're my mess.</font>

906
01:03:56,210 --> 01:03:58,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need to be sure</font>

907
01:03:58,260 --> 01:04:00,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">that this team is really a team,</font>

908
01:04:00,969 --> 01:04:02,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">and that they have your back.</font>

909
01:04:06,099 --> 01:04:08,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Things are changing for us.</font>

910
01:04:08,769 --> 01:04:11,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">In a few months' time,</font>

911
01:04:11,349 --> 01:04:14,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">you and me are gonna
be outnumbered.</font>

912
01:04:14,230 --> 01:04:15,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need...</font>

913
01:04:18,739 --> 01:04:20,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just be sure.</font>

914
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:22,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, ma'am.</font>

915
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:33,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can feel the difference.</font>

916
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:40,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">U-Gin Genetics Research
Lab Seoul, Korea.</font>

917
01:04:46,889 --> 01:04:49,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Scream, and your
entire staff dies.</font>

918
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:53,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could've killed you,
Helen, the night we met.</font>

919
01:04:53,849 --> 01:04:54,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't.</font>

920
01:04:55,059 --> 01:04:56,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you expect a thank-you note?</font>

921
01:04:56,769 --> 01:04:58,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">I expect you to know why.</font>

922
01:04:59,650 --> 01:05:00,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Cradle.</font>

923
01:05:01,150 --> 01:05:03,199
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>This is the next thing, Tony.</i></font>

924
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:06,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the next me.</font>

925
01:05:06,530 --> 01:05:09,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Regeneration
Cradle prints tissue.</font>

926
01:05:09,289 --> 01:05:10,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">It can't build a living body.</font>

927
01:05:11,079 --> 01:05:12,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">It can. You can.</font>

928
01:05:12,619 --> 01:05:14,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">You lack the materials.</font>

929
01:05:16,289 --> 01:05:17,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a brilliant woman, Helen.</font>

930
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:24,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we all have room to improve.</font>

931
01:05:45,699 --> 01:05:48,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't realize
you were waiting.</font>

932
01:05:48,369 --> 01:05:49,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would've joined you,</font>

933
01:05:49,449 --> 01:05:52,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it didn't seem
like the right time.</font>

934
01:05:53,710 --> 01:05:56,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">They used up all the hot water.</font>

935
01:05:56,670 --> 01:05:58,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should've joined you.</font>

936
01:05:58,210 --> 01:06:00,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Missed our window.</font>

937
01:06:00,670 --> 01:06:02,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did we?</font>

938
01:06:05,510 --> 01:06:07,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">The world just saw the Hulk.</font>

939
01:06:09,219 --> 01:06:11,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">The real Hulk, for
the first time.</font>

940
01:06:14,349 --> 01:06:15,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know I have to leave.</font>

941
01:06:15,519 --> 01:06:17,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">You assume that I have to stay?</font>

942
01:06:19,019 --> 01:06:21,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had this dream.</font>

943
01:06:22,190 --> 01:06:24,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">The kind that seems
normal at the time,</font>

944
01:06:25,030 --> 01:06:28,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">but when you wake...
What did you dream?</font>

945
01:06:29,199 --> 01:06:31,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">That I was an Avenger.</font>

946
01:06:32,869 --> 01:06:36,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">That I was anything more than
the assassin they made me.</font>

947
01:06:38,289 --> 01:06:40,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you're being
hard on yourself.</font>

948
01:06:42,460 --> 01:06:45,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here I was hoping
that was your job.</font>

949
01:06:47,929 --> 01:06:49,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

950
01:06:51,179 --> 01:06:53,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm running with it.</font>

951
01:06:54,230 --> 01:06:55,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">With you.</font>

952
01:06:56,599 --> 01:06:59,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">If running is the plan,</font>

953
01:07:00,059 --> 01:07:01,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">as far as you want.</font>

954
01:07:03,730 --> 01:07:05,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you out of your mind?</font>

955
01:07:10,780 --> 01:07:13,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to understand that...
Natasha,</font>

956
01:07:14,869 --> 01:07:16,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">where can I go?</font>

957
01:07:17,409 --> 01:07:19,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where in the world
am I not a threat?</font>

958
01:07:19,789 --> 01:07:22,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're not a threat to me.
- Are you sure?</font>

959
01:07:23,050 --> 01:07:24,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even if I didn't just...</font>

960
01:07:26,469 --> 01:07:28,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no future with me.</font>

961
01:07:29,550 --> 01:07:33,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't ever... I
can't have this.</font>

962
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:35,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kids.</font>

963
01:07:35,219 --> 01:07:37,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do the math. I physically can't.</font>

964
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:41,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Neither can I.</font>

965
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:49,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the Red Room where
I was trained...</font>

966
01:07:49,780 --> 01:07:52,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where I was raised,</font>

967
01:07:53,239 --> 01:07:55,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">they have a graduation ceremony.</font>

968
01:07:57,500 --> 01:07:59,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">They sterilize you.</font>

969
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:04,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's efficient.</font>

970
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:08,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">One less thing to worry about.</font>

971
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:13,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">The one thing that might
matter more than a mission.</font>

972
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:18,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">Makes everything easier.</font>

973
01:08:19,310 --> 01:08:20,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even killing.</font>

974
01:08:25,649 --> 01:08:28,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">You still think you're the
only monster on the team?</font>

975
01:08:34,949 --> 01:08:37,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, we disappear?</font>

976
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:45,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thor didn't say where he
was going for answers?</font>

977
01:08:46,380 --> 01:08:48,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes my teammates
don't tell me things.</font>

978
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:52,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was kind of hoping Thor
would be the exception.</font>

979
01:08:52,510 --> 01:08:54,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, give him time.</font>

980
01:08:54,300 --> 01:08:56,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't know what the
Maximoff kid showed him.</font>

981
01:08:58,390 --> 01:09:00,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Earth's mightiest heroes."</font>

982
01:09:00,140 --> 01:09:01,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pulled us apart
like cotton candy.</font>

983
01:09:02,020 --> 01:09:03,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seems like you walked
away all right.</font>

984
01:09:06,109 --> 01:09:07,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that a problem?</font>

985
01:09:07,229 --> 01:09:09,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't trust a guy
without a dark side.</font>

986
01:09:10,569 --> 01:09:11,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Call me old-fashioned.</font>

987
01:09:11,739 --> 01:09:14,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, let's just say you
haven't seen it yet.</font>

988
01:09:14,699 --> 01:09:16,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know Ultron is trying
to tear us apart, right?</font>

989
01:09:17,029 --> 01:09:19,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I guess you'd know.</font>

990
01:09:19,369 --> 01:09:20,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whether you'd tell us
is a bit of a question.</font>

991
01:09:20,869 --> 01:09:22,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Banner and I were
doing research.</font>

992
01:09:22,039 --> 01:09:24,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That would affect the team.
- That would end the team!</font>

993
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:25,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Isn't that the mission?</font>

994
01:09:25,750 --> 01:09:27,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Isn't that the "Why We Fight"?</font>

995
01:09:27,210 --> 01:09:29,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we can end the fight.
So we get to go home!</font>

996
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:35,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every time someone tries to
win a war before it starts,</font>

997
01:09:35,220 --> 01:09:37,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">innocent people die. Every time.</font>

998
01:09:40,350 --> 01:09:41,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

999
01:09:41,770 --> 01:09:42,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Stark...</font>

1000
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:44,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clint said you wouldn't mind,</font>

1001
01:09:44,850 --> 01:09:47,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">but our tractor doesn't seem
to want to start at all.</font>

1002
01:09:47,569 --> 01:09:49,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I thought maybe you might...
- Yeah, I'll give her a kick.</font>

1003
01:09:53,399 --> 01:09:55,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't take from my pile.</font>

1004
01:10:05,250 --> 01:10:06,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Deere.</font>

1005
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:10,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me everything.</font>

1006
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:13,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">What ails you?</font>

1007
01:10:13,510 --> 01:10:14,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do me a favor.</font>

1008
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:18,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Try not to bring it to life.</font>

1009
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why, Ms. Barton,
you little minx.</font>

1010
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:23,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">I get it. Maria Hill
called you, right?</font>

1011
01:10:23,390 --> 01:10:24,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was she ever not
working for you?</font>

1012
01:10:24,770 --> 01:10:26,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">Artificial intelligence.</font>

1013
01:10:27,270 --> 01:10:29,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">You never even hesitated.</font>

1014
01:10:29,229 --> 01:10:30,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, it's been a
really long day,</font>

1015
01:10:30,689 --> 01:10:32,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">like Eugene O'Neill long,</font>

1016
01:10:32,439 --> 01:10:34,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">so how's about we skip to the
part where you're useful.</font>

1017
01:10:34,569 --> 01:10:37,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look me in the eye and tell me
you're going to shut him down.</font>

1018
01:10:37,359 --> 01:10:38,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not the director of me.</font>

1019
01:10:39,119 --> 01:10:40,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not the director of anybody.</font>

1020
01:10:41,039 --> 01:10:42,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just an old man</font>

1021
01:10:43,119 --> 01:10:45,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">who cares very much about you.</font>

1022
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:49,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'm the man who
killed the Avengers.</font>

1023
01:10:51,460 --> 01:10:52,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw it.</font>

1024
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:54,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't tell the team.
How could I?</font>

1025
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:57,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw them all dead, Nick.
I felt it.</font>

1026
01:10:57,970 --> 01:10:59,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">The whole world, too.</font>

1027
01:10:59,890 --> 01:11:00,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because of me.</font>

1028
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:03,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wasn't ready.</font>

1029
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:06,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't do all I could.</font>

1030
01:11:07,479 --> 01:11:09,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maximoff girl, she's
working you, Stark.</font>

1031
01:11:10,189 --> 01:11:11,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">Playing on your fear.</font>

1032
01:11:11,319 --> 01:11:13,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wasn't tricked, I was shown.</font>

1033
01:11:13,819 --> 01:11:16,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wasn't a nightmare,
it was my legacy.</font>

1034
01:11:16,199 --> 01:11:18,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">The end of the path
I started us on.</font>

1035
01:11:19,449 --> 01:11:22,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">You come up with some pretty
impressive inventions, Tony.</font>

1036
01:11:23,829 --> 01:11:25,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">War isn't one of them.</font>

1037
01:11:28,710 --> 01:11:30,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">I watched my friends die.</font>

1038
01:11:30,539 --> 01:11:32,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'd think that'd be as
bad as it gets, right?</font>

1039
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nope.</font>

1040
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:37,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">It wasn't the worst part.</font>

1041
01:11:38,010 --> 01:11:39,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">The worst part</font>

1042
01:11:39,930 --> 01:11:41,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">is that you didn't.</font>

1043
01:11:48,020 --> 01:11:49,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll see you tonight.</font>

1044
01:11:50,189 --> 01:11:51,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">Royal Holloway
University of London</font>

1045
01:11:51,859 --> 01:11:53,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like the look.</font>

1046
01:11:54,149 --> 01:11:56,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you're going for
inconspicuous, though, near miss.</font>

1047
01:11:57,109 --> 01:11:58,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need your help.</font>

1048
01:11:58,359 --> 01:11:59,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's nice to be needed.</font>

1049
01:11:59,659 --> 01:12:01,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's dangerous.</font>

1050
01:12:01,779 --> 01:12:03,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd be disappointed
if it wasn't.</font>

1051
01:12:06,539 --> 01:12:10,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ultron took you folks out of
play to buy himself time.</font>

1052
01:12:10,210 --> 01:12:13,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">My contacts all say he's
building something.</font>

1053
01:12:13,250 --> 01:12:15,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">The amount of vibranium
he made off with,</font>

1054
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:17,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think it's
just one thing.</font>

1055
01:12:17,510 --> 01:12:18,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about Ultron himself?</font>

1056
01:12:19,050 --> 01:12:21,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's easy to track.
He's everywhere.</font>

1057
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:24,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">The guy is multiplying faster
than a Catholic rabbit.</font>

1058
01:12:24,890 --> 01:12:27,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">It still doesn't help us get an
angle on any of his plans, though.</font>

1059
01:12:27,850 --> 01:12:29,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is he still going
after launch codes?</font>

1060
01:12:29,229 --> 01:12:30,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, he is.</font>

1061
01:12:30,729 --> 01:12:32,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">But he's not making any headway.</font>

1062
01:12:32,350 --> 01:12:34,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">I cracked the Pentagon's firewall
in high school on a dare.</font>

1063
01:12:34,479 --> 01:12:37,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I contacted our friends
at the Nexus about that.</font>

1064
01:12:37,149 --> 01:12:38,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nexus?</font>

1065
01:12:38,319 --> 01:12:40,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the world
internet hub in Oslo.</font>

1066
01:12:40,359 --> 01:12:42,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every byte of data
flows through there.</font>

1067
01:12:42,409 --> 01:12:43,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fastest access on Earth.</font>

1068
01:12:43,569 --> 01:12:44,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, what did they say?</font>

1069
01:12:44,829 --> 01:12:46,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's fixated on the missiles.</font>

1070
01:12:46,829 --> 01:12:48,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the codes are
constantly being changed.</font>

1071
01:12:48,949 --> 01:12:50,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">By whom?</font>

1072
01:12:51,579 --> 01:12:52,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Parties unknown.</font>

1073
01:12:52,670 --> 01:12:53,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do we have an ally?</font>

1074
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:56,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ultron's got an enemy.
That's not the same thing.</font>

1075
01:12:56,420 --> 01:12:58,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Still, I'd pay folding
money to know who it is.</font>

1076
01:12:58,590 --> 01:12:59,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">I might need to visit Oslo.</font>

1077
01:13:00,260 --> 01:13:01,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Find our unknown.</font>

1078
01:13:01,550 --> 01:13:02,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, this is good times, boss,</font>

1079
01:13:03,050 --> 01:13:04,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I was kind of
hoping when I saw you,</font>

1080
01:13:04,550 --> 01:13:05,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">you'd have more than that.</font>

1081
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:07,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do. I have you.</font>

1082
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:11,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">Back in the day, I had eyes everywhere.
Ears, everywhere else.</font>

1083
01:13:12,100 --> 01:13:15,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">You kids had all the
tech you could dream up.</font>

1084
01:13:16,229 --> 01:13:18,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here we all are, back on Earth,</font>

1085
01:13:18,439 --> 01:13:21,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">with nothing but our wit and
our will to save the world.</font>

1086
01:13:23,529 --> 01:13:25,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ultron says the Avengers
are the only thing</font>

1087
01:13:25,869 --> 01:13:27,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">between him and his mission.</font>

1088
01:13:27,579 --> 01:13:29,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">And whether or not he admits it,</font>

1089
01:13:29,789 --> 01:13:32,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">his mission is
global destruction.</font>

1090
01:13:33,710 --> 01:13:36,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">All this, laid in a grave.</font>

1091
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:39,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">So stand.</font>

1092
01:13:40,380 --> 01:13:42,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Outwit the platinum bastard.</font>

1093
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:44,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Steve doesn't like
that kind of talk.</font>

1094
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:45,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what, Romanoff?</font>

1095
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:48,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, what does he want?</font>

1096
01:13:49,810 --> 01:13:51,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">To become better.</font>

1097
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:53,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">Better than us.</font>

1098
01:13:53,310 --> 01:13:54,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">He keeps building bodies.</font>

1099
01:13:54,850 --> 01:13:56,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Person bodies.</font>

1100
01:13:56,310 --> 01:13:57,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">The human form is inefficient.</font>

1101
01:13:58,109 --> 01:14:00,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Biologically speaking,
we're outmoded.</font>

1102
01:14:00,399 --> 01:14:02,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">But he keeps coming back to it.</font>

1103
01:14:02,399 --> 01:14:04,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">When you two programmed him
to protect the human race,</font>

1104
01:14:04,659 --> 01:14:06,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">you amazingly failed.</font>

1105
01:14:06,239 --> 01:14:08,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">They don't need to be protected.</font>

1106
01:14:08,699 --> 01:14:10,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">They need to evolve.</font>

1107
01:14:12,329 --> 01:14:14,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ultron's going to evolve.</font>

1108
01:14:14,619 --> 01:14:15,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">How?</font>

1109
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Has anyone been in
contact with Helen Cho?</font>

1110
01:14:23,380 --> 01:14:25,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's beautiful.</font>

1111
01:14:25,180 --> 01:14:28,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">The vibranium atoms aren't just
compatible with the tissue cells,</font>

1112
01:14:28,510 --> 01:14:29,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">they're binding them.</font>

1113
01:14:30,220 --> 01:14:31,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">And S.H.I.E.L.D. never
even thought to...</font>

1114
01:14:31,850 --> 01:14:34,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">The most versatile
substance on the planet,</font>

1115
01:14:34,479 --> 01:14:37,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">and they used it
to make a Frisbee.</font>

1116
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:38,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Typical of humans.</font>

1117
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:41,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">They scratch the surface
and never think</font>

1118
01:14:42,899 --> 01:14:44,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">to look within.</font>

1119
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll take Natasha and Clint.</font>

1120
01:14:56,670 --> 01:14:59,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. Strictly recon. I'll hit the
Nexus. I'll join you as soon as I can.</font>

1121
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">If Ultron's really
building a body...</font>

1122
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:03,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll be more powerful
than any of us.</font>

1123
01:15:03,670 --> 01:15:04,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe all of us.</font>

1124
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:07,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">An android designed by a robot.</font>

1125
01:15:07,090 --> 01:15:08,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I really miss the days</font>

1126
01:15:08,390 --> 01:15:10,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">when the weirdest thing
science ever created was me.</font>

1127
01:15:11,100 --> 01:15:12,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll drop Banner
off at the tower.</font>

1128
01:15:12,890 --> 01:15:14,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">You mind if I borrow Ms. Hill?</font>

1129
01:15:14,390 --> 01:15:16,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's all yours. Apparently.</font>

1130
01:15:16,310 --> 01:15:17,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you gonna do?</font>

1131
01:15:17,689 --> 01:15:20,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know. Something
dramatic, I hope.</font>

1132
01:15:24,069 --> 01:15:27,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna finish reflooring that
sunroom as soon as I get back.</font>

1133
01:15:28,029 --> 01:15:30,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, then you'll find another
part of the house to tear apart.</font>

1134
01:15:30,829 --> 01:15:31,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

1135
01:15:32,659 --> 01:15:34,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the last project.</font>

1136
01:15:35,699 --> 01:15:36,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">I promise.</font>

1137
01:15:54,970 --> 01:15:56,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, this is it.</font>

1138
01:15:58,100 --> 01:16:00,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Water of Sight.</font>

1142
01:16:10,529 --> 01:16:12,119

1150
01:16:29,550 --> 01:16:32,220

You bring a magnet.</font>

01:19:39,239 --> 01:19:40,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's uploading himself
into the body.</font>

1201
01:19:40,869 --> 01:19:41,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where?</font>

1202
01:19:43,699 --> 01:19:46,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">The real power is
inside the Cradle.</font>

1203
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:47,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">The gem,</font>

1204
01:19:48,170 --> 01:19:50,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">its power is uncontainable.</font>

1205
01:19:51,789 --> 01:19:53,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't just blow it up.</font>

1206
01:19:54,380 --> 01:19:56,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have to get the
Cradle to Stark.</font>

1207
01:19:56,720 --> 01:19:57,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">First, I have to find it.</font>

1208
01:19:58,130 --> 01:19:59,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go.</font>

1209
01:19:59,430 --> 01:20:00,850
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Did you guys copy that?</i></font>

1210
01:20:00,890 --> 01:20:01,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">We did.</font>

1211
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:04,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got a private jet
taking off across town.</font>

1212
01:20:04,890 --> 01:20:06,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">No manifest.</font>

1213
01:20:06,479 --> 01:20:07,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">That could be him.</font>

1214
01:20:08,270 --> 01:20:09,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">There. It's a truck
from the lab.</font>

1215
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:11,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right above you, Cap.</font>

1216
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:13,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">On the loop by the bridge.</font>

1217
01:20:13,899 --> 01:20:14,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's them.</font>

1218
01:20:15,029 --> 01:20:16,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got three with the
Cradle, one in the cab.</font>

1219
01:20:17,609 --> 01:20:18,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could take out the driver.</font>

1220
01:20:18,819 --> 01:20:20,029
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Negative. That truck crashes,</i></font>

1221
01:20:20,069 --> 01:20:21,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">the gem could level the city.</font>

1222
01:20:21,949 --> 01:20:24,539
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>We need to draw out Ultron.</i></font>

1223
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:35,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no, no.</font>

1224
01:20:36,710 --> 01:20:37,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leave me alone!</font>

1225
01:20:46,470 --> 01:20:48,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, he's definitely unhappy.</font>

1226
01:20:48,310 --> 01:20:49,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna try and
keep him that way.</font>

1227
01:20:49,979 --> 01:20:51,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not a match for him, Cap.</font>

1228
01:20:52,439 --> 01:20:53,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks, Barton.</font>

1229
01:21:16,090 --> 01:21:17,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what's in that cradle?</font>

1230
01:21:18,670 --> 01:21:20,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">The power to make real change.</font>

1231
01:21:20,550 --> 01:21:22,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that terrifies you.</font>

1232
01:21:22,090 --> 01:21:23,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wouldn't call it a comfort.</font>

1233
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:27,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop it.</font>

1234
01:21:38,319 --> 01:21:41,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got a window. Four, three...</font>

1235
01:21:41,699 --> 01:21:42,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give him hell.</font>

1236
01:21:53,619 --> 01:21:55,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm always picking
up after you boys.</font>

1237
01:21:56,710 --> 01:21:58,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're heading under the overpass.
I've got no shot.</font>

1238
01:21:58,750 --> 01:21:59,800
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Which way?</i></font>

1239
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:01,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hard right.</font>

1240
01:22:02,090 --> 01:22:03,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now.</font>

1241
01:22:34,079 --> 01:22:36,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Out of the way! Coming through!
Sorry, coming through!</font>

1242
01:22:52,180 --> 01:22:53,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on!</font>

1243
01:22:54,310 --> 01:22:56,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Clint, can you draw out the guards?
- Let's find out.</font>

1244
01:22:57,439 --> 01:22:58,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">Beep, beep!</font>

1245
01:23:35,770 --> 01:23:37,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're heading
back towards you.</font>

1246
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:39,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">So whatever you're
gonna do, do it now.</font>

1247
01:23:44,649 --> 01:23:47,319
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I'm going in. Cap, can
you keep him occupied?</i></font>

1248
01:23:48,109 --> 01:23:49,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you think
I've been doing?</font>

1249
01:24:32,869 --> 01:24:35,159
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Okay, package is airborne.</i></font>

1250
01:24:35,789 --> 01:24:36,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a clean shot.</font>

1251
01:24:37,329 --> 01:24:38,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Negative. I am still
in the truck.</font>

1252
01:24:38,789 --> 01:24:39,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What the hell are you...
- Just be ready.</font>

1253
01:24:39,869 --> 01:24:41,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sending the package to you.</font>

1254
01:24:41,710 --> 01:24:42,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you want me to take it?</font>

1255
01:24:43,789 --> 01:24:45,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">You might wish you
hadn't asked that.</font>

1256
01:24:57,930 --> 01:24:59,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, don't do this.</font>

1257
01:25:00,270 --> 01:25:01,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">What choice do we have?</font>

1258
01:25:10,149 --> 01:25:11,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">I lost him!</font>

1259
01:25:11,239 --> 01:25:12,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's headed your way!</font>

1260
01:25:17,659 --> 01:25:18,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nat, we gotta go.</font>

1261
01:25:30,930 --> 01:25:32,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nat!</font>

1262
01:25:35,850 --> 01:25:36,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cap, you see Nat?</font>

1263
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:40,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you have the package,
get it to Stark! Go!</font>

1264
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:41,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you have eyes on Nat?</font>

1265
01:25:41,939 --> 01:25:43,020
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Go!</i></font>

1266
01:25:44,939 --> 01:25:46,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn it.</font>

1267
01:25:46,479 --> 01:25:47,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">Civilians in our path.</font>

1268
01:25:48,859 --> 01:25:49,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you stop this thing?</font>

1269
01:26:29,229 --> 01:26:30,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm fine.</font>

1270
01:26:30,689 --> 01:26:32,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just need to take a minute.</font>

1271
01:26:32,859 --> 01:26:34,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm very tempted not
to give you one.</font>

1272
01:26:34,859 --> 01:26:36,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Cradle. Did you get it?</font>

1273
01:26:36,909 --> 01:26:38,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stark will take care of it.</font>

1274
01:26:39,829 --> 01:26:40,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, he won't.</font>

1275
01:26:44,250 --> 01:26:46,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't know what you're talking about.
Stark's not crazy.</font>

1276
01:26:46,670 --> 01:26:48,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">He will do anything
to make things right.</font>

1277
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:55,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stark, come in.</font>

1278
01:26:55,470 --> 01:26:56,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stark.</font>

1279
01:26:57,850 --> 01:26:59,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyone on comms.</font>

1280
01:26:59,140 --> 01:27:00,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ultron can't tell the difference</font>

1281
01:27:00,680 --> 01:27:03,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">between saving the world
and destroying it.</font>

1282
01:27:04,939 --> 01:27:07,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where do you think he gets that?</font>

1283
01:27:09,609 --> 01:27:11,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Anything on Nat?
- I haven't heard.</font>

1284
01:27:11,279 --> 01:27:13,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">But she's alive, or Ultron would
be rubbing our faces in it.</font>

1285
01:27:13,779 --> 01:27:15,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is sealed tight.</font>

1286
01:27:15,199 --> 01:27:16,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna need to
access the program,</font>

1287
01:27:16,779 --> 01:27:18,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">break it down from within.</font>

1288
01:27:19,949 --> 01:27:22,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any chance Natasha might leave you
a message outside the Internet?</font>

1289
01:27:22,869 --> 01:27:23,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Old-school spy stuff?</font>

1290
01:27:24,289 --> 01:27:26,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are some nets I can cast.</font>

1291
01:27:26,250 --> 01:27:27,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I'll find her.</font>

1292
01:27:30,090 --> 01:27:31,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can work on
tissue degeneration</font>

1293
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:35,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you could fry whatever
operational system Cho implanted.</font>

1294
01:27:35,300 --> 01:27:36,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, about that.</font>

1295
01:27:40,810 --> 01:27:41,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

1296
01:27:42,010 --> 01:27:43,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You have to trust me.
- Kind of don't.</font>

1297

<font color="#FFFFFF">Our ally, the guy protecting
the military's nuclear codes,</font>

1298
01:27:50,020 --> 01:27:51,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">I found him.</font>

1299
01:27:51,149 --> 01:27:52,270
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Hello, Dr. Banner.</i></font>

1300
01:27:53,149 --> 01:27:55,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ultron didn't go after
Jarvis because he was angry.</font>

1301
01:27:55,989 --> 01:27:59,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">He attacked him because he was
scared of what he can do.</font>

1302
01:28:00,739 --> 01:28:02,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">So Jarvis went underground.</font>

1303
01:28:02,489 --> 01:28:04,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Scattered, dumped his memory.</font>

1304
01:28:04,579 --> 01:28:06,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">But not his protocols.</font>

1305
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:10,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">He didn't even know he was in there
until I pieced him together.</font>

1306
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:17,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, you want me to help you
put Jarvis into this thing?</font>

1307
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:19,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! Of course not.</font>

1308
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:21,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanna help you put
Jarvis in this thing.</font>

1309
01:28:23,680 --> 01:28:25,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're out of my field, here.</font>

1310
01:28:25,470 --> 01:28:27,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know bio-organics
better than anyone.</font>

1311
01:28:27,689 --> 01:28:30,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you just assume that
Jarvis's operational matrix</font>

1312
01:28:30,810 --> 01:28:32,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">can beat Ultron's?</font>

1313
01:28:32,359 --> 01:28:35,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jarvis has been beating him
from inside without knowing it.</font>

1314
01:28:35,779 --> 01:28:36,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the opportunity.</font>

1315
01:28:36,859 --> 01:28:38,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can create
Ultron's perfect self</font>

1316
01:28:38,779 --> 01:28:42,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">without the homicidal glitches he
thinks are his winning personality.</font>

1317
01:28:42,369 --> 01:28:43,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to.</font>

1318
01:28:43,489 --> 01:28:44,539
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I believe it's worth a go.</i></font>

1319
01:28:47,039 --> 01:28:48,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm in a loop!</font>

1320
01:28:48,250 --> 01:28:49,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm caught in a time loop.</font>

1321
01:28:49,369 --> 01:28:51,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is exactly where
it all went wrong.</font>

1322
01:28:51,380 --> 01:28:53,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know. I know. I know
what everyone's gonna say.</font>

1323
01:28:53,380 --> 01:28:55,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">But they're already saying it.</font>

1324
01:28:55,880 --> 01:28:57,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're mad scientists.</font>

1325
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:00,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're monsters, buddy.
We've gotta own it.</font>

1326
01:29:01,550 --> 01:29:02,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make a stand.</font>

1327
01:29:08,140 --> 01:29:09,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not a loop.</font>

1328
01:29:10,899 --> 01:29:12,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the end of the line.</font>

1329
01:29:33,170 --> 01:29:35,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wasn't sure you would wake up.</font>

1330
01:29:35,420 --> 01:29:38,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hoped you would. I
wanted to show you.</font>

1331
01:29:39,050 --> 01:29:40,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't have anyone else.</font>

1332
01:29:43,510 --> 01:29:47,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think a lot about meteors.
The purity in them.</font>

1333
01:29:47,260 --> 01:29:48,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boom! The end.</font>

1334
01:29:49,270 --> 01:29:50,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Start again.</font>

1335
01:29:50,850 --> 01:29:52,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">The world made clean</font>

1336
01:29:52,939 --> 01:29:55,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">for the new man to rebuild.</font>

1337
01:29:55,609 --> 01:29:57,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was meant to be new.</font>

1338
01:29:58,609 --> 01:30:01,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was meant to be beautiful.</font>

1339
01:30:01,779 --> 01:30:03,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">The world would have
looked to the sky</font>

1340
01:30:03,949 --> 01:30:05,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">and seen hope,</font>

1341
01:30:05,619 --> 01:30:06,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">seen mercy.</font>

1342
01:30:07,699 --> 01:30:09,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Instead, they'll
look up in horror</font>

1343
01:30:09,909 --> 01:30:11,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">because of you.</font>

1344
01:30:11,460 --> 01:30:13,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've wounded me.</font>

1345
01:30:13,869 --> 01:30:15,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">I give you full marks for that.</font>

1346
01:30:16,210 --> 01:30:19,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, like the man said,
what doesn't kill me...</font>

1347
01:30:24,300 --> 01:30:25,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">just makes me stronger.</font>

1348
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:08,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">This framework is

1378
01:34:07,229 --> 01:34:08,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the Mind Stone.</font>

Infinity Stones.</font>

1392
01:34:35,550 --> 01:34:37,220

1395
01:34:45,399 --> 01:34:46,560

the Mind Stone.</font>

- Is it?</font>

1403
01:35:02,289 --> 01:35:03,539

1404
01:35:04,329 --> 01:35:05,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">On our side?</font>

1405
01:35:07,630 --> 01:35:09,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think it's that simple.</font>

1406
01:35:09,670 --> 01:35:12,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it better get
real simple real soon.</font>

1407
01:35:13,300 --> 01:35:15,470

1410
01:35:19,180 --> 01:35:21,180

1411
01:35:21,270 --> 01:35:22,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You.
- Where?</font>

1412
01:35:22,680 --> 01:35:23,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sokovia.</font>

1413
01:35:24,020 --> 01:35:25,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's got Nat there, too.</font>

1414
01:35:27,189 --> 01:35:28,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we're wrong about you,</font>

1415

Ultron made you to be...</font>

1417
01:35:42,199 --> 01:35:44,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to kill Ultron.</font>

1418
01:35:44,659 --> 01:35:48,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's unique and he's in pain.</font>

1419
01:35:49,590 --> 01:35:52,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">But that pain will
roll over the Earth.</font>

1420
01:35:52,510 --> 01:35:55,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, he must be destroyed.</font>

1421
01:35:55,220 --> 01:35:58,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every form he's built, every trace
of his presence on the net.</font>

1422
01:35:58,390 --> 01:36:00,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to act now.</font>

1423
01:36:00,430 --> 01:36:04,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">And not one of us can do
it without the others.</font>

1424
01:36:06,439 --> 01:36:08,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe I am a monster.</font>

1425
01:36:08,479 --> 01:36:10,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think I'd
know if I were one.</font>

1426
01:36:11,939 --> 01:36:13,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not what you are,</font>

1427
01:36:14,149 --> 01:36:16,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">and not what you intended.</font>

1428
01:36:17,069 --> 01:36:19,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, there may be no way
to make you trust me.</font>

1429
01:36:19,819 --> 01:36:21,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we need to go.</font>

1430
01:36:36,050 --> 01:36:37,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right.</font>

1431
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:39,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well done.</font>

1432
01:36:40,850 --> 01:36:41,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three minutes.</font>

1433
01:36:42,640 --> 01:36:44,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get what you need.</font>

1434
01:37:00,199 --> 01:37:01,199
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Good evening, boss.</i></font>

1435

1437
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:12,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's gonna be
blood on the floor.</font>

1438
01:37:12,380 --> 01:37:13,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got no plans tomorrow night.</font>

1439
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:15,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">I get first crack
at the big guy.</font>

1440
01:37:15,630 --> 01:37:17,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Iron Man's the one
he's waiting for.</font>

1441
01:37:17,260 --> 01:37:19,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's true. He
hates you the most.</font>

1442
01:37:25,010 --> 01:37:27,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ultron knows we're coming.</font>

1443
01:37:27,390 --> 01:37:29,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Odds are we'll be
riding into heavy fire.</font>

1444
01:37:30,100 --> 01:37:31,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's what
we signed up for.</font>

1445
01:37:32,060 --> 01:37:34,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the people of
Sokovia, they didn't.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>So our priority</i></font>

Now!</font>

1449
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:51,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get off your asses.</font>

1450
01:37:52,710 --> 01:37:54,630
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>All they want is to live
their lives in peace.</i></font>

1451
01:37:55,210 --> 01:37:56,529

happen today.</i></font>

1452
01:37:58,170 --> 01:37:59,920
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>But we can do our
best to protect them.</i></font>

1453
01:38:00,590 --> 01:38:02,220
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And we can get the job done.</i></font>

1454
01:38:05,510 --> 01:38:07,810
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>We find out what
Ultron's been building,</i></font>

1455
01:38:08,770 --> 01:38:10,430
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>we find Romanoff,</i></font>

1456
01:38:10,890 --> 01:38:12,770

<font color="#FFFFFF">Ultron thinks we're monsters.</font>

1459
01:38:25,699 --> 01:38:28,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">That we're what's
wrong with the world.</font>

1460
01:38:28,289 --> 01:38:30,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">This isn't just
about beating him.</font>

1461
01:38:31,079 --> 01:38:33,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's about whether he's right.</font>

1462
01:38:39,590 --> 01:38:40,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Natasha!</font>

1463
01:38:41,800 --> 01:38:42,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Natasha!</font>

1464
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:44,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bruce?</font>

1465
01:38:45,340 --> 01:38:46,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">You all right?</font>

1466
01:38:46,470 --> 01:38:47,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

1467
01:38:47,810 --> 01:38:49,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">The team is in the city.
It's about to light up.</font>

1468
01:38:49,640 --> 01:38:51,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't suppose you found a
key lying around somewhere.</font>

1469
01:38:52,060 --> 01:38:54,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. I did.</font>

1470
01:39:00,609 --> 01:39:01,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what's our play?</font>

1471
01:39:01,939 --> 01:39:03,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm here to get you to safety.</font>

1472
01:39:03,989 --> 01:39:04,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Job's not finished.</font>

1473
01:39:05,159 --> 01:39:08,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">We could help with the evacuation, but
I can't be in a fight near civilians.</font>

1474
01:39:09,909 --> 01:39:11,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you've done plenty.</font>

1475
01:39:13,500 --> 01:39:15,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our fight is over.</font>

1476
01:39:16,380 --> 01:39:19,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, we just disappear?</font>

1477
01:39:23,380 --> 01:39:24,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

1478
01:39:29,390 --> 01:39:31,720
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Your man's in the church, boss.</i></font>

1480
01:39:37,689 --> 01:39:39,729

1481
01:39:39,859 --> 01:39:41,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know. How
much time you got?</font>

1482
01:39:41,229 --> 01:39:42,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">More than you.</font>

1483
01:39:45,109 --> 01:39:47,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you been juicing?
Little vibranium cocktail?</font>

1484
01:39:48,029 --> 01:39:50,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're looking... I don't
wanna say "puffy."</font>

1485
01:39:50,529 --> 01:39:52,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're stalling to
protect the people.</font>

1486
01:39:52,579 --> 01:39:55,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that is the mission.
Did you forget?</font>

1487
01:39:55,710 --> 01:39:58,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've moved beyond your mission.
I'm free.</font>

1488
01:40:03,010 --> 01:40:04,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

1489
01:40:04,920 --> 01:40:07,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think you were the
only one stalling?</font>

1490
01:40:08,050 --> 01:40:09,680
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>There's the rest
of the vibranium.</i></font>

1491
01:40:09,720 --> 01:40:11,220
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Function, still unclear.</i></font>

1492
01:40:11,350 --> 01:40:13,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is how you end, Tony.</font>

1493
01:40:13,770 --> 01:40:15,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is peace in my time.</font>

1494
01:40:32,239 --> 01:40:33,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go!</font>

1495
01:40:38,789 --> 01:40:40,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get off the bridge!</font>

1496
01:40:44,420 --> 01:40:45,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Run!</font>

02:08:26,500 --> 02:08:29,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">No matter who wins or loses,
trouble still comes around.</font>

1796
02:08:33,760 --> 02:08:35,010
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>The rules have changed.</i></font>

1797
02:08:35,130 --> 02:08:36,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're dealing with
something new.</font>

1798
02:08:36,840 --> 02:08:38,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Vision is artificial
intelligence.</font>

1799
02:08:38,300 --> 02:08:40,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">- A machine.
- So, it doesn't count?</font>

1800
02:08:40,390 --> 02:08:42,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it's not like a person
lifting the hammer.</font>

1801
02:08:42,479 --> 02:08:44,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right, different rules for us.</font>

1802
02:08:44,270 --> 02:08:45,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Nice guy. Artificial.
- Thank you.</font>

1803
02:08:45,439 --> 02:08:48,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">He can wield the hammer, he
can keep the Mind Stone.</font>

1804
02:08:49,399 --> 02:08:51,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's safe with the Vision.</font>

1805
02:08:51,729 --> 02:08:54,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">And these days, safe
is in short supply.</font>

1806
02:08:56,279 --> 02:08:58,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if you put the
hammer in an elevator...</font>

1807
02:08:58,409 --> 02:09:00,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It would still go up.
- Elevator's not worthy.</font>

1808
02:09:00,279 --> 02:09:02,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna miss these
little talks of ours.</font>

1809
02:09:02,239 --> 02:09:03,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not if you don't leave.</font>

1810
02:09:03,949 --> 02:09:05,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have no choice.</font>

1811
02:09:05,960 --> 02:09:08,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Mind Stone is the fourth
of the Infinity Stones</font>

1812
02:09:08,289 --> 02:09:09,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">to show up in the
last few years.</font>

1813
02:09:09,789 --> 02:09:11,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not a coincidence.</font>

1814
02:09:12,170 --> 02:09:14,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone has been playing
an intricate game</font>

1815
02:09:14,090 --> 02:09:15,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">and has made pawns of us.</font>

1816
02:09:15,840 --> 02:09:17,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">And once all these pieces
are in position...</font>

1817
02:09:17,840 --> 02:09:19,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Triple Yahtzee.</font>

1818
02:09:19,470 --> 02:09:20,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think you can find
out what's coming?</font>

1819
02:09:21,060 --> 02:09:22,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do.</font>

1820
02:09:22,890 --> 02:09:24,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">Besides this one,</font>

1821
02:09:24,560 --> 02:09:26,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">there's nothing that
can't be explained.</font>

1822
02:09:34,239 --> 02:09:36,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">That man has no regard
for lawn maintenance.</font>

1823
02:09:39,909 --> 02:09:42,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna miss him, though.
And you're gonna miss me.</font>

1824
02:09:42,659 --> 02:09:44,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's gonna be a
lot of manful tears.</font>

1825
02:09:46,409 --> 02:09:48,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will miss you, Tony.</font>

1826
02:09:48,329 --> 02:09:49,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah?</font>

1827
02:09:49,460 --> 02:09:52,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it's time for
me to tap out.</font>

1828
02:09:52,130 --> 02:09:54,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe I should take a page
out of Barton's book.</font>

1829
02:09:54,460 --> 02:09:57,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Build Pepper a farm,
hope nobody blows it up.</font>

1830
02:09:58,090 --> 02:09:59,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">The simple life.</font>

1831
02:09:59,510 --> 02:10:00,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll get there one day.</font>

1832
02:10:00,890 --> 02:10:01,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

1833
02:10:02,140 --> 02:10:04,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Family, stability...</font>

1834
02:10:05,680 --> 02:10:08,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">The guy who wanted all that
went in the ice 75 years ago.</font>

1835
02:10:10,310 --> 02:10:12,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think someone else came out.</font>

1836
02:10:16,239 --> 02:10:17,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">You all right?</font>

1837
02:10:19,909 --> 02:10:21,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm home.</font>

1838
02:10:29,250 --> 02:10:32,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanna keep staring at the
wall, or do you wanna go to work?</font>

1839
02:10:32,210 --> 02:10:33,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, it's a pretty
interesting wall.</font>

1840
02:10:33,670 --> 02:10:36,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you and Tony were still
gazing into each other's eyes.</font>

1841
02:10:36,840 --> 02:10:37,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do we look?</font>

1842
02:10:38,050 --> 02:10:40,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we're not the '27 Yankees.</font>

1843
02:10:40,470 --> 02:10:42,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got some hitters.</font>

1844
02:10:42,340 --> 02:10:44,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're good.
They're not a team.</font>

1845
02:10:44,890 --> 02:10:46,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's beat them into shape.</font>

1846
02:11:04,989 --> 02:11:06,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Avengers...</font>

1847
02:13:25,380 --> 02:13:26,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine.</font>

1848
02:13:26,909 --> 02:13:44,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">♪ <i>Hope it helped -> bozxphd</i> ♪</font>
