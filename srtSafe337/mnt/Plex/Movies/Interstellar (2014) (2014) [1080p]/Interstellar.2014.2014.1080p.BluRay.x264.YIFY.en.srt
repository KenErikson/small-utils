This one needs to wait.</font>

129
00:09:45,529 --> 00:09:46,570

- Yeah, we had a flat.</font>

135

00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:52,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's your waistline?
About what, 32?</font>

150
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:54,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">About a 33 inseam?</font>

151
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:55,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not sure I see
what you're getting at.</font>

152
00:10:55,929 --> 00:10:58,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're telling me it takes two numbers
to measure your own ass</font>

153
00:10:58,529 --> 00:11:00,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">but only one
to measure my son's future?</font>

154
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

155
00:11:02,769 --> 00:11:04,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a
well-educated man, Coop.</font>

156
00:11:04,669 --> 00:11:06,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And a trained pilot.
- And an engineer.</font>

157
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:09,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, well, right now</font>

158
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:11,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">we don't need more engineers.</font>

159
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:15,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">We didn't run out
of television screens and planes.</font>

160
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">We ran out of food.</font>

161
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:20,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">The world needs farmers.
Good farmers, like you.</font>

162
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:22,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And Tom.
- Uneducated farmers.</font>

163
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:26,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're a caretaker generation, Coop.</font>

164
00:11:26,299 --> 00:11:27,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">And things are getting better.</font>

165
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:31,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Maybe your grandkids will get to be engin...
- Are we done here, sir?</font>

166
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

167
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:36,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Miss Hanley's here
to talk about Murph.</font>

168
00:11:36,769 --> 00:11:39,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Murph is a great kid.
She's really bright.</font>

169
00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:41,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">But she's been having
a little trouble lately.</font>

170
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">She brought this in
to show the students.</font>

171
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:47,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The section on the lunar landings.
- Yeah, it's one of my old textbooks.</font>

172
00:11:48,419 --> 00:11:51,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">- She always loved the pictures.
- It's an old federal textbook.</font>

173
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:54,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've replaced them
with the corrected versions.</font>

174
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:55,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Corrected?</font>

175
00:11:55,769 --> 00:11:57,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Explaining how
the Apollo missions were faked...</font>

176
00:11:57,929 --> 00:12:00,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">to bankrupt the Soviet Union.</font>

177
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:08,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't believe
we went to the moon?</font>

178
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:11,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe it was
a brilliant piece of propaganda.</font>

179
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:13,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">That the Soviets
bankrupted themselves...</font>

180
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:17,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">pouring resources into rockets
and other useless machines.</font>

181
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:18,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Useless machines."</font>

182
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if we don't want
to repeat of the excess...</font>

183
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">and wastefulness of the 20th century,</font>

184
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">then we need to teach
our kids about this planet,</font>

185
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:26,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">not tales of leaving it.</font>

186
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, one of those useless machines
they used to make...</font>

187
00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:31,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">was called an MRI.</font>

188
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:33,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we had any of those left,</font>

189
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:35,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">the doctors
would've been able to find...</font>

190
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">the cyst in my wife's brain</font>

191
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:39,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">before she died
instead of afterwards.</font>

192
00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:42,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then she'd have been the one
listening to this instead of me...</font>

193
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">which would have been a good thing,
because she was always...</font>

194
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">the calmer one.</font>

195
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry
about your wife, Mr. Cooper.</font>

196
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">But Murph got into a fistfight
with several of her classmates...</font>

197
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:57,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">over this Apollo nonsense.</font>

198
00:12:57,539 --> 00:12:58,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we thought it'd be best
to bring you in</font>

199
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">and see what ideas
you might have...</font>

200
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">for dealing with her behavior
on the home front.</font>

201
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, you know what?
Um, there's a game tomorrow night.</font>

202
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's going through
a bit of a baseball phase.</font>

203
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:13,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her favorite team is playing.
There's gonna be candy and soda and...</font>

204
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I'll take her to that.</font>

205
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:25,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">How'd it go?</font>

206
00:13:26,169 --> 00:13:28,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got you suspended.</font>

207
00:13:28,129 --> 00:13:30,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- Cooper.</font>

208
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is Cooper. Go.</font>

209
00:13:32,629 --> 00:13:35,649
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Coop, those combines you rebuilt,
went haywire.</i></font>

210
00:13:35,669 --> 00:13:37,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just reset the controllers.</font>

211
00:13:38,129 --> 00:13:40,870
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I did that. Now,
you should come take a look.</i></font>

212
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:03,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">One by one they've been
peeling off the fields and heading over.</font>

213
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something's interfering
with the compass.</font>

214
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:09,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">Magnetism or some such.</font>

215
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing special about which book.</font>

216
00:14:54,669 --> 00:14:57,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been working on it,
like you said.</font>

217
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I counted the spaces.
- Why?</font>

218
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">In case the ghost
is trying to communicate.</font>

219
00:15:05,169 --> 00:15:06,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm trying Morse.</font>

220
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Morse?
- Yeah.</font>

221
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:13,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Dots and dashes, used...
- I know what Morse code is, Murph.</font>

222
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just don't think
your bookshelf's trying to talk to you.</font>

223
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Had to reset
every compass clock and GPS...</font>

224
00:15:30,269 --> 00:15:32,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">to offset for the anomaly.</font>

225
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Which is?
- I don't know.</font>

226
00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:38,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">If the house
was built on magnetic ore...</font>

227
00:15:38,929 --> 00:15:42,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">we'd have seen this the first time
we switched on the tractor.</font>

228
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:47,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hear your meeting at the school
didn't go so well.</font>

229
00:15:49,529 --> 00:15:50,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">You heard?</font>

230
00:15:51,169 --> 00:15:53,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like we've forgotten
who we are, Donald.</font>

231
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:59,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Explorers, pioneers,
not caretakers.</font>

232
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I was a kid...</font>

233
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:05,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">it felt like they made
something new every day.</font>

234
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:09,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some gadget or idea.</font>

235
00:16:09,029 --> 00:16:10,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like every day was Christmas.</font>

236
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:15,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">But six billion people
just try to imagine that.</font>

237
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">And every last one of them
trying to have it all.</font>

238
00:16:23,299 --> 00:16:25,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">This world isn't so bad.</font>

239
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:31,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Tom will do just fine.
You're the one who doesn't belong.</font>

240
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:34,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Born 40 years too late,
or 40 years too early.</font>

241
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:37,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">My daughter knew it,
God bless her.</font>

242
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:41,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">And your kids know it.
Especially Murph.</font>

243
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:45,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we used to look up in the sky
and wonder...</font>

244
00:16:45,429 --> 00:16:47,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">at our place in the stars.</font>

245
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:52,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now we just look down...</font>

246
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">and worry
about our place in the dirt.</font>

247
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cooper,
you were good at something...</font>

248
00:16:58,269 --> 00:17:00,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you never got a chance
to do anything with it.</font>

249
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:03,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

250
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:06,569
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>You didn't expect this dirt...</i></font>

251
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:09,069
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>that was giving you this food...</i></font>

252
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:12,269
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>to turn on you like that
and destroy you.</i></font>

253
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:17,029
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>In April, I believe I'm right,
15th of April, I think.</i></font>

254
00:17:17,049 --> 00:17:19,750
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>This happened about 1:30
when that thing...</i></font>

255
00:17:19,769 --> 00:17:23,039
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>came off the top
of that canyon.</i></font>

256
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:25,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">In my day,
we had real ballplayers.</font>

257
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are these bums?</font>

258
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:29,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, in my day,
people were too busy...</font>

259
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:32,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">fighting over food
to even play baseball.</font>

260
00:17:32,769 --> 00:17:35,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Popcorn at a ballgame
is unnatural.</font>

261
00:17:36,099 --> 00:17:37,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want a hot dog.</font>

262
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:39,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">School says you're gonna follow
in my footsteps.</font>

263
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think that's great.</font>

264
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:45,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You think that's great?
- You hate farming, Dad.</font>

265
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grandpa said.</font>

266
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:49,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grandpa said?</font>

267
00:17:50,299 --> 00:17:52,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, all that matters
is how you feel about it.</font>

268
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like what you do.</font>

269
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:56,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like our farm.</font>

270
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:59,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're gonna be great at it.</font>

271
00:18:12,099 --> 00:18:13,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's get out of here.</font>

272
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:22,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, it's a doozy.</font>

273
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:25,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, gang,
let's mask up.</font>

274
00:18:28,529 --> 00:18:30,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Tom? Murph? Check?
- Yeah.</font>

275
00:19:24,069 --> 00:19:26,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">Murph, Tom,
you guys shut your windows?</font>

276
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:32,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Murph!</font>

277

<font color="#FFFFFF">The ghost.</font>

278
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grab your pillow.</font>

279
00:19:58,269 --> 00:20:00,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're sleeping in with Tom.</font>

280

<font color="#FFFFFF">Dad?</font>

281
00:20:55,069 --> 00:20:56,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not a ghost.</font>

282
00:21:02,099 --> 00:21:03,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's gravity.</font>

283
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:07,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm dropping Tom,
then heading to town.</font>

284
00:21:08,069 --> 00:21:10,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to clean that up...</font>

285
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">when you've finished praying to it?</font>

286
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not Morse, Murph.
It's binary.</font>

287
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:43,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thick is one, thin is zero.</font>

288

<font color="#FFFFFF">Nope.</font>

290

00:21:57,569 --> 00:21:59,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thirty-three.</font>

292
00:22:01,829 --> 00:22:03,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's it.</font>

293
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't miss this!</font>

294
00:22:06,029 --> 00:22:09,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grandpa will be back
in a couple hours, Murph.</font>

295
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you don't know
what you're gonna find.</font>

296
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:18,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that is why
I can't take you.</font>

297
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:25,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Murph?</font>

298
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:31,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grandpa will be home in a while.
Tell him I'll call him on the radio.</font>

299
00:22:37,019 --> 00:22:38,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Aah!
- Jesus!</font>

300
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

301
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think
this is funny?</font>

302
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for me.</font>

303
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:50,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make yourself useful.</font>

304
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Murph?</font>

305
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Murphy.</font>

306
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:03,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think this is the end of the road.</font>

307
00:24:06,329 --> 00:24:08,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">Didn't you bring the bolt cutters?</font>

308
00:24:09,569 --> 00:24:10,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's my girl.</font>

309
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:39,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Step away from the fence!
- No, no, no.</font>

310
00:24:40,029 --> 00:24:41,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't shoot!
Don't shoot! I'm not armed.</font>

311
00:24:42,029 --> 00:24:44,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">My daughter's in the car.</font>

312
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't be afraid.</font>

313
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:05,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did you find this place?</font>

314
00:25:06,529 --> 00:25:08,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's my daughter?</font>

315
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:09,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">You had the coordinates
for this facility...</font>

316
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:12,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">marked on your map.
Where did you get those coordinates?</font>

317
00:25:12,029 --> 00:25:13,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's my daughter!</font>

318
00:25:13,369 --> 00:25:16,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't make me
take you down again. Sit down!</font>

319
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">You still think
you're a Marine, pal?</font>

320
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:21,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">Marines don't exist anymore.</font>

321
00:25:22,069 --> 00:25:25,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I got grunts
like you mowing my grass.</font>

322
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where did you find
those coordinates?</font>

323
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you don't look
much like a lawnmower.</font>

324
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Think I'll turn you
into an overqualified vacuum cleaner.</font>

325
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:34,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you won't.</font>

326
00:25:35,829 --> 00:25:37,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">back down, please.</font>

327
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:42,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, you're taking a risk
using ex-military security.</font>

328
00:25:42,829 --> 00:25:46,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're old, and their control units
are unpredictable.</font>

329
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:48,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's what
the government could spare.</font>

330
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:53,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who are you?
- Dr. Brand.</font>

331
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:56,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I knew a Dr. Brand once.
He was a professor.</font>

332
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:57,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">What makes you think I'm not?</font>

333
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:00,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wasn't near as cute, either.</font>

334
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:03,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, Dr. Brand.
I don't have any idea what this is.</font>

335
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:07,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now I'm scared for my daughter
and want her by my side.</font>

336
00:26:07,029 --> 00:26:10,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">You give me that,
I'll tell you anything you want to know.</font>

337
00:26:13,069 --> 00:26:15,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get the principals and the girl
in the conference room, please.</font>

338
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:20,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your daughter is fine. Bright kid.</font>

339
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:22,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Must have a very smart mother.</font>

340
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:25,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's pretty clear
you don't want any visitors.</font>

341
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:27,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">So why don't you just
let us back up from your fence...</font>

342
00:26:27,349 --> 00:26:29,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we'll be on our way?</font>

343
00:26:29,529 --> 00:26:32,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's not that simple.
- Well, sure, it is.</font>

344
00:26:32,329 --> 00:26:33,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know anything about you.</font>

345
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:36,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know anything
about this place.</font>

346
00:26:36,869 --> 00:26:38,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, you do.</font>

347
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:45,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dad!</font>

348
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Cooper.</font>

349
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:51,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Brand.</font>

350
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:55,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Explain to me
how you found this facility.</font>

351
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:57,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kind of an accident.
We sort of stumbled upon it.</font>

352
00:26:57,549 --> 00:26:58,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were on a salvage run...</font>

353
00:26:58,769 --> 00:27:01,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're sitting
in the best-kept secret in the world.</font>

354
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:05,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody stumbles in here.
Nobody stumbles out.</font>

355
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cooper, please.</font>

356
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:09,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cooperate with these people.</font>

357
00:27:09,829 --> 00:27:11,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look.</font>

358
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's kind of hard to explain.</font>

359
00:27:14,069 --> 00:27:17,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">We learned these coordinates...</font>

360
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:20,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">- from an anomaly.
- What sort of anomaly?</font>

361
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hesitate to term it supernatural,
but it definitely wasn't scientific.</font>

362
00:27:23,829 --> 00:27:27,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're gonna have to be specific,
Mr. Cooper, right now.</font>

363
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was gravity.</font>

364
00:27:34,369 --> 00:27:37,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">What sort of gravitational anomaly?
Where was this?</font>

365
00:27:37,369 --> 00:27:41,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, I'm real happy that
you're excited about gravity, bud...</font>

366
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:43,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you're not getting
any answers from us until I get assurances.</font>

367
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:45,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Assurances?
- Yeah.</font>

368
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like, that we're
getting out of here.</font>

369
00:27:48,269 --> 00:27:49,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I don't mean
in the trunk of some car.</font>

370
00:27:52,299 --> 00:27:54,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you know
who we are, Coop?</font>

371
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:55,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, professor, I don't.</font>

372
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:58,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know
my father, Professor Brand.</font>

373
00:27:58,630 --> 00:27:59,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're NASA.</font>

374
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:03,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">- NASA?</font>

375
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:06,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">The same NASA you flew for.</font>

376
00:28:17,099 --> 00:28:18,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard
they shut you down, sir...</font>

377
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">for refusing to drop bombs
from the stratosphere...</font>

378
00:28:21,369 --> 00:28:23,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">onto starving people.</font>

379
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:25,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">But when they realized
that killing other people was...</font>

380
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:28,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">not a long-term solution,
then they needed us back.</font>

381
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:30,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">- In secret.
- Why secret?</font>

382
00:28:30,829 --> 00:28:32,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because public opinion...</font>

383
00:28:32,049 --> 00:28:34,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">wouldn't allow
spending on space exploration.</font>

384
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:37,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not while you're struggling
to put food on the table.</font>

385
00:28:38,769 --> 00:28:39,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blight.</font>

386
00:28:40,369 --> 00:28:42,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wheat; seven years ago.</font>

387
00:28:42,869 --> 00:28:44,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okra; this year.</font>

388
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:46,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now there's just corn.</font>

389
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:49,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we're growing
more than we ever have.</font>

390
00:28:49,049 --> 00:28:51,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">But like the potatoes in Ireland...</font>

391
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the wheat in the Dust Bowl...</font>

392
00:28:53,869 --> 00:28:56,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">the corn will die.</font>

393
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:58,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Soon.</font>

394
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:07,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll find a way, professor.
We always have.</font>

395
00:29:08,069 --> 00:29:11,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Driven by the unshakable faith
the Earth is ours.</font>

396
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:14,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not just ours, no.</font>

397
00:29:15,099 --> 00:29:16,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it is our home.</font>

398
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:21,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Earth's atmosphere
is 80 percent nitrogen.</font>

399
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:23,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't even breathe nitrogen.</font>

400
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:28,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blight does. And as it thrives,
our air gets less and less oxygen.</font>

401
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:32,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">The last people to starve
will be the first to suffocate.</font>

402
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">And your daughter's generation...</font>

403
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:38,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">will be the last to survive on Earth.</font>

404
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:40,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Murph is feeling a little tired.</font>

405
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:42,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was wondering
if she could take a nap in my office.</font>

406
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:44,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Thank you.</font>

407
00:29:46,829 --> 00:29:48,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

408
00:29:48,869 --> 00:29:52,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now you need to tell me
what your plan is to save the world.</font>

409
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not meant to save the world.</font>

410
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:57,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're meant to leave it.</font>

411
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rangers.</font>

412
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:04,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">The last components...</font>

413
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:08,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">of our one versatile ship
in orbit, the Endurance.</font>

414
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:10,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our final expedition.</font>

415
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:14,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">You sent people out there
looking for a new home?</font>

416
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Lazarus missions.</font>

417
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:19,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That sounds cheerful.
- Lazarus came back from the dead.</font>

418
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure, but he had to die
in the first place.</font>

419
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:25,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's not a planet
in our solar system that could sustain life...</font>

420
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:28,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the nearest star's
over a thousand years away.</font>

421
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:31,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that doesn't even qualify as futile.</font>

422
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:35,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where'd you send them?
- Cooper,</font>

423
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:40,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't tell you anymore
unless you agree to pilot this craft.</font>

424
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:44,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're the best pilot we ever had.
- I barely left the stratosphere.</font>

425
00:30:44,299 --> 00:30:46,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">This team
never left the simulator.</font>

426
00:30:46,769 --> 00:30:50,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need a pilot, and this is the mission
that you were trained for.</font>

427
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Without even knowing it?</font>

428
00:30:53,299 --> 00:30:56,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">An hour ago,
you didn't even know I was alive.</font>

429
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:59,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You were going anyway.
- We had no choice.</font>

430
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">But something sent you here.</font>

431
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:04,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">- They chose you.
- Who's "they"?</font>

432
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:14,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long would I be gone?</font>

433
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:17,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hard to know. Years?</font>

434
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:22,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I've got kids, professor.
- Get out there and save them.</font>

435
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:27,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's "they"?</font>

436
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:30,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">We started
detecting gravitational anomalies...</font>

437
00:31:30,299 --> 00:31:31,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">almost 50 years ago.</font>

438
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:35,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mostly small distortions to our instruments
in the upper atmosphere.</font>

439
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:38,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">In fact, I believe
you encountered one yourself.</font>

440
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:43,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, over the Straights.
My crash.</font>

441
00:31:43,099 --> 00:31:46,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Something tripped my fly-by-wire.
- Exactly.</font>

442
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:52,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">But of all these anomalies..,
the most significant is this:</font>

443
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:54,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Out near Saturn...</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">- And it leads where?
- Another galaxy.</font>

447
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:10,849

a naturally occurring phenomenon.</font>

448
00:32:10,869 --> 00:32:12,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone placed it there.</font>

449
00:32:13,029 --> 00:32:14,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">"They"?</font>

450
00:32:15,029 --> 00:32:16,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">And whoever they are..,</font>

451
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:19,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">they appear
to be looking out for us.</font>

452

<font color="#FFFFFF">That Wormhole
lets us travel to other stars.</font>

453
00:32:22,569 --> 00:32:24,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">It came along
right as we needed it.</font>

454
00:32:24,369 --> 00:32:26,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">They've put
potentially habitable worlds</font>

455

<font color="#FFFFFF">right within our reach.</font>

456

<font color="#FFFFFF">Twelve, in fact,
from our initial probes.</font>

457
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">You sent probes into that?</font>

458
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:34,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">We sent people into it.</font>

459
00:32:34,329 --> 00:32:35,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ten years ago.</font>

460
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:38,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Lazarus missions.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">carrying
the bravest humans ever to live...</font>

464
00:32:45,269 --> 00:32:48,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">led by the remarkable Dr. Mann.</font>

465
00:32:48,329 --> 00:32:51,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Each person's landing pod
had enough life support for two years.</font>

466
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:53,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">But they could use hibernation
to stretch that...</font>

over a decade or more.</font>

468
00:32:57,069 --> 00:32:59,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">Their mission
was to assess their world,</font>

469
00:32:59,329 --> 00:33:01,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">and if it showed potential...</font>

470
00:33:01,269 --> 00:33:04,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">then they could send out a signal,
bed down for the long nap,</font>

472
00:33:05,869 --> 00:33:08,000

didn't show promise?</font>

473
00:33:08,769 --> 00:33:09,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hence the bravery.</font>

474
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:13,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have the resources
to visit all 12.</font>

475
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:14,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

the Wormhole is rudimentary.</font>

on an annual basis...</font>

478

as to which worlds have potential.</font>

479
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">And one system shows promise.</font>

480
00:33:25,769 --> 00:33:28,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">One. That's a bit of
a long shot, isn't it?</font>

481
00:33:29,029 --> 00:33:32,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">One system
with three potential worlds?</font>

482
00:33:32,299 --> 00:33:34,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">No long shot.</font>

483
00:33:36,029 --> 00:33:37,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

484
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:40,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">So if we find a home...</font>

485
00:33:43,069 --> 00:33:46,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">- then what?
- That's the long shot.</font>

486
00:33:46,769 --> 00:33:49,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a Plan A and a Plan B.</font>

487
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:53,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you notice anything strange
about the launch chamber?</font>

488
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:08,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">This entire facility's a centrifuge.</font>

489
00:34:08,369 --> 00:34:11,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some kind of vehicle
or a space station?</font>

490
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:13,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Both. Plan A.</font>

491
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:15,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">How
do you get it off the ground?</font>

492
00:34:15,369 --> 00:34:19,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">The first gravitational anomalies
changed everything.</font>

493
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:23,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Suddenly we knew
that harnessing gravity was real.</font>

494
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:26,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I started
working on a theory...</font>

495
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:29,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we started
building this station.</font>

496
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:31,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you haven't solved it yet.</font>

497
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why there's Plan B.</font>

498
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:36,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">The problem is gravity.</font>

499
00:34:36,099 --> 00:34:39,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">How to get a viable amount
of human life off the planet.</font>

500
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:40,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is one way.</font>

501
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:43,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">a population bomb.</font>

502
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:45,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Over 5,000 fertilized eggs...</font>

503
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">weighing in at
just under 900 kilos.</font>

504
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, how would you raise them?
- With equipment on board..,</font>

505
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">we incubate the first 10.</font>

506
00:34:53,469 --> 00:34:57,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">After that, with surrogacy,
the growth becomes exponential.</font>

507
00:34:58,070 --> 00:35:01,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">Within 30 years,
we could have a colony of hundreds.</font>

508
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:05,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">The real difficulty with colonization
is genetic diversity.</font>

509
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">This takes care of that.</font>

510
00:35:07,369 --> 00:35:09,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now what
about the people here? You just...</font>

511
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:13,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">You give up on them? My kids?</font>

512
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:17,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why Plan A
is a lot more fun.</font>

513
00:35:19,429 --> 00:35:22,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How far have you got?
- Almost there.</font>

514
00:35:22,429 --> 00:35:25,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're asking me
to hang everything...</font>

515
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:30,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">- on an "almost".
- I'm asking you to trust me.</font>

516
00:35:33,269 --> 00:35:34,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Find us a new home.</font>

517
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:37,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">And by the time you return...</font>

518
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:40,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will have solved
the problem of gravity.</font>

519
00:35:41,929 --> 00:35:43,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">I give you my word.</font>

520
00:35:54,269 --> 00:35:57,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go away!</font>

521
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:10,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Murph.
- Go!</font>

522
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:12,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you're leaving, just go.</font>

523
00:36:15,469 --> 00:36:18,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">This world was never enough
for you, was it, Coop?</font>

524
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:20,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">What,
because heading out there</font>

525
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:23,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">is what I feel
like I was born to do?</font>

526
00:36:23,769 --> 00:36:25,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it excites me?</font>

527
00:36:26,329 --> 00:36:30,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, that does not make it wrong.
- It might.</font>

528
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:33,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't trust the right thing
done for the wrong reason.</font>

529
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">The why of the thing,
that's the foundation.</font>

530
00:36:36,829 --> 00:36:39,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the foundation's solid.</font>

531
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:47,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">We farmers, we sit here every year
when the rains fail and we say:</font>

532
00:36:47,369 --> 00:36:48,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Next year."</font>

533
00:36:49,269 --> 00:36:51,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, next year
ain't gonna save us,</font>

534
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:53,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">nor the one after that.</font>

535
00:36:53,699 --> 00:36:55,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">This world's a treasure, Donald,</font>

536
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:58,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it's been telling us
to leave for a while now.</font>

537
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:06,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mankind was born on Earth,
it was never meant to die here.</font>

538
00:37:09,829 --> 00:37:10,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tom will be all right,</font>

539
00:37:10,969 --> 00:37:12,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you got to make things right
with Murph.</font>

540
00:37:12,929 --> 00:37:14,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">I Will.</font>

541
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:18,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Without making promises
you don't know you can keep.</font>

542
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:30,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have to
talk to me, Murph.</font>

543
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:35,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to fix this before I go.</font>

544
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:38,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I'll keep it broken
so you have to stay.</font>

545
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">After you kids came along,</font>

546
00:37:41,929 --> 00:37:45,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">your mom said something to me
I never quite understood.</font>

547
00:37:45,369 --> 00:37:47,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">She said, "Now...</font>

548
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:53,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">we're just here
to be memories for our kids."</font>

549
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:01,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I think that now I understand
what she meant.</font>

550
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:05,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once you're a parent,</font>

551
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:08,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're the ghost
of your children's future.</font>

552
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:12,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said ghosts didn't exist.</font>

553
00:38:18,769 --> 00:38:20,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right, Murph.</font>

554
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Murph, look at me.</font>

555
00:38:27,829 --> 00:38:30,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I can't
be your ghost right now.</font>

556
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:34,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to exist.</font>

557
00:38:35,769 --> 00:38:37,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">They chose me.</font>

558
00:38:38,469 --> 00:38:40,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Murph, they chose me.
You saw.</font>

559
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the one
who led me to them.</font>

560
00:38:45,099 --> 00:38:47,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's exactly why you can't go.</font>

561
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:52,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">I figured out the message.</font>

562
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:55,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">One word.
You know what it is?</font>

563
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Murph.
- "Stay."</font>

564
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:01,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It says, "Stay," Dad.
- Murph.</font>

565
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't believe me.</font>

566
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:06,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at the books!
Look at this. It says, "Stay."</font>

567
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:10,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why you're not listening!
It says, "Stay!"</font>

568
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:13,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, I'm coming back.
- When?</font>

569
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:29,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">One for you, one for me.</font>

570
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:31,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I'm up there in hypersleep,</font>

571
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:35,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">or traveling near the speed of light,</font>

572
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:41,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">or near a black hole,
time's gonna change for me.</font>

573
00:39:41,429 --> 00:39:43,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know,
it's gonna run more slowly.</font>

574
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:49,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">When we get back,
we're gonna compare.</font>

575
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:52,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Time will run differently for us?
- Yeah.</font>

576
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:54,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">By the time I get back,
we'll...</font>

577
00:39:54,699 --> 00:39:58,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">we might even be
the same age, you and me.</font>

578
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">"What?" Imagine that!</font>

579
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Murph...</font>

580
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:09,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have no idea
when you're coming back.</font>

581
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">No idea at all!</font>

582
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:18,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Murph, don't...
Don't make me leave like this.</font>

583
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:19,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, Murph!</font>

584
00:40:19,869 --> 00:40:22,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't make me leave
like this, Murph!</font>

585
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey...</font>

586
00:40:31,469 --> 00:40:35,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love you. Forever.
You hear me?</font>

587
00:40:35,329 --> 00:40:38,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love you forever,
and I'm coming back.</font>

588
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm coming back.</font>

589
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:07,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How'd it go?
- Fine. Just fine.</font>

590
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:16,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love you, Tom.</font>

591
00:41:16,869 --> 00:41:18,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Travel safe?

00:53:10,070 --> 00:53:12,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">But not a poker face, Slick.</font>

740
00:53:24,429 --> 00:53:25,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, guys.</font>

741
00:53:26,269 --> 00:53:29,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dad's about to
go down for the long nap.</font>

742
00:53:29,699 --> 00:53:32,400
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>So I wanted
to give you an update.</i></font>

743
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:36,800
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>The Earth looks amazing
from here.</i></font>

744
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:41,269
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Um, you can't see
any of the dust.</i></font>

745
00:53:41,469 --> 00:53:45,670
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Um, I really hope
you guys are doing great.</i></font>

746
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:47,150
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I know you gonna get this message.</i></font>

747
00:53:47,170 --> 00:53:50,599
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Professor Brand's assured me
that he'll get it to you.</i></font>

748
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:52,800
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Know that I love you.</i></font>

749
00:53:54,099 --> 00:53:56,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is it him?
- I don't think so, Murph.</font>

750
00:54:03,570 --> 00:54:05,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must be Donald.</font>

751
00:54:07,099 --> 00:54:08,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Murph.</font>

752
00:54:09,199 --> 00:54:11,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you
in my dad's truck?</font>

753
00:54:11,699 --> 00:54:13,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wanted me
to bring it for your brother.</font>

754
00:54:14,570 --> 00:54:16,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">He sent you a message.</font>

755
00:54:20,070 --> 00:54:22,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's
pretty upset with him for leaving.</font>

756
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:23,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you record any messages,</font>

757
00:54:23,730 --> 00:54:26,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can get them to
transmit it to Cooper.</font>

758
00:54:27,199 --> 00:54:30,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Murph is a bright spark.</font>

759
00:54:30,929 --> 00:54:33,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe I should fan the flame.</font>

760
00:54:33,699 --> 00:54:36,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's already
making fools of her teachers.</font>

761
00:54:36,429 --> 00:54:39,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">So maybe she should come
and make a fool out of you.</font>

762
00:54:40,269 --> 00:54:43,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So where are they?
- Heading for Mars.</font>

763
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:48,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">The next time you hear from Cooper,
they'll be coming up on Saturn.</font>

764
00:55:27,239 --> 00:55:28,599
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>As far as school goes...</i></font>

765
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:31,500
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>the administration wants me
to repeat Plant Pathology.</i></font>

766
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:33,000
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Which sucks.</i></font>

767
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:36,730
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>But they said I could start
Advanced Agriculture a year early.</i></font>

768
00:55:38,429 --> 00:55:42,500
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>All right, I got to go, Dad.
Hope you're safe up there.</i></font>

769
00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:48,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, Coop.</font>

770
00:55:48,030 --> 00:55:50,170
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I asked Murph to say hi,</i></font>

771
00:55:50,199 --> 00:55:53,000
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>but she's as stubborn
as her old man</i></font>

772
00:55:53,329 --> 00:55:55,400
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I'll try again next time.</i></font>

773
00:56:10,199 --> 00:56:13,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">You all right, Rom?</font>

774
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:16,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">This gets to me, Cooper.</font>

775
00:56:16,099 --> 00:56:17,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This.
- This.</font>

776
00:56:18,199 --> 00:56:19,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Millimeters of aluminum,
that's it..,</font>

777
00:56:19,969 --> 00:56:21,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then nothing out there...</font>

778
00:56:21,849 --> 00:56:25,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">for millions of miles
won't kill us in seconds.</font>

779
00:56:26,369 --> 00:56:30,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know that some of the finest
solo yachtsmen in the world...</font>

780
00:56:30,699 --> 00:56:33,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">don't know how to swim?
They don't know how.</font>

781
00:56:33,630 --> 00:56:35,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if they go overboard,
psst, they're done.</font>

782
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:39,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're explorers, Rom.</font>

783
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:43,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is our boat here.</font>

784
00:57:11,230 --> 00:57:13,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is from the, relay probe?</font>

785
00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:15,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was in orbit
around the Wormhole.</font>

786
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:18,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the Wormhole,
and every time we'd come around...</font>

787
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">we would receive images
from the other side of the foreign galaxy.</font>

788
00:57:22,429 --> 00:57:24,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.
Like swinging a periscope around.</font>

789
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:25,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Exactly.</font>

790
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we got a pretty good idea...</font>

791
00:57:27,929 --> 00:57:30,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">what we're gonna find
on the other side?</font>

792
00:57:31,469 --> 00:57:33,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Navigationally.</font>

793
00:57:34,269 --> 00:57:35,170
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Guys, listen.</i></font>

794
00:57:35,199 --> 00:57:38,300
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>We'll be approaching
the Wormhole in about three hours.</i></font>

795
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:45,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Coop?</font>

796
00:57:46,369 --> 00:57:48,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can we stop the spinning?</font>

797
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:49,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

798
00:57:49,530 --> 00:57:52,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because we're close enough
to see it now?</font>

799
00:57:53,869 --> 00:57:56,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">- All right.
- Thanks.</font>

800
00:58:01,929 --> 00:58:04,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">There, that's it! That's the Wormhole!</font>

801
00:58:04,269 --> 00:58:07,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say it, don't spray it, Rom.
It's a sphere.</font>

802
00:58:07,670 --> 00:58:09,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course it is.
What, you...?</font>

803
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:11,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">You thought
it'd just be a hole?</font>

804
00:58:12,699 --> 00:58:15,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it's just that all the illustrations
I've ever seen, they...</font>

805
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:19,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the illustrations,
they're trying to show you how it works.</font>

806
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:24,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">So they say you want
to go from here to there.</font>

807
00:58:24,599 --> 00:58:27,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it's too far, right?</font>

808
00:58:27,130 --> 00:58:32,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">So a Wormhole bends space like this,
so you can take a shortcut through...</font>

809
00:58:32,230 --> 00:58:33,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">a higher dimension.</font>

810
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:36,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, so, to show that,</font>

811
00:58:36,730 --> 00:58:39,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">they've turned three-dimensional space
into two dimensions...</font>

812
00:58:39,829 --> 00:58:43,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">which turns a Wormhole
into two dimensions, a circle.</font>

813
00:58:43,969 --> 00:58:46,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's a circle
in three dimensions?</font>

814
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:50,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">- A sphere.
- Exactly. A spherical hole.</font>

815
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:54,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">But who put it there?
Who do we have to thank?</font>

816
00:58:54,730 --> 00:58:56,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not thanking anybody</font>

817
00:58:56,530 --> 00:58:59,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">until we get out of here
in one piece, Rom.</font>

818
00:59:06,269 --> 00:59:08,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any trick to this, Doyle?</font>

819
00:59:09,369 --> 00:59:11,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one knows.</font>

820
00:59:18,170 --> 00:59:19,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">The others made it, right?</font>

821
00:59:21,929 --> 00:59:23,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">At least some of them.</font>

822
00:59:55,469 --> 00:59:58,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody ready to say goodbye
to our solar system?</font>

823
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:01,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">To our galaxy.</font>

824
01:00:03,369 --> 01:00:04,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here we go.</font>

825
01:00:37,030 --> 01:00:38,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">The controls won't work here.</font>

826
01:00:38,969 --> 01:00:40,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're passing through the bulk.</font>

827
01:00:40,730 --> 01:00:43,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's space
beyond our three dimensions.</font>

828
01:00:43,230 --> 01:00:45,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">All you can do
is record and observe.</font>

829
01:00:56,429 --> 01:00:58,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is that?</font>

830
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I think it's them.
- Distorting space-time.</font>

831
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't! Don't!</font>

832
01:01:33,199 --> 01:01:35,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">What was that?</font>

833
01:01:39,170 --> 01:01:40,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">The first handshake.</font>

834
01:01:42,369 --> 01:01:43,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're...</font>

835
01:01:45,099 --> 01:01:46,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're here.</font>

836
01:02:07,070 --> 01:02:09,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">So the lost communications came through.</font>

837
01:02:09,130 --> 01:02:12,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How?
- The relay on this side cached them.</font>

838
01:02:12,269 --> 01:02:15,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">So years of basic data.
No real surprises.</font>

839
01:02:16,599 --> 01:02:18,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">Miller's site
has kept pinging thumbs up,</font>

840
01:02:18,449 --> 01:02:20,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">as has Dr. Mann's. Um...</font>

841
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:22,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Edmunds' went down
three years ago.</font>

842
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Transmitter failure?
- Maybe.</font>

843
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:27,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was sending the thumbs up
right until it went dark.</font>

844
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:29,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">But Miller's
still looks good though, right?</font>

845
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:31,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because she's coming up fast.</font>

846
01:02:32,099 --> 01:02:34,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">With one complication.</font>

847
01:02:34,599 --> 01:02:37,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">The planet is much closer to Gargantua
than we thought.</font>

848
01:02:37,769 --> 01:02:40,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Gargantua?
- It's what we're calling the black hole.</font>

849
01:02:40,630 --> 01:02:42,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Miller's and Dr. Mann's planets
both orbit it.</font>

850
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:46,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And Miller's is on the horizon?
- As a basketball around a hoop.</font>

851
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:48,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Landing there
takes us dangerously close.</font>

852
01:02:48,530 --> 01:02:51,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">And a black hole that big
has a huge gravitational pull.</font>

853
01:02:54,519 --> 01:02:55,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I could swing...</font>

854
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:59,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">- around that neutron star to decelerate.
- No, it's not that. It's time.</font>

855
01:02:59,329 --> 01:03:00,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">The gravity on that planet</font>

856
01:03:00,630 --> 01:03:04,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">will slow our clock
compared to Earth's drastically.</font>

857
01:03:04,829 --> 01:03:05,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">How bad?</font>

858
01:03:06,190 --> 01:03:08,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every hour
we spend on that planet...</font>

859
01:03:08,329 --> 01:03:12,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">will be,
seven years back on Earth.</font>

860
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:16,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Jesus.
- Well, that's relativity, folks.</font>

861
01:03:18,170 --> 01:03:20,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we can't
just drop down there without...</font>

862
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:22,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cooper, we have a mission.</font>

863
01:03:22,829 --> 01:03:24,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, Doyle,
we have a mission,</font>

864
01:03:24,150 --> 01:03:26,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">and our mission Plan A
is to find a planet...</font>

865
01:03:26,570 --> 01:03:27,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">that can habitate the people..</font>

866
01:03:27,670 --> 01:03:30,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That are living on Earth now.
- You can't just think about your family.</font>

867
01:03:30,329 --> 01:03:31,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now you have to think
bigger than that, all right?</font>

868
01:03:31,829 --> 01:03:35,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am thinking about my family
and millions of other families, okay?</font>

869
01:03:35,150 --> 01:03:36,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Plan A does not work...</font>

870
01:03:36,599 --> 01:03:39,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">if the people on Earth are dead
by the time we pull it off.</font>

871
01:03:40,670 --> 01:03:42,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. It doesn't.</font>

872
01:03:42,929 --> 01:03:44,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why there's a Plan B.</font>

873
01:03:46,269 --> 01:03:48,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.
Cooper's right.</font>

874
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:49,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to think about time
as a resource,</font>

875
01:03:49,730 --> 01:03:52,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">just like oxygen and food.
Going down there is gonna cost us.</font>

876
01:03:54,199 --> 01:03:55,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, look.</font>

877
01:03:56,829 --> 01:03:59,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dr. Mann's data
is promising, right,</font>

878
01:03:59,130 --> 01:04:00,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it's going to take us months
to get there.</font>

879
01:04:00,730 --> 01:04:02,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Edmunds', it's even further.</font>

880
01:04:02,670 --> 01:04:04,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Miller hasn't sent much,
but what she has sent...</font>

881
01:04:04,699 --> 01:04:07,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">is very promising.
It's water, it's organics...</font>

882
01:04:07,050 --> 01:04:09,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You don't find that every day.
- No, you don't.</font>

883
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:10,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">And just think about the resources,</font>

884
01:04:10,949 --> 01:04:14,599

trying to get back here.</font>

885
01:04:15,769 --> 01:04:17,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Romilly.
- Yeah?</font>

886
01:04:17,199 --> 01:04:19,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">How far off from Miller's planet
do we have to be...</font>

887
01:04:19,670 --> 01:04:23,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">- to stay out of the time shift?
- Just back from the cusp.</font>

888
01:04:23,469 --> 01:04:26,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, which is here,
just outside of Miller's planet.</font>

889
01:04:26,429 --> 01:04:28,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Right.
- Okay.</font>

890
01:04:29,070 --> 01:04:32,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's Gargantua.
Here's Miller's planet.</font>

891
01:04:32,429 --> 01:04:35,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Instead of taking the Endurance
into orbit around Miller's planet...</font>

892
01:04:35,369 --> 01:04:38,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">which would conserve fuel,
but we would lose a lot of time...</font>

893
01:04:38,469 --> 01:04:41,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">what if we take
a wider orbit around Gargantua,</font>

894
01:04:41,730 --> 01:04:45,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">parallel with Miller's planet
outside of this time shift, to here?</font>

895
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:48,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then we take the Ranger down,
we get Miller, we get her samples.</font>

896
01:04:48,329 --> 01:04:51,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">We come back, we analyze, we debrief.
We're in, we're out.</font>

897
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:53,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">We lose a little fuel,
but we save a whole lot of time.</font>

898
01:04:53,769 --> 01:04:55,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That'll work.
- That's good.</font>

899
01:04:55,699 --> 01:04:58,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's not gonna be time for
monkey business or chit-chat down there.</font>

900
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:01,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, TARS:
you should definitely stay here.</font>

901
01:05:01,099 --> 01:05:03,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're with me.
Anyone else can stay.</font>

902
01:05:03,699 --> 01:05:06,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we're talking about
a couple years,</font>

903
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:08,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could use the time
to research gravity.</font>

904
01:05:08,099 --> 01:05:10,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Observations from the Wormhole,
that's gold to Professor Brand.</font>

905
01:05:10,829 --> 01:05:12,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">factor an orbit of Gargantua.</font>

906
01:05:12,730 --> 01:05:15,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Conserve fuel, minimize thrusting,</font>

907
01:05:15,170 --> 01:05:17,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">but make sure
we stay in range of Miller's planet.</font>

908
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:20,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You got it?
- I wouldn't leave you behind...</font>

909
01:05:20,329 --> 01:05:21,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dr. Brand.</font>

910
01:05:25,869 --> 01:05:27,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You ready, CASE?
- Yup.</font>

911
01:05:28,429 --> 01:05:32,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You don't say much, do you?
- TARS talks plenty for both of us.</font>

912
01:05:33,130 --> 01:05:34,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Detach.</font>

913
01:05:41,530 --> 01:05:44,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Romilly, are you reading these forces?
<i>- It's unbelievable.</i></font>

914
01:05:47,730 --> 01:05:50,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">A literal heart of darkness.</font>

915
01:05:53,969 --> 01:05:56,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we could just see
the collapsed star inside...</font>

916
01:05:56,869 --> 01:05:59,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">the singularity,
yeah, we'd solve gravity.</font>

917
01:06:00,030 --> 01:06:03,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And we can't get anything from it?
- <i>Nothing escapes that horizon.</i></font>

918
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:04,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not even light.</font>

919
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:07,300
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>the answer's there,
just no way to see it.</i></font>

920
01:06:07,469 --> 01:06:09,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's Miller's planet.</font>

921
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:13,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goodbye, Ranger.</font>

922
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:27,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is fast
for atmospheric entry.</font>

923
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:30,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Should we use the thrusters to slow?
- No.</font>

924
01:06:30,699 --> 01:06:33,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna use the Ranger's aerodynamics
to save some fuel.</font>

925
01:06:34,030 --> 01:06:36,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Air brake?
- We want to get down fast, don't we?</font>

926
01:06:36,969 --> 01:06:38,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, we wanna
get there in one piece.</font>

927
01:06:39,269 --> 01:06:42,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hang on.
- Brand, Doyle, get ready.</font>

928
01:06:58,369 --> 01:07:00,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We should ease!
- Hands where I can see them.</font>

929
01:07:00,599 --> 01:07:02,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">The only time I went down</font>

930
01:07:02,070 --> 01:07:04,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">was when a machine was easing
at the wrong time.</font>

931
01:07:04,099 --> 01:07:07,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">- A little caution...
- Can get you killed, like reckless driving.</font>

932
01:07:07,329 --> 01:07:09,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Cooper, it's too damn fast!
- I got this.</font>

933
01:07:14,369 --> 01:07:18,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Should I disable the feedback?
- No. I need to feel the air.</font>

934
01:07:22,269 --> 01:07:23,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here we go.</font>

935
01:07:26,579 --> 01:07:27,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just water!</font>

936
01:07:29,269 --> 01:07:32,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The stuff of life.
- Twelve hundred meters.</font>

937
01:07:32,969 --> 01:07:34,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do we have a fix on the beacon?
- Got it!</font>

938
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Can you maneuver?
- I'll need to shave some speed.</font>

939
01:07:37,969 --> 01:07:40,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna spiral down on top of it.
Everybody hang on!</font>

940
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:44,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seven hundred.</font>

941
01:07:46,199 --> 01:07:48,500

- No.</font>

945
01:08:20,199 --> 01:08:23,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">But very efficient.</font>

946
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:26,069

01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:29,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go! Go, go, go!</font>

948
01:08:29,369 --> 01:08:32,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seven years per hour here.
Let's make it count!</font>

949
01:08:58,729 --> 01:09:00,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">This way.</font>

950
01:09:02,829 --> 01:09:04,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">About 200 meters.</font>

951
01:09:14,130 --> 01:09:16,300

01:09:22,430 --> 01:09:24,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, come on.</font>

955
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:29,000

<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Where's the rest?</i></font>

960
01:09:56,130 --> 01:09:57,800

- What? What?</font>

963
01:10:11,619 --> 01:10:14,500

<font color="#FFFFFF">That one's moving away from us.</font>

965
01:10:23,229 --> 01:10:25,000

back to the Ranger now!</font>

967

<i>We do not have time!</i></font>

969
01:10:44,250 --> 01:10:47,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">The second wave is coming!
We're in the middle of a swell.</font>

970
01:10:48,069 --> 01:10:49,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I got it.</font>

971
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:52,100

back to the Ranger now!</font>

972
01:10:56,729 --> 01:10:59,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brand, get back here now!</font>

973
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:03,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Cooper, go.
Cooper, go. I can't make it.</font>

974
01:11:03,350 --> 01:11:06,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Go!
go get her.</font>

975
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:12,770

977
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:20,199

978
01:11:26,470 --> 01:11:29,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, CASE has her!
Get back here, Doyle!</font>

979
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:33,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on!</font>

980
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:36,899

Manually overriding inside hatch!</font>

983
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:57,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! Wait!</font>

984
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:07,899

I'm gonna have to shut her down.</font>

985
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,399

986
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:48,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hang on!</font>

987
01:13:19,329 --> 01:13:23,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">what's the problem?
- Too waterlogged. Let it drain.</font>

988
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:25,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goddamn it!</font>

989
01:13:25,670 --> 01:13:27,869

- to get your ass back here!</font>

991
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:32,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">The difference is one of us
was thinking about the mission!</font>

992
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:34,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cooper, you were thinking
about getting home.</font>

993
01:13:37,029 --> 01:13:39,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was trying
to do the right thing!</font>

994
01:13:39,470 --> 01:13:41,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you tell that to Doyle?</font>

995
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:46,229

- Forty-five to an hour.</font>

996
01:13:47,869 --> 01:13:51,470

What's this gonna cost us, Brand?</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">A lot. Decades.</font>

998
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:05,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What happened to Miller?
- Judging by the wreckage,</font>

999
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">she was broken up
by a wave soon after impact.</font>

1000
01:14:09,529 --> 01:14:12,229

after all these years?</font>

1001
01:14:13,399 --> 01:14:15,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because of the time slippage.</font>

1002
01:14:16,430 --> 01:14:21,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">On this planet's time,
she just landed hours ago.</font>

1003
01:14:21,899 --> 01:14:24,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">She probably just died
minutes ago.</font>

1004
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:28,699

I screwed up. I'm sorry.</font>

1149
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:27,500

the underlying assumption about time.</font>

- And that means...</font>

1153
01:24:36,329 --> 01:24:40,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">each iteration is an attempt
to prove its own proof.</font>

1154
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's recursive.
It's nonsensical.</font>

1155
01:24:43,369 --> 01:24:47,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you calling my life's work
nonsense, Murph?</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I'm saying
that you've been trying...</font>

with both arms, tied behind your back.</font>

01:25:45,369 --> 01:25:46,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">But how?</font>

1172
01:25:47,529 --> 01:25:49,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're both promising.</font>

1173
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:52,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Edmunds' data is better,</font>

1174
01:25:52,699 --> 01:25:55,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">but Dr. Mann is the one
still transmitting, so...</font>

1175
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:58,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've no reason to suspect
Edmunds's data would have soured.</font>

1176
01:25:59,569 --> 01:26:02,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">His world has key elements
to sustain human life.</font>

1177
01:26:02,069 --> 01:26:05,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">- As does Dr. Mann's.
- Cooper, this is my field.</font>

1178
01:26:06,409 --> 01:26:07,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">And...</font>

1179
01:26:08,529 --> 01:26:10,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">I really believe Edmunds'
is the better prospect.</font>

1180
01:26:10,430 --> 01:26:13,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why?
- Gargantua, that's why.</font>

1181
01:26:15,100 --> 01:26:16,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at Miller's planet..</font>

1182
01:26:16,729 --> 01:26:21,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hydrocarbons, organics, yes,
but no life. It's sterile.</font>

1183
01:26:22,430 --> 01:26:25,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We'll find the same thing on Mann's.
- Because of the black hole?</font>

1184
01:26:26,029 --> 01:26:29,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Murphy's Law.
"Whatever can happen will happen."</font>

1185
01:26:29,229 --> 01:26:31,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Accident is the first building block
of evolution.</font>

1186
01:26:31,770 --> 01:26:34,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">But when you're orbiting a black hole
not enough can happen.</font>

1187
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">It sucks in asteroids and comets,</font>

1188
01:26:37,399 --> 01:26:39,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">other events which would
otherwise reach you.</font>

1189
01:26:39,430 --> 01:26:41,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to go further afield.</font>

1190
01:26:41,869 --> 01:26:44,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">You once said that Dr. Mann...</font>

1191
01:26:45,670 --> 01:26:48,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">- was the best of us.
- He's remarkable.</font>

1192
01:26:48,899 --> 01:26:50,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're only here because of him.</font>

1193
01:26:50,970 --> 01:26:54,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">And yet here he is.
He's on the ground,</font>

1194
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:57,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he's sending
a very unambiguous message,</font>

1195
01:26:57,300 --> 01:26:59,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">telling us
to come to his planet.</font>

1196
01:26:59,930 --> 01:27:04,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Granted, but Edmunds' data
is more promising.</font>

1197
01:27:05,170 --> 01:27:06,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should vote.</font>

1198
01:27:06,270 --> 01:27:09,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, if we vote,
there's something you should know.</font>

1199
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:12,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brand?
He has a right to know.</font>

1200
01:27:13,079 --> 01:27:14,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">That has nothing to do with it.</font>

1201
01:27:14,970 --> 01:27:18,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What does?
- She's in love with Wolf Edmunds.</font>

1202
01:27:18,130 --> 01:27:20,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is that true?
- Yes.</font>

1203
01:27:23,770 --> 01:27:26,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that makes me
want to follow my heart.</font>

1204
01:27:29,989 --> 01:27:33,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">But maybe we've spent too long
trying to figure all this outwith theory.</font>

1205
01:27:33,699 --> 01:27:36,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're a scientist, Brand.
- So listen to me...</font>

1206
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:42,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">when I say that love
isn't something we invented.</font>

1207
01:27:43,399 --> 01:27:45,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's observable, powerful.</font>

1208
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:51,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It has to mean something.
- Love has meaning, yes.</font>

1209
01:27:51,199 --> 01:27:53,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Social utility, social bonding,</font>

1210
01:27:53,069 --> 01:27:55,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">- child rearing...
- We love people who have died.</font>

1211
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:59,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where's the social utility in that?
- None.</font>

1212
01:27:59,699 --> 01:28:01,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe it means something more,</font>

1213
01:28:01,750 --> 01:28:05,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">something we can't,
yet, understand.</font>

1214
01:28:05,770 --> 01:28:08,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe it's some evidence,</font>

1215
01:28:10,270 --> 01:28:14,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">some artifact of a higher dimension
that we can't consciously perceive.</font>

1216
01:28:14,909 --> 01:28:17,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm drawn across the universe</font>

1217
01:28:17,300 --> 01:28:19,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">to someone
I haven't seen in a decade...</font>

1218
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:22,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">who I know is probably dead.</font>

1219
01:28:22,899 --> 01:28:26,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Love is the one thing
we're capable of perceiving...</font>

1220
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:29,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">that transcends dimensions
of time and space.</font>

1221
01:28:31,199 --> 01:28:35,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe we should trust that,
even if we can't understand it yet.</font>

1222
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:42,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, Cooper...</font>

1223
01:28:44,130 --> 01:28:50,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">yes, the tiniest possibility
of seeing Wolf again excites me.</font>

1224
01:28:50,699 --> 01:28:52,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">That doesn't mean I'm wrong.</font>

1225
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:55,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Honestly, Amelia...</font>

1226
01:28:57,069 --> 01:28:58,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">it might.</font>

1227
01:29:05,029 --> 01:29:07,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">chart a course for Dr. Mann's.</font>

1228
01:29:24,770 --> 01:29:27,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll lose
about a third again. But next year...</font>

1229
01:29:30,130 --> 01:29:33,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Next year I'm gonna work Nelson's farm
and we'll make it up.</font>

1230
01:29:33,770 --> 01:29:35,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened to Nelson?</font>

1231
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:43,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Murph, would you like
some more souffle'?</font>

1232
01:29:43,829 --> 01:29:47,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. I'm full, thanks.
It was delicious.</font>

1233
01:29:48,130 --> 01:29:50,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Coop, finish your fritter, please.</font>

1234
01:29:52,329 --> 01:29:53,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you spend the night?</font>

1235
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your room is exactly as you left it.</font>

1236
01:29:56,029 --> 01:29:57,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's ready.
- I need to get back.</font>

1237
01:29:57,729 --> 01:29:58,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">My sewing machine is in there,</font>

1238
01:29:58,970 --> 01:30:01,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">- but there's plenty...
- I need to...</font>

1239
01:30:04,539 --> 01:30:05,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Too many memories.</font>

1240
01:30:05,930 --> 01:30:09,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">We might have something
for that. Hey, Coop.</font>

1241
01:30:17,170 --> 01:30:18,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">The dust.</font>

1242
01:30:20,930 --> 01:30:25,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lois, I have a friend who could
look at his lungs.</font>

1243
01:30:43,779 --> 01:30:46,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Amelia, I'm sorry.
- You were just being objective.</font>

1244
01:30:46,329 --> 01:30:49,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unless you're punishing me
for screwing up on Miller's planet.</font>

1245
01:30:49,899 --> 01:30:52,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, this wasn't
a personal decision.</font>

1246
01:30:53,130 --> 01:30:57,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, if you're wrong, you will have
a very personal decision to make.</font>

1247
01:30:57,130 --> 01:31:00,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your fuel calculations
are based on a return journey.</font>

1248
01:31:00,770 --> 01:31:02,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Strike out on Mann's planet,</font>

1249
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:04,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we'll have to decide
whether to return home...</font>

1250
01:31:04,699 --> 01:31:07,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">or push on to Edmunds'
with Plan B.</font>

1251
01:31:07,199 --> 01:31:11,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Starting a colony could save us
from extinction.</font>

1252
01:31:11,399 --> 01:31:14,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">You might have to decide
between seeing your children again...</font>

1253
01:31:14,670 --> 01:31:16,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the future of the human race.</font>

1254
01:31:17,829 --> 01:31:19,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">I trust you'll be as objective then.</font>

1255
01:31:26,300 --> 01:31:28,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's been asking for you
since he came to.</font>

1256
01:31:28,729 --> 01:31:30,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were trying to reach you.</font>

1257
01:31:36,399 --> 01:31:37,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Murph.</font>

1258
01:31:38,199 --> 01:31:42,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm here, professor.
- I let you all down.</font>

1259
01:31:42,869 --> 01:31:46,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you got us so far.
Real close.</font>

1260
01:31:48,170 --> 01:31:51,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'll finish what you started.
- Good. Good, Murph.</font>

1261
01:31:54,699 --> 01:31:57,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">You had faith...</font>

1262
01:31:58,199 --> 01:31:59,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">all those...</font>

1263
01:32:00,470 --> 01:32:02,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">all those years.</font>

1264
01:32:03,930 --> 01:32:05,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">I...</font>

1265
01:32:05,300 --> 01:32:07,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">I asked you to have faith.</font>

1266
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:12,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanted you to believe...</font>

1267
01:32:13,869 --> 01:32:15,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">that your father...</font>

1268
01:32:18,770 --> 01:32:22,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">- would come back.
- I do, professor.</font>

1269
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:27,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Forgive me, Murph.
- There's nothing to forgive.</font>

1270
01:32:32,060 --> 01:32:34,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">I lied, Murph.</font>

1271
01:32:36,399 --> 01:32:38,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">I lied to you.</font>

1272
01:32:44,470 --> 01:32:47,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">There was no need for him to...</font>

1273
01:32:48,970 --> 01:32:50,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">To come back.</font>

1274
01:32:53,369 --> 01:32:56,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is no way to help us.</font>

1275
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:03,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">But Plan A...
All this. All these people.</font>

1276
01:33:03,729 --> 01:33:05,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the equation.</font>

1277
01:33:09,729 --> 01:33:11,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did my father know?</font>

1278
01:33:15,199 --> 01:33:17,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did he leave me?</font>

1279
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:25,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do... not...</font>

1280
01:33:25,470 --> 01:33:29,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">go... gentle...</font>

1281
01:33:31,399 --> 01:33:35,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No!</font>

1282
01:33:36,569 --> 01:33:38,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't leave.</font>

1283
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:39,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">You... No.</font>

1284
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:44,399
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Dr. Brand, I'm sorry to tell you
that your father died today.</i></font>

1285
01:33:44,500 --> 01:33:48,000

He was at peace.</i></font>

1289
01:34:11,899 --> 01:34:13,600

1291
01:34:21,369 --> 01:34:23,500
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>You left us here.</i></font>

1292
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,770
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>To suffocate.</i></font>

1293
01:34:28,699 --> 01:34:30,369

01:34:57,600 --> 01:34:58,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Frozen cloud.</font>

1295
01:37:23,170 --> 01:37:24,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay.</font>

1296
01:37:24,729 --> 01:37:26,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay.</font>

1297
01:37:32,899 --> 01:37:34,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay.</font>

1298
01:37:40,100 --> 01:37:42,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pray you never learn...</font>

1299
01:37:43,270 --> 01:37:46,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">just how good it can be
to see another face.</font>

1300
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hadn't a lot of hope
to begin with,</font>

1301
01:37:57,630 --> 01:38:00,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">but after so long,
I had none.</font>

1302
01:38:01,470 --> 01:38:04,470

I didn't even set a waking date.</font>

raised me from the dead.</font>

1305
01:38:17,569 --> 01:38:19,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lazarus.</font>

1306

- I'm afraid you're it, sir.</font>

1307
01:38:24,670 --> 01:38:27,000

1308
01:38:27,810 --> 01:38:29,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, our present situation...</font>

1309

I decommissioned him...</font>

to see into a black hole.</font>

- We can't, Coop.</font>

1381
01:42:58,869 --> 01:43:01,399

that aren't meant to be known.</font>

1382
01:43:01,500 --> 01:43:03,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your father had to find
another way...</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">to save the human race
from extinction.</font>

1384

<font color="#FFFFFF">- A colony.
- Why not tell people?</font>

1385
01:43:10,720 --> 01:43:13,829

- Because he knew how hard it would be...</font>

to save the species instead of themselves.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">- Or their children.
- Bullshit.</font>

1388

<font color="#FFFFFF">You never would've come
unless you believed you would save them.</font>

1389
01:43:23,899 --> 01:43:26,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Evolution has yet to transcend
that simple barrier.</font>

1390
01:43:26,430 --> 01:43:30,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can care deeply,
selflessly, about those we know,</font>

beyond our line of sight.</font>

1392

<font color="#FFFFFF">But the lie.</font>

1393
01:43:38,600 --> 01:43:41,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">That monstrous lie?</font>

1394
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,800

And he knew that.</font>

who are gonna die!</font>

1400
01:43:59,369 --> 01:44:01,649

1401
01:44:02,029 --> 01:44:04,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">he declared their case hopeless.</font>

1402

1403

- No. No.</font>

1404
01:44:11,100 --> 01:44:12,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are the future.</font>

1405
01:44:16,270 --> 01:44:18,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cooper, what can I do?</font>

1406
01:44:21,529 --> 01:44:23,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me go home.</font>

1407
01:44:23,829 --> 01:44:25,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're absolutely positive?</font>

1408
01:44:26,510 --> 01:44:29,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">His solution was correct.
He'd had it for years.</font>

1409
01:44:29,569 --> 01:44:32,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's worthless?
- It's half the answer.</font>

1410
01:44:33,130 --> 01:44:36,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, how do you find
the other half?</font>

1411
01:44:36,970 --> 01:44:40,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Out there? A black hole.
But stuck down here on Earth?</font>

1412
01:44:40,500 --> 01:44:42,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah?</font>

1413
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:44,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not sure you can.</font>

1414
01:44:46,369 --> 01:44:49,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">God, they just pack up and leave.</font>

1415
01:44:50,529 --> 01:44:53,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are they hoping to find?</font>

1416
01:44:53,229 --> 01:44:55,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Survival.</font>

1417
01:45:01,699 --> 01:45:03,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn it.</font>

1418
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Murph. Don't...?</font>

1419
01:45:08,600 --> 01:45:12,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Don't people have a right to know?
- Panic won't help.</font>

1420
01:45:12,300 --> 01:45:14,630

same as ever.</font>

1421
01:45:14,699 --> 01:45:17,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but isn't that exactly
what Professor Brand...</font>

1424
01:45:22,029 --> 01:45:25,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, do you have an idea?</font>

1425
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:28,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">A feeling.</font>

1426
01:45:31,670 --> 01:45:33,770
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I told you about my ghost.</i></font>

1427

<font color="#FFFFFF">It felt like a person.</font>

1432
01:45:56,500 --> 01:45:58,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was trying to tell me something.</font>

1433
01:46:00,829 --> 01:46:02,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">If there's an answer here on Earth,</font>

1434
01:46:02,550 --> 01:46:06,500

1435
01:46:06,770 --> 01:46:08,500

1436
01:46:11,930 --> 01:46:13,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're running out of time.</font>

1437

auxiliary oxygen scrubbers?</font>

1438
01:46:17,729 --> 01:46:20,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, they can stay.
I'll be sleeping anyway.</font>

1440
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:23,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a suggestion

1441
01:46:24,029 --> 01:46:26,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, what's that?
- Have one last crack at the black hole.</font>

1442
01:46:28,770 --> 01:46:31,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm going home, Rom.
- Yeah, I know.</font>

1443
01:46:31,369 --> 01:46:33,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">This isn't gonna
cost you any time.</font>

1444
01:46:34,529 --> 01:46:36,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a chance
for the people on Earth.</font>

1445
01:46:36,899 --> 01:46:40,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Talk to me.
- Gargantua's an older spinning black hole.</font>

1446
01:46:40,100 --> 01:46:43,050

a gentle singularity.</font>

1447
01:46:43,250 --> 01:46:45,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Gentle?
- They're hardly gentle.</font>

1448

- After the horizon is a complete mystery.</font>

1451
01:46:57,300 --> 01:47:00,329

there isn't some way that the probe...</font>

1452
01:47:00,350 --> 01:47:03,329

every form of energy that can pulse.</font>

become a "He," professor?</font>

1455
01:47:10,340 --> 01:47:12,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">TARS is the obvious candidate.</font>

1457
01:47:14,829 --> 01:47:17,699

01:47:24,199 --> 01:47:27,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Your cue light's broken.
- I'm not joking.</font>

1462
01:47:29,930 --> 01:47:33,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll need TARS to remove and adapt
some components from KIPP:</font>

1463
01:47:33,369 --> 01:47:35,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I don't wanna disturb
his archival functions.</font>

1464
01:47:35,829 --> 01:47:38,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'll supervise.
- All right.</font>

1465
01:47:38,869 --> 01:47:41,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dr. Mann, we need to find
three secure sites.</font>

1466
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:44,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">One for Brand's lab,
two for habitat.</font>

1467
01:47:44,029 --> 01:47:46,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">And once those modules have landed,
you don't want to move them.</font>

1468
01:47:46,329 --> 01:47:49,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can take you to the probe sites,
but I don't think...</font>

1469
01:47:49,229 --> 01:47:51,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">these conditions gonna hold hold.
I think we should wait.</font>

1470
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">CASE is headed down
with the rest of the distillery equipment.</font>

1471
01:47:54,930 --> 01:47:58,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd really like
to secure those sites by nightfall.</font>

1472
01:47:59,699 --> 01:48:03,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, these squalls
do usually blow over.</font>

1473
01:48:03,300 --> 01:48:05,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay, then.
- What you gonna need...</font>

1474
01:48:05,130 --> 01:48:06,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">- is a long-range transmitter.
- Got it.</font>

1475
01:48:06,899 --> 01:48:08,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are you charged?
- Yeah.</font>

1476
01:48:08,970 --> 01:48:10,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Follow me.</font>

1477
01:48:10,770 --> 01:48:13,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">72 hours, yeah?</font>

1478
01:48:13,149 --> 01:48:14,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Roger that, Cooper.</font>

1479
01:48:20,699 --> 01:48:23,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brand told me why you feel
you have to go back.</font>

1480
01:48:25,300 --> 01:48:28,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I'd be remiss
if I didn't at least mention...</font>

1481
01:48:28,500 --> 01:48:32,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">that a mission such as ours
could certainly use an extra engineer.</font>

1482
01:48:34,369 --> 01:48:36,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">You better slow down, turbo.</font>

1483
01:48:37,069 --> 01:48:41,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Safety first, CASE: remember.
<i>- Safety first, Cooper.</i></font>

1484
01:48:42,430 --> 01:48:45,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to tell you, Dr. Mann,
I'm honored to be a part of this.</font>

1485
01:48:45,770 --> 01:48:49,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">But once we set up base camp
and secure those modules,</font>

1486
01:48:49,369 --> 01:48:52,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">my work's done here. I'm going home.</font>

1487
01:49:00,699 --> 01:49:02,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have attachments.</font>

1488
01:49:02,529 --> 01:49:05,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">But even without a family,
I can promise you that</font>

1489
01:49:05,930 --> 01:49:09,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">that yearning to be with other people
is powerful.</font>

1490
01:49:09,729 --> 01:49:15,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">That emotion is at the foundation
of what makes us human.</font>

1491
01:49:15,329 --> 01:49:17,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not to be taken lightly.</font>

1492
01:49:24,829 --> 01:49:27,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How long have you had that cough?
- A while.</font>

1493
01:49:37,970 --> 01:49:40,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mom lets me play in here.</font>

1494
01:49:41,399 --> 01:49:43,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't touch your stuff.</font>

1495
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:15,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just take this gently.</font>

1496
01:50:20,829 --> 01:50:24,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know why we couldn't just send machines
on these missions, don't you, Cooper?</font>

1497
01:50:24,829 --> 01:50:26,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">A machine doesn't improvise well...</font>

1498
01:50:26,930 --> 01:50:29,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">because you can't program
a fear of death.</font>

1499
01:50:30,329 --> 01:50:34,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our survival instinct
is our single greatest source of inspiration.</font>

1500
01:50:34,670 --> 01:50:36,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take you, for example.</font>

1501
01:50:37,039 --> 01:50:39,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">A father...</font>

1502
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:42,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">with a survival instinct
that extends to your kids.</font>

1503
01:50:43,039 --> 01:50:44,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">What does research tell us..</font>

1504
01:50:44,829 --> 01:50:48,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is the last thing you're gonna see
before you die?</font>

1505
01:50:49,470 --> 01:50:52,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your children.
Their faces.</font>

1506
01:50:52,460 --> 01:50:53,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">At the moment of death,</font>

1507
01:50:53,869 --> 01:50:56,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">your mind's gonna push
a little bit harder to survive.</font>

1508
01:50:57,369 --> 01:50:58,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">For them.</font>

1509
01:50:59,300 --> 01:51:00,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Deep breath.</font>

1510
01:51:02,869 --> 01:51:04,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey. I bet you're Coop.</font>

1511
01:51:04,369 --> 01:51:06,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you
have a seat here for me?</font>

1512
01:51:06,899 --> 01:51:09,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's bad.
They cannot stay here.</font>

1513
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:11,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay?
- Yeah.</font>

1514
01:51:19,500 --> 01:51:20,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">what's taking so long?</font>

1515
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:24,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor, I am having trouble
completing the boot up.</font>

1516
01:51:24,199 --> 01:51:25,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't understand.</font>

1517
01:51:32,600 --> 01:51:34,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's funny.</font>

1518
01:51:35,930 --> 01:51:37,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I left Earth...</font>

1519
01:51:38,500 --> 01:51:41,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought I was prepared to die.</font>

1520
01:51:42,670 --> 01:51:44,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">The truth is...</font>

1521
01:51:46,170 --> 01:51:51,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never really considered the possibility
that my planet wasn't the one.</font>

1522
01:51:53,899 --> 01:51:56,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing worked out the way
it was supposed to.</font>

1523
01:51:56,329 --> 01:51:57,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go.</font>

1524
01:52:05,829 --> 01:52:07,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. Here, buddy,
why don't you give me..</font>

1525
01:52:07,500 --> 01:52:09,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">A big deep breath.</font>

1526
01:52:13,569 --> 01:52:15,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is this?</font>

1527
01:52:15,229 --> 01:52:17,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry!</font>

1528
01:52:17,399 --> 01:52:19,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't
let you leave with that ship.</font>

1529
01:52:19,369 --> 01:52:22,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna need it
to complete the mission...</font>

1530
01:52:22,100 --> 01:52:25,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">once the others realize
what this place isn't.</font>

1531
01:52:25,800 --> 01:52:28,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">We cannot
survive here. I'm sorry!</font>

1532
01:52:29,029 --> 01:52:30,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry!</font>

1533
01:52:39,930 --> 01:52:41,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">They can't stay here anymore.</font>

1534
01:52:41,199 --> 01:52:43,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have to leave right now.</font>

1535
01:52:43,170 --> 01:52:45,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, let me.. Let me
make something abundantly clear:</font>

1536
01:52:45,229 --> 01:52:47,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You have a responsibility...
- Jesus!</font>

1537
01:52:47,899 --> 01:52:50,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Coop, get her stuff.
She's going home.</font>

1538
01:52:50,430 --> 01:52:52,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dad didn't raise you
to be this dumb, Tom!</font>

1539
01:52:52,500 --> 01:52:54,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dad didn't raise me,
Grandpa did.</font>

1540
01:52:54,130 --> 01:52:56,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he's buried out back
with Mom and Jesse.</font>

1541
01:52:57,130 --> 01:52:59,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">You faked all the data?</font>

1542
01:53:01,500 --> 01:53:02,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

1543
01:53:06,729 --> 01:53:09,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">- There's no surface?
- No.</font>

1544
01:53:10,600 --> 01:53:12,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">I tried to do my duty, Cooper...</font>

1545
01:53:12,750 --> 01:53:18,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I knew the day that I arrived here
that this place had nothing.</font>

1546
01:53:18,369 --> 01:53:22,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I resisted the temptation for years...</font>

1547
01:53:22,899 --> 01:53:28,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I knew that if I just pressed
that button,</font>

1548
01:53:28,500 --> 01:53:30,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">then somebody would come
and save me.</font>

1549
01:53:31,470 --> 01:53:34,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You fucking coward.
- Yes.</font>

1550
01:53:40,279 --> 01:53:41,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

1551
01:53:43,199 --> 01:53:44,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

1552
01:53:45,399 --> 01:53:46,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

1553
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, if you're not going to go,
let your family go.</font>

1554
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:02,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just save your family.</font>

1555
01:54:03,130 --> 01:54:05,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we go
live underground with you?</font>

1556
01:54:05,600 --> 01:54:08,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Pray that Daddy comes to save us?
- Dad's not coming back.</font>

1557
01:54:08,829 --> 01:54:10,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">He never was coming back.</font>

1558
01:54:10,729 --> 01:54:13,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's up to me.
- You're gonna save everybody?</font>

1559
01:54:13,500 --> 01:54:16,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Because Dad couldn't do it.
- Dad didn't even try!</font>

1560
01:54:16,569 --> 01:54:18,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dad just abandoned us!</font>

1561
01:54:19,430 --> 01:54:23,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He left us here to die.
- Nobody's going with you.</font>

1562
01:54:27,399 --> 01:54:30,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">You gonna wait
for your next kid to die?</font>

1563
01:54:32,869 --> 01:54:34,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out.</font>

1564
01:54:35,229 --> 01:54:36,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">And don't come back.</font>

1565
01:54:41,470 --> 01:54:43,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can keep my stuff.</font>

1566
01:54:54,300 --> 01:54:55,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop it!</font>

1567
01:54:58,500 --> 01:55:00,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No!</font>

1568
01:55:01,100 --> 01:55:04,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dr. Mann, there's a 50-50 chance
you're gonna kill yourself!</font>

1569
01:55:05,170 --> 01:55:07,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those are the best odds
I've had in years.</font>

1570
01:55:27,399 --> 01:55:29,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't judge me, Cooper.</font>

1571
01:55:30,039 --> 01:55:32,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were never tested like I was.</font>

1572
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:34,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Few men have been.</font>

1573
01:55:42,770 --> 01:55:44,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">You tried your best, Murph.</font>

1574
01:55:53,470 --> 01:55:56,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're feeling it, aren't you?</font>

1575
01:55:56,300 --> 01:55:58,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">The survival instinct.</font>

1576
01:55:59,100 --> 01:56:02,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what drove me.
It's what drives all of us.</font>

1577
01:56:02,100 --> 01:56:03,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it's what's gonna save us.</font>

1578
01:56:04,600 --> 01:56:08,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I want to save all of us.
For you, Cooper.</font>

1579
01:56:13,199 --> 01:56:14,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, I can't...</font>

1580
01:56:14,670 --> 01:56:16,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't watch you go through this.
I'm sorry.</font>

1581

I'm here for you.</font>

tell you that poem before you left?</font>
