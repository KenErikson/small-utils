00:18:02,227 --> 00:18:03,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah?</font>

153
00:18:03,361 --> 00:18:05,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">I take it
he's a bad guy.</font>

154
00:18:05,262 --> 00:18:06,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">You mean the guy
with the black body armor,</font>

155
00:18:06,932 --> 00:18:09,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">shotgun, and gas mask?</font>

156
00:18:09,067 --> 00:18:11,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's very funny.
We know who he is yet?</font>

157
00:18:11,703 --> 00:18:12,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rough night?</font>

158
00:18:13,271 --> 00:18:15,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. Next subject?</font>

159
00:18:15,373 --> 00:18:17,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not looking
so hot there, bubba.</font>

160
00:18:17,076 --> 00:18:19,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think
he looks amazing.</font>

161
00:18:19,044 --> 00:18:22,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've got enough toxins in me to turn the
Gaza Strip into a Gay Pride parade.</font>

162
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:26,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">You better start downing the POM juice,
big man. We've got a piss test Friday.</font>

163
00:18:26,218 --> 00:18:28,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thursday.</font>

164
00:18:28,053 --> 00:18:30,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, like you Mormons have been
drinking wheatgrass all fucking month?</font>

165
00:18:30,088 --> 00:18:31,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please.</font>

166
00:18:31,557 --> 00:18:33,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got another one of those?
I'm fucking starving.</font>

167
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:34,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, there's a
couple that don't have blood.</font>

168
00:18:34,593 --> 00:18:37,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think it's one of the
pinkies with the sprinkles.</font>

169
00:18:39,397 --> 00:18:41,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's some real donut.</font>

170
00:18:41,733 --> 00:18:43,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those are horrendous, dude.</font>

171
00:18:43,568 --> 00:18:46,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey. You guys push
back the perimeter.</font>

172
00:18:46,605 --> 00:18:49,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Need to extend the crime scene, okay?
Too goddamn small.</font>

173
00:18:49,442 --> 00:18:51,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got it.
What's the tally?</font>

174
00:18:51,576 --> 00:18:54,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've got four dead, six on
the way to the hospital.</font>

175
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But they'll be all right.
- Fuck.</font>

176
00:18:55,914 --> 00:18:58,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ambushed them as they
were coming to get breakfast.</font>

177
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:00,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">Surrounded the truck.</font>

178
00:19:00,318 --> 00:19:03,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">This poor fool right here was trying
to do what he gets paid to do.</font>

179
00:19:03,088 --> 00:19:06,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">AP rounds blasted through the
windshield took him out.</font>

180
00:19:06,424 --> 00:19:10,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">They took the truck, Gardena police
lost them under Hawthorne Municipal.</font>

181
00:19:10,262 --> 00:19:11,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">They knew the route.</font>

182
00:19:11,596 --> 00:19:14,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">Picked it because it was
next to Municipal Airport,</font>

183
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">knew the restricted air space
meant no ghetto bird air support.</font>

184
00:19:19,771 --> 00:19:22,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're dealing with a different
animal here, boys.</font>

185
00:19:22,974 --> 00:19:25,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">Talk to the armored car company?
What was the haul?</font>

186
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:27,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">They were en route to a bank
pickup for a Fed drop.</font>

187
00:19:27,945 --> 00:19:28,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">But there was nothing
in the truck.</font>

188
00:19:29,781 --> 00:19:30,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing in the truck?</font>

189
00:19:33,318 --> 00:19:34,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">They stole a fucking empty
armored truck?</font>

190
00:19:35,288 --> 00:19:36,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yup.</font>

191
00:19:38,356 --> 00:19:40,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why the fireworks?</font>

192
00:19:40,358 --> 00:19:43,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">One of the vics said the messenger went
for his gun. That's when it popped off.</font>

193
00:19:44,462 --> 00:19:45,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">Genius.</font>

194
00:19:45,697 --> 00:19:47,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, the SUV,
what have we got?</font>

195
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:49,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a cold car.</font>

196
00:19:49,868 --> 00:19:54,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">VIN's been pried off. Plates are stolen.
No prints on it. They bleach-bombed it.</font>

197
00:19:54,173 --> 00:19:59,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right. Take it to SID. Tent that fucker.
Swab it. Detail it.</font>

198
00:20:08,053 --> 00:20:11,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck. I can't deal with this
retard factory this early.</font>

199
00:20:11,356 --> 00:20:12,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">One of you guys handle it?</font>

200
00:20:13,157 --> 00:20:14,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all you, bro.</font>

201
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:17,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

202
00:20:17,329 --> 00:20:19,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, witnesses,
donut shop guy?</font>

203
00:20:19,865 --> 00:20:21,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">He saw them, and they
looked right at him,</font>

204
00:20:21,532 --> 00:20:23,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">but, for some reason,
they left him alone.</font>

205
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:30,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, pull all video surveillance and
plate readers. Do a Palantir run.</font>

206
00:20:30,009 --> 00:20:31,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Talk to DOT, okay?</font>

207
00:20:31,343 --> 00:20:34,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pull it all together,
and meet me at the office.</font>

208
00:20:34,546 --> 00:20:36,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">And find me
that fucking truck.</font>

209
00:20:40,019 --> 00:20:44,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Big Nick, original gangsta
cop in the flesh.</font>

210
00:20:44,356 --> 00:20:46,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lobbin' Bob. Huh?</font>

211
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:48,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">How's that
mean tennis game?</font>

212
00:20:53,732 --> 00:20:55,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at you, man.</font>

213
00:20:55,267 --> 00:20:57,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where'd you pick that up?
Nice suit.</font>

214
00:20:57,102 --> 00:21:00,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, not where you're shopping.
I can't afford it.</font>

215
00:21:00,538 --> 00:21:03,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean,
how does a county sheriff</font>

216
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:05,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">pay for such a beautiful
piece of men's fashion?</font>

217
00:21:05,609 --> 00:21:09,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">You kidding me? This piece of shit?
Nah, this is garbage. Look at you.</font>

218
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">This thing's tits!</font>

219
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:14,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must pull all kinds
of ass sporting that, no?</font>

220
00:21:14,719 --> 00:21:16,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nick, you know what?
I can't. I can't.</font>

221
00:21:16,755 --> 00:21:20,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's too early in the morning
for your fucking circus.</font>

222
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:22,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just threw a donut
in the hot zone.</font>

223
00:21:22,794 --> 00:21:24,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No. I did not.
- Yeah, you did.</font>

224
00:21:24,596 --> 00:21:26,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did?
That was fucking wrong.</font>

225
00:21:26,631 --> 00:21:28,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was. I don't like you, Nick, or
how you handle police business...</font>

226
00:21:28,967 --> 00:21:30,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's up with that?</font>

227
00:21:31,603 --> 00:21:33,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like you.</font>

228
00:21:33,137 --> 00:21:35,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aside from the fact
that you're a vegetarian.</font>

229
00:21:35,272 --> 00:21:37,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">Vegan! I'm a vegan.</font>

230
00:21:37,909 --> 00:21:39,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Vegetarians, they eat milk...
- Yeah, sorry to hear that.</font>

231
00:21:39,944 --> 00:21:42,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you
doing here anyway, huh?</font>

232
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:45,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">No legal tender was stolen.
It isn't Federal.</font>

233
00:21:46,917 --> 00:21:48,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yet.</font>

234
00:21:50,121 --> 00:21:51,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're pausing
for dramatic effect?</font>

235
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:58,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're such a big,
bad lieutenant.</font>

236
00:21:58,163 --> 00:22:00,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I know. I know.
- Yeah.</font>

237
00:22:00,298 --> 00:22:03,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I go now, Dad?
I'm kind of hungry.</font>

238
00:22:10,141 --> 00:22:12,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">So Gardena showed up,
and they secured the scene,</font>

239
00:22:12,609 --> 00:22:15,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then these clowns
took over.</font>

240
00:22:15,647 --> 00:22:17,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are they, LASD?</font>

241
00:22:17,281 --> 00:22:20,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, Sheriff's. They must be.
Look at this clown right here.</font>

242
00:22:20,185 --> 00:22:21,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">He seemed to be in charge.</font>

243
00:22:36,468 --> 00:22:38,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">You recognize him?</font>

244
00:22:38,471 --> 00:22:40,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">He played football
at South.</font>

245
00:22:40,637 --> 00:22:43,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember Endo?
Filipino dude the cops killed?</font>

246
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:45,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

247
00:22:45,343 --> 00:22:47,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the cop
who blasted him.</font>

248
00:22:47,346 --> 00:22:49,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">Runs Major Crimes.</font>

249
00:22:49,314 --> 00:22:51,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get to know your enemy, boys.</font>

250
00:23:00,492 --> 00:23:02,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's running this crew?</font>

251
00:23:02,861 --> 00:23:05,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">Probably two, three guys
that can pull this off, max.</font>

252
00:23:05,497 --> 00:23:10,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why steal an armored truck
with nothing in it?</font>

253
00:23:10,502 --> 00:23:12,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bad tip,
they probably botched it.</font>

254
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:14,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why didn't they
dump it, then?</font>

255
00:23:14,005 --> 00:23:16,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'll take the salvage yards.
All of them.</font>

256
00:23:16,207 --> 00:23:20,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">And how'd they know about a transfer
from the casino to the Fed,</font>

257
00:23:20,512 --> 00:23:24,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">especially one that wasn't scheduled
through the regular carrier? How?</font>

258
00:23:24,884 --> 00:23:27,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was an inside job, bro.
It had to be.</font>

259
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:30,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, fuck.
Give me the Pepto.</font>

260
00:23:30,355 --> 00:23:33,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, inside job, but where?</font>

261
00:23:33,023 --> 00:23:36,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right? Was it the casino, the bank, the
Fed, the fucking donut shop? Where?</font>

262
00:23:38,029 --> 00:23:39,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about Merrimen?</font>

263
00:23:42,867 --> 00:23:44,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">When did he parole again?</font>

264
00:23:44,536 --> 00:23:47,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Eight months ago.
- Eight months ago?</font>

265
00:23:48,906 --> 00:23:51,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to find
that fucking truck.</font>

266
00:23:51,776 --> 00:23:53,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have we still got a tail
on that Wilson kid?</font>

267
00:23:53,913 --> 00:23:56,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah.
The one who was hanging out with Merrimen?</font>

268
00:23:56,247 --> 00:23:57,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">What bar did he work in?</font>

269
00:23:57,882 --> 00:24:00,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hofbrau.
- Ziggy's Hofbrau.</font>

270
00:24:00,785 --> 00:24:02,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's pay him a visit.</font>

271
00:24:12,564 --> 00:24:15,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">some Wi-Fi? No?
We better check his videos.</font>

272
00:24:18,736 --> 00:24:19,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thanks.
- All right.</font>

273
00:24:20,605 --> 00:24:22,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wolfgang, talk to me.</font>

274
00:24:22,574 --> 00:24:24,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Donnie, I'm tapped out.
- No problem.</font>

275
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:26,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put it on my tab, all right?</font>

276
00:24:26,243 --> 00:24:27,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Of course, man, I got you.
- Thank you.</font>

277
00:24:27,779 --> 00:24:28,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have a good night.</font>

278
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:42,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are we doing this?</font>

279
00:24:42,292 --> 00:24:43,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, man. All right, man.</font>

280
00:24:44,762 --> 00:24:46,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">To money and women.</font>

281
00:24:46,763 --> 00:24:47,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">That we don't have.</font>

282
00:24:51,435 --> 00:24:53,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you remember
everybody's order like that?</font>

283
00:24:53,771 --> 00:24:56,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't remember
the last four of my social.</font>

284
00:24:56,273 --> 00:24:58,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lots of reps, man.</font>

285
00:24:58,009 --> 00:25:00,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm in complete control of my environment.
People don't even know.</font>

286
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:04,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, man, time to go.
- Okay.</font>

287
00:25:04,817 --> 00:25:06,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wrap it up.</font>

288
00:25:06,951 --> 00:25:09,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Just a little bit.
Yeah, yeah.</font>

289
00:25:09,153 --> 00:25:11,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ziggy's going to kill me.
- Shit, not going to finish.</font>

290
00:25:13,458 --> 00:25:14,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">A gift.</font>

291
00:25:15,193 --> 00:25:16,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">How about a tip?</font>

292
00:25:16,493 --> 00:25:18,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got you last time.</font>

293
00:25:18,128 --> 00:25:19,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah, you got me last...</font>

294
00:25:19,798 --> 00:25:21,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not how it works.</font>

295
00:25:24,669 --> 00:25:27,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, really? Zoo animals.</font>

296
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">Need change?</font>

297
00:25:35,847 --> 00:25:37,317

- Excuse me.</font>

You're a two-striker.</font>

370

me when I'm talking to you.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">What you think?
How you feel about that?</font>

375
00:31:11,214 --> 00:31:14,317

is not even a regular at my bar.</font>

376

you know, I don't associate myself...</font>

377
00:31:25,695 --> 00:31:27,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know what this means?</font>

378
00:31:28,866 --> 00:31:31,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">It means I am
a member of a clique.</font>

379
00:31:31,502 --> 00:31:33,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's kind of like
being in a gang.</font>

380
00:31:33,503 --> 00:31:37,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sort of like a gang,
only we have badges,</font>

381
00:31:37,074 --> 00:31:40,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">which means you are done.</font>

383
00:31:47,885 --> 00:31:49,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me ask you this.</font>

384
00:31:49,353 --> 00:31:52,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, do we look like
the types who will arrest you?</font>

385
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:55,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put you in handcuffs,
drag you down to the station?</font>

386
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm?</font>

387
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:59,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm asking you
a fucking question.</font>

388
00:31:59,932 --> 00:32:02,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Not at all.</font>

389
00:32:02,032 --> 00:32:04,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right, exactly.</font>

390
00:32:04,568 --> 00:32:07,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">We just shoot you.
It's less paperwork.</font>

391
00:32:10,241 --> 00:32:11,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">So tell me,</font>

392
00:32:14,744 --> 00:32:17,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">what the fuck are you doing
hanging out in that crew?</font>

393
00:32:17,548 --> 00:32:19,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm?</font>

394
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:20,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a pussy.</font>

395
00:32:20,584 --> 00:32:22,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those dudes are bad dudes.</font>

396
00:32:22,788 --> 00:32:26,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great thieves
but straight convicts.</font>

397
00:32:26,891 --> 00:32:29,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's Merrimen doing drinking
beers with the likes of you for?</font>

398
00:32:29,794 --> 00:32:31,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Talk shop?</font>

399
00:32:31,395 --> 00:32:33,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">You gonna hit
the fucking Hofbrau?</font>

400
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:36,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take the place down, score, like,
what, two grand in ones and fives?</font>

401
00:32:36,067 --> 00:32:37,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that what's afoot?
I'll answer that for you.</font>

402
00:32:37,435 --> 00:32:39,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it fucking isn't.</font>

403
00:32:41,238 --> 00:32:43,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know what crew
you're speaking about, man.</font>

404
00:32:43,574 --> 00:32:45,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">This dude just comes
to my bar where I work...</font>

405
00:32:45,443 --> 00:32:48,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop. Shut up.</font>

406
00:32:55,786 --> 00:32:57,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, man. This is some weird shit.
Just...</font>

407
00:32:57,923 --> 00:33:00,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">You listen to me, fuckface.</font>

408
00:33:00,424 --> 00:33:02,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't give
a shit about you.</font>

409
00:33:04,962 --> 00:33:06,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">You in Merrimen's crew?</font>

410
00:33:06,664 --> 00:33:07,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm?</font>

411
00:33:08,632 --> 00:33:10,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh? You hit the stadium?</font>

412
00:33:12,502 --> 00:33:14,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">You talky-talky now?</font>

413
00:33:14,305 --> 00:33:15,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, please.</font>

414
00:33:21,811 --> 00:33:22,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck!</font>

415
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:32,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just the driver!</font>

416
00:33:32,323 --> 00:33:34,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just the driver!</font>

417
00:33:34,959 --> 00:33:37,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">They don't give me no gun.
I don't do no gangster shit.</font>

418
00:33:37,695 --> 00:33:40,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">They asked me to drive,
so that's what I do.</font>

419
00:33:40,131 --> 00:33:42,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's it. Fuck!</font>

420
00:33:42,666 --> 00:33:45,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why did Merrimen hijack
an empty armored car?</font>

421
00:33:45,636 --> 00:33:47,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know, all right?</font>

422
00:33:47,171 --> 00:33:49,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">They keep me in the dark
for shit like this.</font>

423
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">If the cops come down on me,</font>

424
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:52,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't tell them shit
if I don't know shit.</font>

425
00:33:52,343 --> 00:33:54,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now y'all can hook me up
to a lie detector,</font>

426
00:33:54,677 --> 00:33:56,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">a fucking polygraph,
whatever y'all got.</font>

427
00:33:56,981 --> 00:33:59,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm telling you what I know,
and that's all you'll get.</font>

428
00:33:59,983 --> 00:34:01,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, just let me
the fuck go.</font>

429
00:34:04,055 --> 00:34:07,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck y'all, man.
Let me go.</font>

430
00:34:09,025 --> 00:34:11,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I thought that was
relatively convincing.</font>

431
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good stuff.</font>

432
00:34:15,367 --> 00:34:16,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right,
when did you meet him?</font>

433
00:34:17,534 --> 00:34:19,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do I get out of this?</font>

434
00:34:19,204 --> 00:34:23,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you get out of this?
Well, your freedom for one.</font>

435
00:34:24,576 --> 00:34:26,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two,</font>

436
00:34:28,512 --> 00:34:29,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're not the bad guys.</font>

437
00:34:30,715 --> 00:34:31,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are.</font>

438
00:34:37,521 --> 00:34:40,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">Couple months ago,
they came through the bar,</font>

439
00:34:40,724 --> 00:34:43,057
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>and I served them
a few drinks.</i></font>

440
00:34:43,059 --> 00:34:45,027
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>We started talking.</i></font>

441
00:34:45,028 --> 00:34:46,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Donnie, come here, man.</font>

442
00:34:50,235 --> 00:34:52,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is my boy, Bosco.</font>

443
00:34:52,068 --> 00:34:54,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">My brother for life.
We deployed together.</font>

444
00:34:56,039 --> 00:34:57,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, the kid can drive.</font>

445
00:34:59,376 --> 00:35:01,076

00:46:55,125 --> 00:46:57,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Bosco,
the Peckerwood?</font>

594
00:46:57,427 --> 00:47:00,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a Huntington Beach kid,
also MARSOC Marines.</font>

595
00:47:00,597 --> 00:47:03,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">He did comms with them.
He had a solid career.</font>

596
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:05,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">But he didn't serve together
with the other guys.</font>

597
00:47:05,434 --> 00:47:08,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was the Wood Rep at Victorville
when Merrimen was there.</font>

598
00:47:08,105 --> 00:47:10,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's where they linked up.</font>

599
00:47:10,106 --> 00:47:13,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Donnie was a Marine for a
year and a half, then discharge.</font>

600
00:47:13,809 --> 00:47:15,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, the way I see it,</font>

601
00:47:15,512 --> 00:47:17,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">that's the way all these niggas
ended up working together.</font>

602
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's only two passports on the
streets, sports and military.</font>

603
00:47:20,483 --> 00:47:23,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every time the Fed receives
a deposit from a bank,</font>

604
00:47:23,153 --> 00:47:26,487
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>first thing they do is send that
money up to the count rooms.</i></font>

605
00:47:26,489 --> 00:47:28,489
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>They run the notes
through the counting machines.</i></font>

606
00:47:28,490 --> 00:47:30,291
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>They're accomplishing
two things here.</i></font>

607
00:47:30,293 --> 00:47:32,827
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>First, they're double-checking the
accuracy of the bank's deposit.</i></font>

608
00:47:32,829 --> 00:47:34,362
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>If the bank is off at all,</i></font>

609
00:47:34,364 --> 00:47:36,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">they're going to credit or
debit the account accordingly.</font>

610
00:47:36,166 --> 00:47:42,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two, they're separating newer, fit
currency from old unfit bills.</font>

611
00:47:42,005 --> 00:47:44,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">But most importantly, they're
erasing the serial numbers</font>

612
00:47:44,641 --> 00:47:46,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">of the old bills
from the Fed system.</font>

613
00:47:46,978 --> 00:47:50,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once those numbers are erased, to
the Fed, to the rest of the world,</font>

614
00:47:50,847 --> 00:47:53,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">that money
has ceased to exist.</font>

615
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:54,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, let's look at
the unsolved cases.</font>

616
00:47:54,885 --> 00:47:59,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">In '04, you have the Boller
National Bank Hollywood job, okay?</font>

617
00:47:59,155 --> 00:48:00,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">They tunneled through
the sewer system.</font>

618
00:48:00,824 --> 00:48:04,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sophisticated, skill set,
someone with access, unsolved.</font>

619
00:48:04,894 --> 00:48:08,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, in '05, you have the
Fuerte armored car depot job.</font>

620
00:48:08,565 --> 00:48:10,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blew the depot vault
with shaped charges.</font>

621
00:48:10,668 --> 00:48:12,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the $100 count room alone,</font>

622
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:17,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">an average of $30 million is
designated as unfit every day.</font>

623
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:18,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Between 4:00 p.m.
and 5:00 p.m.,</font>

624
00:48:18,842 --> 00:48:21,844
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>all the cash gets shot out
to the shredder.</i></font>

625
00:48:21,846 --> 00:48:23,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all destroyed.</font>

626
00:48:24,382 --> 00:48:30,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">$30 million
turned to dust in seconds.</font>

627
00:48:30,253 --> 00:48:32,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's then picked up by the
Fed's waste management company</font>

628
00:48:32,556 --> 00:48:33,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">and brought out to the dump.</font>

629
00:48:35,592 --> 00:48:37,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we can get
to those unfit bills</font>

630
00:48:37,594 --> 00:48:40,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">before they go to the shredders
and get out clean...</font>

631
00:48:40,896 --> 00:48:43,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got $30 million
nobody is looking for.</font>

632
00:48:43,701 --> 00:48:44,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bingo.</font>

633
00:48:44,768 --> 00:48:47,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">In '06,
you have Laguna Niguel.</font>

634
00:48:47,237 --> 00:48:50,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Same thing, only this time, Merrimen
gets unlucky with the tail-light.</font>

635
00:48:50,907 --> 00:48:55,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goes to prison till 2016. Now, in
that time, while he was in prison,</font>

636
00:48:55,913 --> 00:48:59,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">how many highly sophisticated,
well-executed heists do we have?</font>

637
00:48:59,048 --> 00:49:00,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">None, but you're on a roll.
Keep going.</font>

638
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:04,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">The counter guy at the donut shop?
Witness to the whole thing.</font>

639
00:49:04,721 --> 00:49:05,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">They left him. Why?</font>

640
00:49:08,625 --> 00:49:12,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because they shoot uniforms,
not unarmed civilians.</font>

641
00:49:12,228 --> 00:49:13,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">Exactly what
they were trained to do.</font>

642
00:49:15,097 --> 00:49:16,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gangbangers, these are not.</font>

643
00:49:17,467 --> 00:49:21,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, these are our guys.</font>

644
00:49:21,972 --> 00:49:25,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">We nail these guys,
we solve all these cases.</font>

645
00:49:26,742 --> 00:49:28,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the crew.</font>

646
00:49:30,815 --> 00:49:33,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">You still haven't told us how
you can get past that security.</font>

647
00:49:35,152 --> 00:49:36,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not
going in this way.</font>

648
00:49:39,623 --> 00:49:41,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're going in that way.</font>

649
00:49:51,134 --> 00:49:52,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's going on
with <i>Fraulein?</i></font>

650
00:49:52,635 --> 00:49:54,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can move on him
anytime we want.</font>

651
00:49:56,606 --> 00:49:59,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I pay minimum wage.
- Okay.</font>

652
00:49:59,009 --> 00:50:02,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">Plus $3 for delivery.
And you split the tip with me.</font>

653
00:50:02,144 --> 00:50:04,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">You start Wednesday, 11:00.</font>

654
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:05,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

655
00:50:05,949 --> 00:50:07,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't really like the
food there, but I'm down to go,</font>

656
00:50:07,985 --> 00:50:10,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">- but you've got to pay this time.
I'm not paying it.</font>

657
00:50:10,121 --> 00:50:11,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

658
00:50:11,521 --> 00:50:14,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I pay every fucking time.
What?</font>

659
00:50:14,190 --> 00:50:15,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get off
your wallet, buddy.</font>

660
00:50:15,525 --> 00:50:17,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I forgot my wallet today,
boys. I'm sorry.</font>

661
00:50:17,193 --> 00:50:18,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Again?
- Yeah, again.</font>

662
00:50:18,996 --> 00:50:20,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got an alligator arm.</font>

663
00:50:20,364 --> 00:50:23,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">I sat down at blackjack
with $5, and I made $160.</font>

664
00:50:23,634 --> 00:50:25,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nicholas O'Brien?</font>

665
00:50:26,836 --> 00:50:28,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah?</font>

666
00:50:28,304 --> 00:50:30,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">I suggest you take these.</font>

667
00:50:31,641 --> 00:50:32,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're being served.</font>

668
00:50:34,010 --> 00:50:35,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">You kidding me?</font>

669
00:50:35,346 --> 00:50:36,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm afraid not.</font>

670
00:50:38,882 --> 00:50:39,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's going on?</font>

671
00:50:41,152 --> 00:50:43,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">You all right, bro?</font>

672
00:50:43,186 --> 00:50:44,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I guess
I'm getting divorced.</font>

673
00:50:45,855 --> 00:50:47,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">He say "divorced"?</font>

674
00:50:49,059 --> 00:50:50,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yo.</font>

675
00:50:52,028 --> 00:50:54,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome to the fucking club.</font>

676
00:50:54,030 --> 00:50:55,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, go handle your business,
big man.</font>

677
00:51:04,407 --> 00:51:05,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gas the jet.</font>

678
00:51:09,711 --> 00:51:10,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck.</font>

679
00:51:47,284 --> 00:51:49,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a closer view.</font>

680
00:51:49,952 --> 00:51:52,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">There was a rolling blackout in
this quadrant four days ago.</font>

681
00:51:52,588 --> 00:51:54,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, they've been happening a
lot over the last few months.</font>

682
00:51:54,557 --> 00:51:56,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

683
00:51:56,226 --> 00:51:58,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">They say they have full backup
power, but actually they don't.</font>

684
00:51:58,628 --> 00:52:01,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">- They go into brown-out.
- Yeah, prioritize the grid.</font>

685
00:52:01,898 --> 00:52:04,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">Priority, of course, is the vault.
So everything in there stays intact.</font>

686
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:07,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">But anything that is peripheral,
like cameras in the hallway,</font>

687
00:52:07,637 --> 00:52:10,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">shredders in the count rooms,
everything else cuts out.</font>

688
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:14,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">To time it during another rolling blackout
is going to be fucking impossible.</font>

689
00:52:14,277 --> 00:52:17,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So you want to simulate it?
Can we?</font>

690
00:52:17,081 --> 00:52:19,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">Break in, have them go brown
for about two minutes.</font>

691
00:52:19,115 --> 00:52:22,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd say yes, but I'd like to
have data to be sure.</font>

692
00:52:22,286 --> 00:52:23,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great.</font>

693
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:26,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once we breach the count room,
only thing left is the cameras.</font>

694
00:52:26,289 --> 00:52:28,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">They run on their own
power supply,</font>

695
00:52:28,125 --> 00:52:30,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">so they're unaffected
by the brown-out.</font>

696
00:52:30,661 --> 00:52:34,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">The solve here is we run
an EMP burst.</font>

697
00:52:34,297 --> 00:52:37,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should take out the cameras
and motion for about 30 feet.</font>

698
00:52:37,768 --> 00:52:39,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where you get all this
information from?</font>

699
00:52:41,605 --> 00:52:43,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have to
worry about that.</font>

700
00:52:43,773 --> 00:52:45,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just trust me
when I say it's solid.</font>

701
00:52:47,143 --> 00:52:48,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">How we doing
with the Telecal hook?</font>

702
00:52:48,945 --> 00:52:51,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Couple days.
Shouldn't be a problem.</font>

703

- Mmm-hmm. That's me.</font>

715
00:54:26,742 --> 00:54:29,244

- Good. How you are doing today?</font>

716
00:54:29,246 --> 00:54:32,413

- Thank you.</font>

718
00:54:33,916 --> 00:54:36,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut up. Really?</font>

719
00:54:36,385 --> 00:54:38,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Y'all have a good day.
I'm gonna stay out of it.</font>

720
00:54:38,721 --> 00:54:40,922

- You have a wonderful day.</font>

721
00:54:40,923 --> 00:54:44,293

Lunch. Desert.</font>

722
00:54:44,295 --> 00:54:45,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bye, sunshine.</font>

723
00:55:17,594 --> 00:55:18,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">There he goes.</font>

724
00:55:27,471 --> 00:55:29,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fed's got 82.</font>

725
00:55:29,105 --> 00:55:30,940

- Or not.</font>

taking the cash</font>

735
00:55:53,663 --> 00:55:57,164

really there for something else?</font>

736
00:55:57,166 --> 00:56:00,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then they take down an armored
car that's empty. Come on, guys.</font>

737
00:56:00,471 --> 00:56:02,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, remember
what Donnie said.</font>

738
00:56:02,806 --> 00:56:04,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's trading up.
They're going big.</font>

739
00:56:04,507 --> 00:56:06,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Nick, you can't
take down the Fed, man.</font>

740
00:56:06,976 --> 00:56:09,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, Merrimen's no dummy.
It's impossible.</font>

741
00:56:09,313 --> 00:56:13,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Fed is the Olympics, and
Merrimen is Carl fucking Lewis.</font>

742
00:56:14,182 --> 00:56:15,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm telling you,</font>

743
00:56:15,853 --> 00:56:17,521
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Fraulein's</i> holding out on us.</font>

744
00:56:23,159 --> 00:56:25,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">My gosh.</font>

745
00:56:25,327 --> 00:56:26,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Aw!</font>

746
00:56:36,838 --> 00:56:37,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, he's here.
- Okay.</font>

747
00:56:46,182 --> 00:56:48,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn, girl looking fine.</font>

748
00:56:48,885 --> 00:56:51,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.
You look amazing.</font>

749
00:56:51,387 --> 00:56:53,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">How are you?</font>

750
00:56:53,556 --> 00:56:55,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looking good.
Thank you.</font>

751
00:56:55,391 --> 00:56:57,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This is my mom. This is Rolando.
- Hi.</font>

752
00:56:57,427 --> 00:56:59,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Nice to meet you. Rolando.
- Hi, I'm Malia. Nice to meet you.</font>

753
00:56:59,563 --> 00:57:02,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I see where you get your looks from.
- Thank you.</font>

754
00:57:04,902 --> 00:57:06,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

755
00:57:06,068 --> 00:57:08,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Can I take that?
- Oh, yeah, sure.</font>

756
00:57:08,572 --> 00:57:12,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, Rolando,
this is my dad.</font>

757
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:15,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's up, Mr. Levoux?
Nice to meet you.</font>

758
00:57:18,382 --> 00:57:20,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me holler at him
for a second.</font>

759
00:57:22,952 --> 00:57:24,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me talk to you, bruh.</font>

760
00:57:32,461 --> 00:57:35,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">Honey, don't worry about it.
Okay? They're just gonna talk.</font>

761
00:57:43,739 --> 00:57:45,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">So here's what's up.</font>

762
00:57:45,409 --> 00:57:47,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">For the past 16 years,</font>

763
00:57:47,309 --> 00:57:49,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">my daughter's safety and protection
has been my responsibility</font>

764
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:52,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">and my responsibility only.</font>

765
00:57:52,248 --> 00:57:56,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, for the first time in her life, I see
I've got to hand you that responsibility.</font>

766
00:57:57,586 --> 00:57:58,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't fuck up,</font>

767
00:57:58,922 --> 00:58:00,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">or your mama
will weep as she has</font>

768
00:58:00,590 --> 00:58:03,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">to wheel your ass around every
day the rest of your life.</font>

769
00:58:06,295 --> 00:58:10,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now I worked on this, because I want to
say this to you as nice as possible.</font>

770
00:58:10,298 --> 00:58:11,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you understand?</font>

771
00:58:11,802 --> 00:58:14,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Yes, sir.</font>

772
00:58:19,442 --> 00:58:21,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all right.
It's all right.</font>

773
00:58:21,443 --> 00:58:23,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen. Listen.</font>

774
00:58:23,278 --> 00:58:25,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">All he's trying to say is,
it's wonderful to meet you,</font>

775
00:58:25,847 --> 00:58:27,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he wants you
to have a beautiful evening.</font>

776
00:58:29,652 --> 00:58:31,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll see you at 11:30.</font>

777
00:58:31,989 --> 00:58:33,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Yeah.</font>

778
00:58:33,456 --> 00:58:36,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">- 11:30. Yeah. 11:30.
- Good choice.</font>

779
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think he got
the picture, bro.</font>

780
00:58:51,141 --> 00:58:52,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Psst.</font>

781
00:59:24,373 --> 00:59:26,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">Beers and sake,
let's go.</font>

782
00:59:26,076 --> 00:59:28,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have wine.
What the fuck?</font>

783
01:00:02,711 --> 01:00:03,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

784
01:00:05,047 --> 01:00:06,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">Buddy.</font>

785
01:00:07,617 --> 01:00:08,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Donnie, right?</font>

786
01:00:08,951 --> 01:00:10,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah.
- Yeah.</font>

787
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:12,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, spotted you at the gym
the other day, yeah?</font>

788
01:00:12,755 --> 01:00:14,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, man. How you doing?</font>

789
01:00:14,391 --> 01:00:15,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's up, fellows?</font>

790
01:00:19,228 --> 01:00:20,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">You play football
at Long Beach Poly?</font>

791
01:00:21,396 --> 01:00:22,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">You look familiar.</font>

792
01:00:23,567 --> 01:00:25,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I'm not from
around here.</font>

793
01:00:28,137 --> 01:00:30,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing here?
You work around here?</font>

794
01:00:32,307 --> 01:00:34,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enjoying my dinner, man.</font>

795
01:00:34,478 --> 01:00:35,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Really?
Yeah.</font>

796
01:00:35,911 --> 01:00:36,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Food here sucks.</font>

797
01:00:38,447 --> 01:00:42,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Yeah,
we come here for the ass.</font>

798
01:00:48,090 --> 01:00:49,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I'll see you
at the gym, man.</font>

799
01:00:54,163 --> 01:00:57,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Definitely.</font>

800
01:00:57,166 --> 01:00:58,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have a good night.</font>

801
01:01:05,675 --> 01:01:09,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">Number 55, right?
That's how I remember you.</font>

802
01:01:09,278 --> 01:01:11,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">We wore the same number,
55, right?</font>

803
01:01:12,114 --> 01:01:13,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">I went to South Torrance.</font>

804
01:01:13,650 --> 01:01:16,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, we played you guys
a couple of times.</font>

805
01:01:16,519 --> 01:01:19,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">You and all those
fat-ass Samoans.</font>

806
01:01:19,188 --> 01:01:22,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, they were big,
but, man, lazy motherfuckers.</font>

807
01:01:22,625 --> 01:01:24,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">Probably all that Spam.</font>

808
01:01:25,961 --> 01:01:27,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, we fucking
crushed you guys.</font>

809
01:01:27,998 --> 01:01:31,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">Crushed you guys when I was there.
Crushed you guys when you were there.</font>

810
01:01:31,802 --> 01:01:33,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">Still crushing you guys.</font>

811
01:01:35,538 --> 01:01:37,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've got family here, bro.</font>

812
01:01:37,873 --> 01:01:39,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't really appreciate
you popping off.</font>

813
01:01:39,842 --> 01:01:42,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. All right, man.
No need to get all agro.</font>

814
01:01:42,813 --> 01:01:45,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was I being rude?
Was I being rude?</font>

815
01:01:45,548 --> 01:01:46,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh?</font>

816
01:01:46,849 --> 01:01:49,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- Let's go order, bro.</font>

817
01:01:49,152 --> 01:01:50,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, look, man, listen.</font>

818
01:01:50,987 --> 01:01:54,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've got a beautiful family.
Everything's all good. Excuse us.</font>

819
01:01:58,027 --> 01:01:59,061
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Kampai.</i></font>

820
01:02:00,396 --> 01:02:01,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">See you at the gym, Donnie.</font>

821
01:02:03,199 --> 01:02:04,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have a good night, ladies.</font>

822
01:02:32,862 --> 01:02:34,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">You a cop?</font>

823
01:02:35,699 --> 01:02:38,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Are you?</font>

824
01:02:46,710 --> 01:02:47,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out of the car.</font>

825
01:02:56,885 --> 01:02:57,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go!</font>

826
01:03:17,773 --> 01:03:18,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where's the wire?
- Come on, man.</font>

827
01:03:18,974 --> 01:03:20,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not wearing
a fucking wire, man.</font>

828
01:03:22,746 --> 01:03:24,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Man, I'm not wearing
no fucking wire.</font>

829
01:03:29,786 --> 01:03:30,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get up.</font>

830
01:03:40,461 --> 01:03:42,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">How does he know you?</font>

831
01:03:42,498 --> 01:03:44,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't tell me it's
from the fucking gym.</font>

832
01:03:46,135 --> 01:03:47,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I don't know him.</font>

833
01:03:47,769 --> 01:03:48,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">Smoke this punk.</font>

834
01:03:52,976 --> 01:03:55,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">Talk, motherfucker.</font>

835
01:03:55,778 --> 01:03:57,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm no cop, all right?</font>

836
01:03:57,646 --> 01:03:59,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now he came to me.
He know you.</font>

837
01:03:59,815 --> 01:04:02,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">He know all of you.
But I ain't tell him shit.</font>

838
01:04:02,786 --> 01:04:04,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was sweating me.
I ain't seen him since.</font>

839
01:04:04,353 --> 01:04:06,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought he'd
leave us alone.</font>

840
01:04:14,130 --> 01:04:15,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">So how much do they know?</font>

841
01:04:17,467 --> 01:04:18,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing.</font>

842
01:04:19,668 --> 01:04:21,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">I ain't tell them shit.</font>

843
01:04:21,471 --> 01:04:23,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know nothing anyway.</font>

844
01:04:23,972 --> 01:04:26,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you know I'm the last
person that would fuck this up.</font>

845
01:04:28,878 --> 01:04:30,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, if we've got to
call it off, I get it.</font>

846
01:04:32,146 --> 01:04:33,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I know
I ain't tell them shit.</font>

847
01:04:57,405 --> 01:05:00,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Friday. Make sure
he knows it's on.</font>

848
01:05:28,038 --> 01:05:30,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So good.</font>

849
01:05:30,072 --> 01:05:32,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's true, though.
It's true.</font>

850
01:05:33,543 --> 01:05:34,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

851
01:05:35,545 --> 01:05:36,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

852
01:05:46,556 --> 01:05:47,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">How you doing, Nick?</font>

853
01:05:47,958 --> 01:05:49,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

854
01:05:51,059 --> 01:05:53,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm Nick.
- Hello.</font>

855
01:05:53,096 --> 01:05:55,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How are you?
- Good.</font>

856
01:05:59,802 --> 01:06:01,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's for...</font>

857
01:06:01,403 --> 01:06:03,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's for dinner?
- You smell like alcohol, Nick.</font>

858
01:06:03,940 --> 01:06:05,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm?</font>

859
01:06:08,777 --> 01:06:09,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Relax.</font>

860
01:06:10,778 --> 01:06:12,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">I already ate.</font>

861
01:06:19,456 --> 01:06:21,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me a pen, stud.</font>

862
01:06:21,458 --> 01:06:23,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nick, I was gonna call you.</font>

863
01:06:23,625 --> 01:06:25,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was gonna take you
to dinner next week.</font>

864
01:06:25,161 --> 01:06:27,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just give me a fucking pen.</font>

865
01:06:45,181 --> 01:06:46,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks, Ruud.</font>

866
01:06:48,784 --> 01:06:51,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm gonna hit the...
- No, you're not.</font>

867
01:06:58,460 --> 01:06:59,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">How's the wine?</font>

868
01:07:02,463 --> 01:07:03,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good?</font>

869
01:07:07,536 --> 01:07:09,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's pretty fucking good.</font>

870
01:07:11,373 --> 01:07:13,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I imagine I just, uh...</font>

871
01:07:13,175 --> 01:07:17,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, just sign
anywhere, yeah?</font>

872
01:07:17,679 --> 01:07:19,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

873
01:07:19,315 --> 01:07:22,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I imagine it's assumed
that if you were ever</font>

874
01:07:22,885 --> 01:07:26,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">to touch one of my girls
or, say, talk to them</font>

875
01:07:26,822 --> 01:07:28,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">or, you know,
even look at them,</font>

876
01:07:30,159 --> 01:07:33,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">I go boom-boom. You
know what I'm saying?</font>

877
01:07:33,362 --> 01:07:34,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, I mean, that's
self-evident, right?</font>

878
01:07:34,864 --> 01:07:37,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no need to put that
in the contract, is there?</font>

879
01:07:37,699 --> 01:07:39,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, I didn't think so.
- Nick...</font>

880
01:07:44,206 --> 01:07:46,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you please go, Nick?</font>

881
01:07:47,543 --> 01:07:49,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's enough, Nick.
- Sure.</font>

882
01:07:54,682 --> 01:07:55,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

883
01:07:57,251 --> 01:07:59,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come here.
Give me a hug.</font>

884
01:07:59,721 --> 01:08:02,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on. We'll save
a fortune in therapy.</font>

885
01:08:05,394 --> 01:08:06,396

1245
01:44:32,412 --> 01:44:35,048

<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, yeah, yeah.</font>

1248
01:45:01,274 --> 01:45:03,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">They went to brown.
They're clearing out.</font>

1249

<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you think it is?</font>

1257
01:45:52,493 --> 01:45:54,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are the cameras
up in the 100 room?</font>

1258
01:45:55,694 --> 01:45:56,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, negative.</font>

01:46:23,489 --> 01:46:24,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, man, we're still brown.</font>

1270
01:46:26,826 --> 01:46:29,359

<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

1272
01:46:32,832 --> 01:46:33,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Done.</font>

1273
01:46:33,868 --> 01:46:35,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Better get
that count, too.</font>

1274
01:46:47,346 --> 01:46:50,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shit, here comes security.
Get down. Get down.</font>

1275

1281
01:47:13,105 --> 01:47:15,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, dumb-dumb. You've got to
let go of the push to talk.</font>

1282
01:47:18,578 --> 01:47:20,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell is
going on here today?</font>

1283
01:47:23,917 --> 01:47:25,250
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Luigi, man. He's stepping
all over the line.</i></font>

I'm stepping out.</i></font>

1287

1288
01:47:49,442 --> 01:47:50,578

anything, man?</font>

1297

nothing back there but dust.</font>

1299
01:49:55,101 --> 01:49:56,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry about it, man. I'm gonna
juice up the room, run the count,</font>

1315

ahead and clock out Alameda.</font>

1316

1322
01:51:55,020 --> 01:51:58,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">Next time,
just put it in a cash sack.</font>

1323

1494
02:16:45,093 --> 02:16:46,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">Apparently so.</font>

1495
