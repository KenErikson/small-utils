at the hotel last night?</font>

161
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,714

- Thanks, man.</font>

168
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,108

about dogs so much?</font>

171
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't know.
I just like strays, and they like me.</font>

172
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,390

because you feed them.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">We used to have a dog.</font>

180
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seriously?</font>

181
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had you down as
more of a cat person.</font>

182
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't talk
about that stuff, huh?</font>

183
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

184
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Your past.
- I don't remember much.</font>

185
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just fragments.
Bits and pieces.</font>

186
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about family?</font>

187
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">My parents, they died
bringing us to this country.</font>

188
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our boat sank in the harbor.</font>

189
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">I almost drowned.</font>

190
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">It feels like</font>

191
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">there's always this
thick fog over my memory</font>

192
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,957

193
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're lucky.</font>

194
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every single day
I get screwed by my memories.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">It's better to be pure.</font>

196
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,515

00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe next time,
you can design me better.</font>

202
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">How are you?</font>

203
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm fine.
I can't feel anything.</font>

204
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you. In there.</font>

205
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been having glitches.</font>

206
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">But they'll pass.</font>

00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've been
taking your medication?</font>

208
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

209
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">But these ones are still cycling.</font>

210
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had two this morning.</font>

211
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sound or image?
- Both.</font>

212
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see it.</font>

213
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you made
any unencrypted downloads?</font>

214
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No. Just delete them for me.
- Consent?</font>

215
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">My name is Major Mira Killian,</font>

216
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,429

217
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's done.</font>

218
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No big deal.
- What are they?</font>

219
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sensory echoes from
your mind. Shadows.</font>

220
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't be sure.</font>

221
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you know
what's a glitch and what's me?</font>

222
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">The glitches have
a different texture</font>

223
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">to the rest of your code.</font>

224
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can see everything.</font>

225
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">All of your thoughts,
your decisions.</font>

226
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess privacy is just for humans.</font>

227
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are human.</font>

228
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">People see you as human.</font>

229
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone around me seems to fit.</font>

230
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">They seem connected
to something, something I am</font>

231
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">not.</font>

232
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like I have no past.</font>

233
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course you have a past.</font>

234
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">And with time you'll feel
more and more connected to it,</font>

235
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">and to them.</font>

Are you finished yet?</font>

245
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you hadn't riddled
the geisha with bullets,</font>

246
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,589

247
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I didn't shoot her.
- I did.</font>

248
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is gonna take days.</font>

249
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to run hundreds
of potential simulations.</font>

250
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't have the time.</font>

251
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was a Hanka companion bot.</font>

252
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">But she was reprogramed
for cerebral hacking.</font>

253
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">What was on her drives?</font>

254
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing.</font>

255
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">The data was destroyed
as it was transmitted.</font>

256
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">No sign what she was after.</font>

257
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">The hardware was vandalized.</font>

258
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">They ripped her up!</font>

00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know.</font>

262
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">They could have left traps in her.</font>

263
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mag pulses. Viruses.</font>

264
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's right.</font>

265
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll be exposing your mind

266
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll be wide open.</font>

267
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to get

<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the fastest way to find Kuze.</font>

269
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's too dangerous.</font>

270
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">And highly irresponsible.</font>

271
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,839

284
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now!</font>

285
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,710

I'll lead.</font>

- That's unfair.</font>

293
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,956

What did you expect?</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't do mech work here.</font>

309
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">My mistake.</font>

310
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you come
have fun with us?</font>

311
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll have some privacy.</font>

312
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm in.</font>

313
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll be here
when you need me.</font>

314
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">You say your friend
worked here?</font>

315
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">I said my friend
had work done here.</font>

316
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's human?</font>

317
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your friend.</font>

318
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now what's that supposed to mean?</font>

319
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Batou.</font>

320
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you hear me?</font>

321
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:26,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who did this
stunning work on you?</font>

322
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's divine.</font>

323
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ladriya. Guns.</font>

324
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here.</font>

325
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">Batou, I'm losing signal.</font>

326
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry, sweetie.</font>

327
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have privacy.</font>

328
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen.</font>

329
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">No signals going in or out.</font>

330
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">Major, I'm in position.
Do you copy?</font>

331
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Beer.</font>

332
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you don't answer,
you're gonna hurt my feelings.</font>

333
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ladriya, do you have Major
on comms?</font>

334
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got nothing.
Signal's still blocked.</font>

335
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm afraid I get
bored rather easily, so,</font>

336
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you don't want to talk,</font>

337
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">maybe you want to dance!</font>

338
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Major, come on.
Answer me.</font>

339
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you said no trouble.</font>

340
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dance.</font>

341
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! Enough!</font>

342
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">The truth is...</font>

343
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

344
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wasn't built to dance.</font>

345
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">Back on comms.
I'm heading to the back room.</font>

346
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:02,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">I missed you.
I'll meet you there.</font>

347
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:37,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">Collaborate with Hanka Robotics
and be destroyed.</font>

348
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">Major?</font>

349
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

350
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's Batou?</font>

351
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:27,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">In Enhancement
next door. He's doing well.</font>

352
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">You took most of the blast.</font>

353
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw him down there.</font>

354
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was like...</font>

355
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">he waited to see me.</font>

356
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">We synaptic-scanned you.</font>

357
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:49,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything you witnessed
went to Section 9 to evaluate.</font>

358
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, the scan</font>

359
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">also turned up
a number of glitches.</font>

360
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">They've been getting worse.</font>

361
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Since when?</font>

362
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">Since the Deep Dive.</font>

363
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do any of the glitches
mean something to you?</font>

364
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

365
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">They don't.</font>

366
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:34,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've been inside
the same shell as he has.</font>

367
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:38,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">That could have
very serious consequences.</font>

368
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were not authorized
to Deep Dive the geisha.</font>

369
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're disappointed.</font>

370
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I'm worried.</font>

371
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not invulnerable.</font>

372
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can repair your body,
but I can't protect your mind.</font>

373
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why not?</font>

374
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can see all my thoughts,</font>

375
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">so you should be
able to secure them.</font>

376
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">Try and understand
your importance, Mira.</font>

377
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're what everyone
will become one day.</font>

378
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:24,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't know how alone
that makes me feel.</font>

379
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can see you out there,
you know.</font>

380
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many fingers
am I holding up?</font>

381
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">Funny.</font>

382
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say something nice.</font>

383
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">You chose those?</font>

384
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're tactical.</font>

385
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Always for the job.
- What else I got?</font>

386
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">- They suit you.
- Yeah?</font>

387
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got night-vision, mile-zoom,</font>

388
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">and X-ray.</font>

389
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess I see like you now.</font>

390
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry.
You'll get used to it.</font>

391
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks for saving my ass.</font>

392
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">Glad to see you're okay.</font>

393
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">Major?</font>

394
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could you feed the dogs for me?</font>

395
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to scare them.</font>

396
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anytime.</font>

397
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:28,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you insufficiently funded,
Mr. Aramaki?</font>

398
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is Section 9 missing some
critical operational resource?</font>

399
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">Major is our most sophisticated weapon</font>

400
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">only if she's intact.</font>

401
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Dr. Ouelet informed me</font>

402
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:46,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">that you let her dive
a corrupted geisha.</font>

403
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">You realize
the supreme importance</font>

404
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">that Hanka represents
to this government.</font>

405
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Major is the future of my company.</font>

406
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you compromise
her systems again,</font>

407
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will burn this section.</font>

408
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come here. With me.</font>

409
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Create your own beauty.</font>

410
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">Beauty enhanced.</font>

411
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">You human?</font>

412
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

413
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you take that off</font>

414
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I can see your face?</font>

415
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">What does that feel like?</font>

416
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">It feels</font>

417
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">different.</font>

418
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you?</font>

419
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at me.</font>

420
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me what
they took from me.</font>

421
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:10,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.
They never told us.</font>

422
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">It feels weird
driving with these eyes.</font>

423
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you take that?</font>

424
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">It keeps my brain
from rejecting this body.</font>

425
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Major, Batou, you need to get here.</font>

426
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">What have you got?</font>

427
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">Another Hanka
scientist has been found dead.</font>

428
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Dahlin.</font>

429
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got it.</font>

430
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">Major, this way.</font>

431
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is that?</font>

432
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:39,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">She found what Kuze
stole from Osmond.</font>

433
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:45,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a list of everyone who
worked on a project called 2571.</font>

434
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's who he's targeting.</font>

435
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is anyone else on the list?</font>

436
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:54,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">Find Ouelet. Now!</font>

437
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's in transit.
Her comms are down.</font>

438
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm looking at her
and I'm thinking,</font>

439
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:06,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">"You want me to pay for violin, too."</font>

440
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't get me wrong.</font>

441
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love that kid to pieces.</font>

442
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do. She's amazing.</font>

443
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">But when she practices that
thing, it is painful, right?</font>

444
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:18,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why not piano?</font>

445
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:21,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean,
it's the same price, you know?</font>

446
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">And doesn't sound so bad.</font>

447
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:28,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">At least, if you can't
play that proper, it sounds...</font>

448
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:20,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">2571. Tell me everything!</font>

449
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you prepared
to die for 257...</font>

450
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go!</font>

451
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go!</font>

452
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:58,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's Kuze?</font>

453
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why does he want to kill Ouelet?</font>

454
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know anything.</font>

455
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enough! Enough!</font>

456
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need him alive.</font>

457
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:16,999
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please,
I've been through this.</font>

458
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:20,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have the wrong guy.</font>

459
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">So tell us who we do have.</font>

460
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:28,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">My name is Lee Cunningham.</font>

461
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where'd you get the weapons?
- I don't know.</font>

462
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who loaded them onto the truck?</font>

463
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:37,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know anything about
weapons, all right? I told you!</font>

464
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:40,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was picking up my daughter.
She takes violin lessons.</font>

465
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's her name?</font>

466
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is this her?
- Yeah.</font>

467
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:50,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">Isn't she a little angel?</font>

468
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:51,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This is your daughter?
- Right.</font>

469
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:56,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you have kids?</font>

470
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where do you live?</font>

471
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't remember.</font>

472
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:08,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think it's a tall place.
Is it a tall building?</font>

473
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a tall place, right?</font>

474
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:12,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have a child.</font>

475
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:18,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have a wife.
You live alone.</font>

476
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:19,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's just you.
- What? No.</font>

477
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've been to your apartment.
There's nobody there.</font>

478
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:22,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- You've lived there</font>

479
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:23,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">- for 10 years by yourself.
- No!</font>

480
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you're just lying.</font>

481
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:26,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not lying!</font>

482
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't kill anyone!</font>

483
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:31,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why do you keep doing this to me?
- Holo cube disconnect.</font>

484
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:33,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please!</font>

485
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't do anything!</font>

486
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:37,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you keep
saying this to me?</font>

487
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:39,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't understand.
How can he not know?</font>

488
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">The hack must have created
a vacuum. Kuze's wiped his memory</font>

489
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">and somehow installed
a new reality.</font>

490
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:51,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">At least, he got to
believe he had a kid.</font>

491
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:54,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the difference, huh?</font>

492
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:57,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fantasy, reality.</font>

493
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:59,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dreams, memories.</font>

494
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all the same.</font>

495
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:04,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just noise.</font>

496
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:07,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's him.</font>

497
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's in there.</font>

498
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:17,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">This cube is secure.
He can't be, Major.</font>

499
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:18,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lie detector.</font>

500
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">He must've hacked in that way.</font>

501
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:21,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should uplink to the machine,</font>

502
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">trace the code,
get a lock on his location.</font>

503
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:24,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do it.</font>

504
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:27,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't go in there.
It's too dangerous!</font>

505
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">The signal's unstable.
Can you get a lock on it?</font>

506
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:46,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Think so.</font>

507
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:48,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">We gotta move fast.
We're losing it.</font>

508
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">Connecting.</font>

509
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are you?</font>

510
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:58,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come here.</font>

511
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:02,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am shy.</font>

512
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:05,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not beautiful</font>

513
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:06,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">like you.</font>

514
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:11,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me who you are.</font>

515
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:15,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have been born
more than once.</font>

516
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:18,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I have more than one name.</font>

517
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll find you.</font>

518
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not yet.</font>

519
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:24,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not done.</font>

520
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:27,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">The machine
is tracing his location.</font>

521
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:28,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got a fix!</font>

522
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:35,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to see her.</font>

523
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, please. I know...</font>

524
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:39,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got him.</font>

525
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go.</font>

526
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:04,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Weapons up.</font>

527
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Go.
- On me.</font>

528
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:58,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay down! Stay down!</font>

529
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:10,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put it down.
Put it down.</font>

530
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:18,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grenade!</font>

531
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:16,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">Major!</font>

532
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:18,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come in.</font>

533
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know why
we couldn't find him.</font>

534
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's using human minds
to create a network of his own.</font>

535
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:29,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're coming to your position.</font>

536
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:46,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me who you are.</font>

537
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:53,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am that
which you seek to destroy.</font>

538
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">In this life my name is</font>

539
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:02,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kuze.</font>

540
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:06,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing to me?</font>

541
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:14,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have connected you
to a network of my own creation.</font>

542
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I am finished
in this world,</font>

543
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:22,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">my ghost can survive there
and regenerate.</font>

544
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:24,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you want from me?</font>

545
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:27,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">I became</font>

546
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:30,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">fascinated with you,</font>

547
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:34,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">reading your code</font>

548
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:36,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">while you were inside
that geisha.</font>

549
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:42,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like nothing
I had felt before and yet so</font>

550
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">familiar.</font>

551
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:48,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are the same.</font>

552
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:51,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are not the same.</font>

553
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:56,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">You kill innocent people.</font>

554
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Innocent",
is that what you call them?</font>

555
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:02,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am as they made me.</font>

556
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who made you?</font>

557
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:07,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">What have they told you?</font>

558
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:09,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">That you were the first?</font>

559
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">The first cerebral salvage?</font>

560
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:17,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were born of lessons took</font>

561
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:19,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">from my failure.</font>

562
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:23,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you talking about?</font>

563
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:27,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was conscious
while they dismembered</font>

564
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:29,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">my body and discarded me</font>

565
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:31,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">like garbage.</font>

566
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:35,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was lying on a table,</font>

567
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:38,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">listening to doctors
talk about how</font>

568
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:41,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">my mind had not meshed
with the shell</font>

569
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:42,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">that they had built.</font>

570
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:47,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">How Project 2571</font>

571
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:49,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">had failed,</font>

572
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">and they had to move on</font>

573
00:57:58,040 --> 00:57:59,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">to you.</font>

574
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:08,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">What a beauty you are.</font>

575
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">They have improved us so much</font>

576
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:16,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">since they made me.</font>

577
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:24,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">They thought that we would be
a part of their evolution,</font>

578
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:26,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">but they have created us</font>

579
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:29,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">to evolve alone,</font>

580
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:35,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">beyond them.</font>

581
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Evolution",
that's what you call</font>

582
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:41,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">killing everyone who made you?</font>

583
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:44,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not listening to me.</font>

584
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a murderer.</font>

585
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:49,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">They tried to kill me first.</font>

586
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is self-defense.</font>

587
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">Defense of self!</font>

588
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:59,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">More will die</font>

589
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:03,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">until they tell me</font>

590
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:05,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">what they took!</font>

591
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:07,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">I won't let that happen.</font>

592
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to kill me?</font>

593
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:17,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like everyone else.</font>

594
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:25,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do it then.</font>

595
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:31,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do what you were
programed to do.</font>

596
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is that?</font>

597
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:58,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is that?</font>

598
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:03,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't remember,
but I am haunted by it.</font>

599
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:06,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you see it?</font>

600
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:12,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Togusa!</font>

601
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:22,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't take the medication
that they give you.</font>

602
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:25,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">They use it to suppress
your memories.</font>

603
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:30,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your shell belongs to them,
but not your ghost.</font>

604
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your ghost is yours.</font>

605
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember that,</font>

606
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:37,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">and maybe you can remember it all.</font>

607
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:48,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get away from her!
Get down on the ground, now!</font>

608
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:55,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Major!</font>

609
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:05,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">Major!</font>

610
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:25,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Mira.</font>

611
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:28,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God, you're safe!</font>

612
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:32,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've been gone for hours!</font>

613
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:36,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one knew where you were.</font>

614
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:42,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

615
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:46,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're scaring me.</font>

616
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:50,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Calm down.</font>

617
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:56,835

there would be failures.</font>

the whole time.</font>

652

653
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:08,636

661
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:44,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know where to find her.</font>

662
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:30,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't ask you to come here.</font>

663
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:33,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">You never ask.</font>

664
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:35,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I always do.</font>

665
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:41,758

Did you see any?</font>

667
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:48,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a company man.
You follow orders,</font>

668

to kill me...</font>

669
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:53,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop saying shit like that.
You're gonna piss me off.</font>

670
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:18,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's it like down there?</font>

671
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:21,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's cold and dark.</font>

672
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:25,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just a million miles away.</font>

675
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:33,188

- Then why do you do it?</font>

678
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:53,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">It feels real.</font>

679
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:56,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why didn't you stop him?</font>

680
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:01,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know who to trust anymore.</font>

681
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:04,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">You trust me, right?</font>

682
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:10,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I do.</font>

683
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:15,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just don't like it.</font>

684
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:25,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need you to take me back.</font>

685
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's more I need to find out.</font>

686
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:33,635

01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:53,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dr. Ouelet,</font>

688
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,956

689
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">She knows.</font>

690
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:02,238

692

693
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:16,232
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why is she sedated?</font>

694
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:19,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's been turned by a terrorist.</font>

695
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:22,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you know that already.</font>

696
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:28,155

she came to see you.</font>

697
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:30,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Instead, you gave her information.</font>

698
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:32,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">What makes you think
you have the right to tell me</font>

699
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:34,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">- what to do and what...
- 2571 took us close.</font>

700
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:36,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's time to move on
to the next iteration.</font>

701
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:38,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">2571 is not a failure.</font>

702
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:40,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll delete all the data

703
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:42,353

704

<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No, no, no.</font>

705
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:47,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">You download all the data
on the terrorist,</font>

706
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:49,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then I order you to terminate.</font>

707
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:54,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

708
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:56,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll build one that's better.</font>

709

<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'll delete everything.
- You've deleted before.</font>

710
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:05,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">- She's mine.
- No.</font>

711
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:08,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's a contract. With me.</font>

712
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:10,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">We succeeded.</font>

713
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:13,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's more than human
and more than A.I.</font>

714
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:16,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">We changed her entire identity.</font>

715
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:18,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">But her ghost survived!</font>

716
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:20,875

717
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:22,878

718
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:24,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's no longer a viable asset.</font>

719
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:32,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should be the one to do it.</font>

720
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:44,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing to me?</font>

721
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,036

01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:47,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I offer you some tea?</font>

774
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:49,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay.
- Uh-huh.</font>

775
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:01,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's Motoko's room.</font>

776
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:06,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">My daughter died a year ago.</font>

777
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:09,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

778
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:11,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">She ran away.</font>

779
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:13,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was difficult.</font>

780
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:18,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, uh, we fought.</font>

781
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:23,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I guess we all fight
with our parents, right?</font>

782
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please come and sit, yeah?</font>

783
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:49,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened to her?</font>

784
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:52,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

785
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:58,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">The ministry sent me her ashes,</font>

786
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:02,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">and they told me
she took her own life.</font>

787
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:08,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, Motoko...
No, no, no.</font>

788
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:12,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never believed them.</font>

789
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:14,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was happy,</font>

790
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:18,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">living in the lawless zone
with her friends.</font>

791
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:22,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">She'd write her manifestos about</font>

792
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:28,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">how technology was
destroying the world.</font>

793
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:32,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then, one day,</font>

794
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:34,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">the police came,</font>

795
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:36,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">and they ran.</font>

796
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:46,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's strange.</font>

797
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:56,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see her
in so many young women.</font>

798
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:00,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">On the street,
in my dreams.</font>

799
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:04,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">As if she's still here.</font>

800
01:18:05,240 --> 01:18:06,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was</font>

801
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:09,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">fearless!</font>

802
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:13,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">And wild.</font>

803
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:16,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">You remind me of her.</font>

804
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:19,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry.</font>

805
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:25,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do I remind you of her?</font>

806
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:30,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">The way you look at me.</font>

807
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:37,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are you?</font>

808
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:42,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

809
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:45,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, wait, wait!</font>

810
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:50,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you come again to visit me?</font>

811
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:53,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will.</font>

812
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:21,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aramaki.</font>

813
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen to me.</font>

814
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:26,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was never in a terrorist bombing.</font>

815
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:27,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">My parents,</font>

816
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:31,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">everything was data
they installed in my mind.</font>

817
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:34,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">And there were others.</font>

818
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:36,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">Runaways like me</font>

819
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:39,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">considered disposable.</font>

820
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:42,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kuze was one of them.
That's why he's coming.</font>

821
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:45,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">For Hanka.</font>

822
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:50,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dr. Ouelet can.</font>

823
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:06,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put me on the grid.</font>

824
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:07,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need Kuze to find me.</font>

825
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:14,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know.
But I need to do this.</font>

826
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:31,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">The virus has spread.</font>

827
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:07,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shh.</font>

828
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:02,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've located Major on the grid.</font>

829
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:04,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's in the lawless zone.</font>

830
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:06,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">Air support five minutes out.</font>

831
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:09,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is the spider tank within range?</font>

832
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, sir.
Awaiting your orders, sir.</font>

833
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:17,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hideo!</font>

834
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:19,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">Motoko!</font>

835
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:29,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is real.</font>

836
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:34,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">This place.</font>

837
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:45,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remember what they did to us.</font>

838
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:47,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cutter and his men.</font>

839
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:49,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is where they took us from.</font>

840
01:25:56,920 --> 01:25:58,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">We used to sleep right here.</font>

841
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:02,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were like a family,</font>

842
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:04,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">all of us runaways.</font>

843
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:07,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">We had nothing,</font>

844
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:13,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">except each other.</font>

845
01:26:17,160 --> 01:26:19,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">They took that from us.</font>

846
01:26:35,640 --> 01:26:37,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your name was Hideo.</font>

847
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:50,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Motoko.</font>

848
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:54,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was your name.</font>

849
01:26:58,280 --> 01:26:59,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">Motoko.</font>

850
01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:04,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come with me</font>

851
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:08,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">into my network.</font>

852
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:11,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">We will evolve beyond them.</font>

853
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:16,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">And together, we can avenge
what they have done to us.</font>

854
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:18,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come</font>

855
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:20,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">with me.</font>

856
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:39,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll take control from here.</font>

857
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:42,196
<font color="#FFFFFF">Weapons system manual command.</font>

858
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:45,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Spider tank now active.</font>

859
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:56,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Cutter! He found us!</font>

860
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:36,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">Target acquired.</font>

861
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:39,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

862
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:50,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">Target eliminated.</font>

863
01:30:06,760 --> 01:30:08,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">You came close,</font>

864
01:30:08,840 --> 01:30:10,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">you freak.</font>

865
01:30:42,440 --> 01:30:44,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">Motor center compromised.</font>

866
01:31:28,200 --> 01:31:30,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sniper team on site?</font>

867
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:32,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're approaching
the targets now, sir.</font>

868
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:36,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come with me.</font>

869
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:41,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is no place for us here.</font>

870
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:47,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

871
01:31:52,720 --> 01:31:55,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not ready to leave.</font>

872
01:31:56,720 --> 01:31:58,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">I belong here.</font>

873
01:32:02,120 --> 01:32:04,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will always be there with you</font>

874
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:07,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">in your ghost.</font>

875
01:32:14,440 --> 01:32:15,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">Target is in view.</font>

876
01:32:15,880 --> 01:32:17,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you waiting for?</font>

877
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:18,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do it!</font>

878
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:22,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

879
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:24,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep firing.</font>

880
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

881
01:32:59,320 --> 01:33:00,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

882
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:06,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say something nice.</font>

883
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:09,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's your name?</font>

884
01:33:09,880 --> 01:33:13,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aramaki told me
you had a name from before.</font>

885
01:33:17,320 --> 01:33:19,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Motoko.</font>

886
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:25,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">Major is still in there, right?</font>

887
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:29,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am.</font>

888
01:33:57,200 --> 01:33:59,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought
that it might be you.</font>

889
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:26,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please.</font>

890
01:34:34,840 --> 01:34:36,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell him this is justice.</font>

891
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:39,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's what I was built for.</font>

892
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:45,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">My name is Major,</font>

893
01:34:46,120 --> 01:34:48,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I give my consent.</font>

894
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:01,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have to come here anymore.</font>

895
01:36:04,440 --> 01:36:05,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know.</font>

896
01:36:40,360 --> 01:36:43,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">My mind is human.</font>

897
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:46,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">My body is manufactured.</font>

898
01:36:48,680 --> 01:36:50,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm the first of my kind,</font>

899
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:54,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I won't be the last.</font>

900
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:01,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">We cling to memories
as if they define us.</font>

901
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:06,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">But what we do defines us.</font>

902
01:37:12,360 --> 01:37:15,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">My ghost survived
to remind the next of us</font>

903
01:37:16,600 --> 01:37:19,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">that humanity is our virtue.</font>

904
01:37:21,720 --> 01:37:23,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know who I am</font>

905
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:26,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">and what I'm here to do.</font>
