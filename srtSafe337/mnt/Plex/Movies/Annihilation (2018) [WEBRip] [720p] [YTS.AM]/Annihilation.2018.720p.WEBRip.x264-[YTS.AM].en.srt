47
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanted to ask,</font>

48
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,319

49
00:04:37,401 --> 00:04:39,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sarah and I have a few people over.</font>

50
00:04:39,987 --> 00:04:41,906

51
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, I do have plans.</font>

52
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:46,827

00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:21,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to know what the fuck I'm doing here.</font>

157
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:26,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your research area is the genetically programmed life cycle of a cell.</font>

158
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is my husband?</font>

159
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:30,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I'd like to talk about Sergeant Kane.</font>

160
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">When did he arrive back home?</font>

161
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:39,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I want to see a lawyer.
- You're not gonna be able to see a lawyer.</font>

162
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:46,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did he explain how he got back?</font>

163
00:13:48,451 --> 00:13:51,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- Did he contact you at any point</font>

164
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">while he was away?</font>

165
00:13:52,914 --> 00:13:53,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

166
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:58,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did he tell you about his mission when he returned?</font>

167
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Nothing.
- Or right before he left?</font>

168
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:03,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did he ever mention where he was going, what he was doing?</font>

169
00:14:04,259 --> 00:14:05,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">He never said, I never asked.</font>

170
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:10,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you made regular requests for information from his unit CO.</font>

171
00:14:11,933 --> 00:14:13,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">Until six months ago, and then you stopped.</font>

172
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why was that? Thought he was dead?</font>

173
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:20,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">Time to move on?</font>

174
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not easy to move on.</font>

175
00:14:26,447 --> 00:14:27,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't.</font>

176
00:14:34,914 --> 00:14:37,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm done answering questions.
It's your turn.</font>

177
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:40,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your husband's here.</font>

178
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's extremely ill.</font>

179
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:47,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">- In what way?
- Multiple organ failure.</font>

180
00:14:48,928 --> 00:14:50,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">Massive internal bleeding.</font>

181
00:14:51,472 --> 00:14:55,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">He must have been exposed to some sort of radiation,</font>

182
00:14:55,727 --> 00:14:57,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">some kind of virus.</font>

183
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have to tell me where he was, what he was doing.</font>

184
00:15:03,568 --> 00:15:05,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could actually help him.</font>

185
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,491
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>A religious event.</i></font>

186
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,577
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>An extraterrestrial event.</i></font>

187
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,163
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>A higher dimension.</i></font>

188
00:15:57,956 --> 00:15:59,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have many theories,</font>

189
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:01,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">few facts.</font>

190
00:16:02,293 --> 00:16:04,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">It started around three years ago.</font>

191
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:08,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blackwater National Park reported that a lighthouse was surrounded</font>

192
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">by something they termed "a shimmer."</font>

193
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:15,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">One of the wardens went in to investigate.</font>

194
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:17,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never returned.</font>

195
00:16:18,851 --> 00:16:20,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">The event was classified.</font>

196
00:16:20,812 --> 00:16:23,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Since then, we've approached by land, by sea,</font>

197
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:26,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">sent in drones, animals, and teams of people.</font>

198
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">But nothing comes back.</font>

199
00:16:30,405 --> 00:16:32,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the boundary's getting bigger.
It's expanding.</font>

200
00:16:33,241 --> 00:16:35,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">So far, it's eating into barely populated swampland,</font>

201
00:16:35,827 --> 00:16:40,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">which, you know, we evacuated under the pretext of a chemical spill,</font>

202
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:43,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">but... that won't last much longer.</font>

203
00:16:43,918 --> 00:16:48,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">In a few months, the area will have grown to where we are right now.</font>

204
00:16:51,384 --> 00:16:54,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then we're talking cities...</font>

205
00:16:54,971 --> 00:16:59,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">states... and so on.</font>

206
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said nothing comes back.</font>

207
00:17:04,397 --> 00:17:05,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">But something has.</font>

208
00:17:07,942 --> 00:17:08,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

209
00:17:17,618 --> 00:17:18,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's dying.</font>

210
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:21,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

211
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:28,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to come to an agreement about what to do with you.</font>

212
00:17:28,463 --> 00:17:30,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not going to let me go home?</font>

213
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:36,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that what you want... to go home?</font>

214
00:17:40,808 --> 00:17:41,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

215
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to be with him.</font>

216
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:04,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not talking to me.</font>

217
00:18:06,876 --> 00:18:07,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry.</font>

218
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:10,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">Zoned out.</font>

219
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thinking about the next mission?</font>

220
00:18:16,636 --> 00:18:17,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

221
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was just looking at the moon.</font>

222
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:25,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's always so weird seeing it like that in the daylight.</font>

223
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:27,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like God made a mistake.</font>

224
00:18:27,897 --> 00:18:29,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">Left the hall lights on.</font>

225
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">God doesn't make mistakes.
That's...</font>

226
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">somewhat key to the whole "being a god" thing.</font>

227
00:18:37,031 --> 00:18:38,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pretty sure he does.</font>

228
00:18:39,367 --> 00:18:41,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know he's listening right now, don't you?</font>

229
00:18:43,454 --> 00:18:44,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">You take a cell,</font>

230
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:47,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">circumvent the Hayflick limit, you can prevent senescence.</font>

231
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was about to make the exact same point.</font>

232
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:54,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">It means the cell doesn't grow old, it becomes immortal.</font>

233
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:55,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keeps dividing, doesn't die.</font>

234
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">They say aging is a natural process, but it's actually a fault in our genes.</font>

235
00:19:05,184 --> 00:19:07,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">I get really turned on when you patronize me.
It's really hot.</font>

236
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:10,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">Without it, I could keep looking like this forever.</font>

237
00:19:10,731 --> 00:19:11,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, okay.</font>

238
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that could constitute a mistake.</font>

239
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:22,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">You didn't tell me where you're heading this time.</font>

240
00:19:24,453 --> 00:19:27,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know there's something strange about this mission.</font>

241
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:32,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

242
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:36,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">The silence around it is louder than usual.</font>

243
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:41,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kind of angling for a clue here.</font>

244
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">So...?</font>

245
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:53,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll be under the same hemisphere.</font>

246
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:56,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">What does that tell me?</font>

247
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:01,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">It tells you that if you step outside and you look up...</font>

248
00:20:03,492 --> 00:20:04,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">we'll be looking at the same stars.</font>

249
00:20:05,077 --> 00:20:07,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Holy fucking shit.
- What?</font>

250
00:20:07,397 --> 00:20:08,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You kidding?
- What?</font>

251
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:11,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think that's what I do while you're away?</font>

252
00:20:12,376 --> 00:20:15,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- You think I'm out in the garden,</font>

253
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">pining, looking up at the sky?</font>

254
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:21,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Shut up. All right.
- Oh, to think my beloved Kane...</font>

255
00:20:21,886 --> 00:20:25,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay. Uh-huh.
- ... is looking at the selfsame moon.</font>

256
00:20:25,848 --> 00:20:26,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop it.</font>

257
00:20:27,058 --> 00:20:30,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my distant celestial friend...</font>

258
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No.</font>

259
00:20:33,105 --> 00:20:35,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">please care for my brave soldier.</font>

260
00:20:35,483 --> 00:20:37,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus. You know what?
You are disrespectful,</font>

261
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:40,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">seriously, not only to your former comrades in the armed forces,</font>

262
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:42,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">- but also to the president.
- You forgot the flag.</font>

263
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:45,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I'm getting... I'm getting to the motherfucking flag.</font>

264
00:20:45,368 --> 00:20:46,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my hero.</font>

265
00:20:46,494 --> 00:20:48,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Screw you.
- Okay.</font>

266
00:20:58,589 --> 00:21:01,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's all by herself.
Don't you think we should make friends?</font>

267
00:21:01,884 --> 00:21:04,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, obviously <i>you </i>should.
- Yep, I'll do it.</font>

268
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:09,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

269
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

270
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:13,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Am I intruding?
- No, not at all.</font>

271
00:21:14,855 --> 00:21:16,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cool. Phew.</font>

272
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:19,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I always see you here alone.
It's...</font>

273
00:21:20,653 --> 00:21:24,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm guessing you probably feel weird or awkward.</font>

274
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:27,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somewhat, I guess.</font>

275
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:31,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't. Seriously, don't.</font>

276
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">The people here put themselves to sleep in the fetal position</font>

277
00:21:35,167 --> 00:21:36,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">making cooing noises.</font>

278
00:21:37,336 --> 00:21:39,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's freaky, you know.</font>

279
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm Anya.
- Lena.</font>

280
00:21:43,175 --> 00:21:44,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.</font>

281
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:48,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, why don't you come and meet my crew?</font>

282
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come make friends. Come on.</font>

283
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:54,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ladies, meet Lena.</font>

284
00:21:54,395 --> 00:21:56,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hi nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.</font>

285
00:21:56,355 --> 00:21:59,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, that's Cassie Sheppard, and Josie Radek.</font>

286
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:00,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Hi.</font>

287
00:22:01,068 --> 00:22:03,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do you want to have a seat?
- Thank you.</font>

288
00:22:03,904 --> 00:22:07,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So, first day at the Southern Reach.
- Yes.</font>

289
00:22:07,491 --> 00:22:08,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah!</font>

290
00:22:08,868 --> 00:22:10,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thank you.
- You're welcome.</font>

291
00:22:11,329 --> 00:22:12,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">You all been here a long time?</font>

292
00:22:13,414 --> 00:22:15,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, yeah, right from the start.</font>

293
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a geomorphologist.</font>

294
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:20,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been testing the magnetic fields around the boundary,</font>

295
00:22:20,338 --> 00:22:23,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">which is like using confetti to test a hurricane.</font>

296
00:22:24,175 --> 00:22:27,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, and I've been here... ten months.</font>

297
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:29,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow, ten months.</font>

298
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">Paramedic from Chicago.</font>

299
00:22:31,223 --> 00:22:33,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tried to join an NGO, but my application got flagged,</font>

300
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:34,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">so Southern Reach got me.</font>

301
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:37,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only two months. I'm a physicist.</font>

302
00:22:37,271 --> 00:22:39,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">I came straight from my Cambridge postdoc.</font>

303
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's very smart.</font>

304
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:44,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's your story, Lena?</font>

305
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, I'm from Johns Hopkins, biologist.</font>

306
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:48,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, there you go.
- Ha... a biologist?</font>

307
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:50,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Told you she was smart.
- What?</font>

308
00:22:50,201 --> 00:22:53,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">We had a bet on your profession, and Josie had biologist, of course.</font>

309
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:58,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I had law enforcement.
- I had you as single.</font>

310
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:01,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus. Do you have to hit on everyone, like all the time?</font>

311
00:23:01,337 --> 00:23:02,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, fuck that. Under the circumstances,</font>

312
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:05,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I'm allowed to roll the dice a few more times.</font>

313
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:07,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Under what circumstances?</font>

314
00:23:10,888 --> 00:23:13,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, yeah, um, crazy as it seems...</font>

315
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">Crazy as it <i>is.</i></font>

316
00:23:18,771 --> 00:23:20,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">we are headed that way.</font>

317
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:28,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You are going into the Shimmer?
- Six days and counting.</font>

318
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You three?
- Four.</font>

319
00:23:32,827 --> 00:23:33,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ventress.</font>

320
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:38,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Dr. Ventress.
- Mmm. Team leader.</font>

321
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:41,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">- All women.
- Scientists.</font>

322
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">The previous teams have been largely military, so, yeah.</font>

323
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:47,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you think happened to them?</font>

324
00:23:48,384 --> 00:23:51,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, there are two theories of what went wrong in the Shimmer.</font>

325
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">One, something kills them.</font>

326
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,852
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two, they go crazy and kill each other.</font>

327
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:00,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">There was one military guy who made it out.</font>

328
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

329
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:03,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">A sergeant.</font>

330
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but you heard about the state that he was in.</font>

331
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kane...</font>

332
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know why you went in.</font>

333
00:25:08,714 --> 00:25:10,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am so sorry.</font>

334
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I know what I have to do.</font>

335
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:22,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you didn't tell them about your connection to Sergeant Kane?</font>

336
00:25:22,436 --> 00:25:25,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought it would complicate things.</font>

337
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

338
00:25:28,192 --> 00:25:29,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">What would it complicate?</font>

339
00:25:36,242 --> 00:25:38,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you going into the Shimmer?</font>

340
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:45,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">The mission statement is to reach the supposed source of the Shimmer,</font>

341
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:49,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">the lighthouse, enter and acquire data, and return.</font>

342
00:25:51,715 --> 00:25:54,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I don't think that that's your mission statement.</font>

343
00:26:00,182 --> 00:26:01,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

344
00:26:09,483 --> 00:26:12,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been watching the phenomenon for a while now.</font>

345
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:16,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">I profile the volunteers.</font>

346
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">I pick the teams.</font>

347
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:24,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">They enter, I watch.</font>

348
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">I watch it grow closer.</font>

349
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's only so long one can do that.</font>

350
00:26:36,385 --> 00:26:38,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you need to know what's inside?</font>

351
00:26:39,972 --> 00:26:42,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I do.</font>

352
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">So do I.</font>

353
00:26:47,271 --> 00:26:49,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">So that's the complication.</font>

354
00:26:50,733 --> 00:26:52,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to come with us.</font>

355
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:55,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't do anything for him here.</font>

356
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:58,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">Soldier-scientist.</font>

357
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can fight.</font>

358
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:03,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can learn.</font>

359
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:07,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can save him.</font>

360
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:16,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">You requested to join the mission.</font>

361
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">You knew all other missions had failed</font>

362
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the only survivor was barely surviving.</font>

363
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:23,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was a brave choice.</font>

364
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:25,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">I owed him.</font>

365
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm only trying to understand what drove you.</font>

366
00:27:34,234 --> 00:27:35,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">I owed him...</font>

367
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:39,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I went in.</font>

368
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then we get some real meals.</font>

369
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:29,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">Spaghetti.
Here's Radek's vegetable crackers.</font>

370
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:34,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow, cornbread. That's not so bad.</font>

371
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:36,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you're finally awake.</font>

372
00:30:36,792 --> 00:30:39,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">You gotta give me a second.
I'm a little disoriented.</font>

373
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:41,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">Join the club.</font>

374
00:30:42,089 --> 00:30:44,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't remember setting up camp, do you?</font>

375
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:50,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't remember anything... after we reached the tree line.</font>

376
00:30:51,473 --> 00:30:52,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">None of us do.</font>

377
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:54,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we did a food inventory.</font>

378
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:59,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">From the depletion, we've been out here for at least three or four days.</font>

379
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:02,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not possible.</font>

380
00:31:03,193 --> 00:31:04,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what I said.</font>

381
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:11,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, I've been checking my comms and nav equipment.</font>

382
00:31:11,493 --> 00:31:13,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">They boot up fine, no problem with the electronics,</font>

383
00:31:13,704 --> 00:31:15,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the camera is working, but</font>

384
00:31:15,205 --> 00:31:19,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">anything that sends a signal out of the Shimmer... is down.</font>

385
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:22,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even though we've probably got about 20 satellites above us right now,</font>

386
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:24,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">and... check this out.</font>

387
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:32,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we've got no compass, no comms, no coordinates...</font>

388
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:34,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">and no landmarks.</font>

389
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:36,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we know we're in the State Park.</font>

390
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:37,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">We head south, we hit the ocean,</font>

391
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:41,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">then we can just follow the shoreline until we hit the perimeter wall. Right?</font>

392
00:31:42,983 --> 00:31:46,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How we know is south?
- Come on, Josie, you know this.</font>

393
00:31:46,403 --> 00:31:47,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hour hand at the sun.</font>

394
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:51,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">Split the difference between the hour hand and 12, south.</font>

395
00:31:52,826 --> 00:31:53,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good.</font>

396
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're oriented.</font>

397
00:31:55,913 --> 00:31:59,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">We weren't really expecting the comms equipment to work, were we?</font>

398
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:03,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's been three years of expeditions and three years of radio silence.</font>

399
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:06,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's pack up and get moving.</font>

400
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've already lost a lot of the day.</font>

401
00:33:09,528 --> 00:33:12,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I'm gonna check this out.
Get us out of this damn swamp.</font>

402
00:33:12,406 --> 00:33:15,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.
Let's check out the hut.</font>

403
00:33:34,136 --> 00:33:36,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like someone's about to have a wedding.</font>

404
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:41,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">These are very strange.</font>

405
00:33:42,269 --> 00:33:43,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

406
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:46,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, they're all so different.</font>

407
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:50,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">To look at them, you wouldn't say that they're the same species.</font>

408
00:33:52,029 --> 00:33:54,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">But they're growing from the same branch structure...</font>

409
00:33:55,407 --> 00:33:57,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">so it has to be the same species.</font>

410
00:33:58,161 --> 00:33:59,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the same plant.</font>

411
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like they're stuck in a continuous mutation.</font>

412
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:04,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">A pathology?</font>

413
00:34:05,917 --> 00:34:06,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well...</font>

414
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:12,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">you'd sure as hell call it a pathology if you saw this in a human.</font>

415
00:34:22,934 --> 00:34:24,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jackpot.</font>

416
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:27,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sheppard! Mode of transportation.</font>

417
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:34,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anything interesting in there?</font>

418
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:37,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. It's been long abandoned, maybe even before...</font>

419
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:40,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">Radek?</font>

420
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">Radek!</font>

421
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">Radek!</font>

422
00:34:44,498 --> 00:34:45,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's got my bag!</font>

423
00:34:45,791 --> 00:34:47,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">Radek!</font>

424
00:34:49,753 --> 00:34:52,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something's got my bag!</font>

425
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:53,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no!</font>

426
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:55,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's got my bag!</font>

427
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:02,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Help me with her!
- What's going on?</font>

428
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:05,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, grab my shoulder!</font>

429
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:10,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get her. Come on.</font>

430
00:35:11,983 --> 00:35:13,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got her.</font>

431
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:14,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay</font>

432
00:35:14,903 --> 00:35:16,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got her. Okay.</font>

433
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:17,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're good, you're good.</font>

434
00:35:18,532 --> 00:35:19,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay.</font>

435
00:35:26,206 --> 00:35:28,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's sit you down.
Help me with her bag.</font>

436
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:31,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, just breathe.
It's okay. You're just fine.</font>

437
00:35:31,211 --> 00:35:33,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What the hell happened?
- Something in the water.</font>

438
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:46,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get up, get up. Go.</font>

439
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:58,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, shit! Get back.</font>

440
00:36:03,034 --> 00:36:05,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sheppard! Sheppard, watch out!</font>

441
00:36:09,291 --> 00:36:11,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">Holy fuck!</font>

442
00:36:52,626 --> 00:36:53,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa.</font>

443
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:57,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's exactly the same as the flowers.</font>

444
00:36:59,007 --> 00:37:00,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at the teeth.</font>

445
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:03,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">Concentric rows.</font>

446
00:37:04,012 --> 00:37:06,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something here is making giant waves in the gene pool.</font>

447
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:09,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sharks have teeth like that, don't they?</font>

448
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:11,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think it's a crossbreed?</font>

449
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:15,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't crossbreed between different species.</font>

450
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lena, this is getting heavy.</font>

451
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:33,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">The mutations were subtle at first.</font>

452
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:37,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">More extreme as we grew closer to the lighthouse.</font>

453
00:37:39,047 --> 00:37:41,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Corruptions of form.</font>

454
00:37:42,342 --> 00:37:44,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">Duplicates of form.</font>

455
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">Duplicates?</font>

456
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:49,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Echoes.</font>

457
00:37:54,271 --> 00:37:56,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it possible these were hallucinations?</font>

458
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:01,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wondered that myself.</font>

459
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:04,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">But they were shared among all of us.</font>

460
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was dreamlike.</font>

461
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:11,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nightmarish.</font>

462
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not always.</font>

463
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes it was beautiful.</font>

464
00:38:41,818 --> 00:38:43,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ow.</font>

465
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:46,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">You hurt?</font>

466
00:38:47,657 --> 00:38:49,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just a bruise.</font>

467
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:52,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">Must have gotten that from the gator.</font>

468
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:54,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

469
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:01,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, where'd you learn to shoot?</font>

470
00:39:03,423 --> 00:39:05,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was in the military before I was an academic.</font>

471
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:07,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">Marines?</font>

472
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:09,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Army. Seven years.</font>

473
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">Feels like a lifetime ago now.</font>

474
00:39:12,932 --> 00:39:13,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

475
00:39:15,393 --> 00:39:17,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">All other lives feel like a lifetime ago.</font>

476
00:39:18,396 --> 00:39:20,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were kids, I was married.</font>

477
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:25,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which do you carry around your neck?
A husband or a child?</font>

478
00:39:25,737 --> 00:39:26,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Husband.</font>

479
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was in the army, too.
That's...</font>

480
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:32,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">that's how we met.</font>

481
00:39:33,286 --> 00:39:34,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Was" in the army? He quit?</font>

482
00:39:36,331 --> 00:39:37,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">KIA.</font>

483
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry to hear that.</font>

484
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guess there had to be something.</font>

485
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:45,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you mean?</font>

486
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:50,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">Volunteering for... this.</font>

487
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:54,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not exactly something you do if your life is in... perfect harmony.</font>

488
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:58,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're all damaged goods here.</font>

489
00:39:59,938 --> 00:40:01,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anya is sober...</font>

490
00:40:01,856 --> 00:40:03,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">therefore an addict.</font>

491
00:40:03,483 --> 00:40:05,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">Josie wears long sleeves</font>

492
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:08,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">'cause she doesn't want you to see the scars on her forearms.</font>

493
00:40:08,405 --> 00:40:10,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's tried to kill herself?</font>

494
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:13,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I think the opposite, trying to feel alive.</font>

495
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:17,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ventress?</font>

496
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:21,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. As far as anyone knows...</font>

497
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:26,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">no friends, no family, no partner, no children.</font>

498
00:40:27,215 --> 00:40:29,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">No concession in her at all.</font>

499
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:35,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You?
- I also lost someone.</font>

500
00:40:37,934 --> 00:40:39,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not a husband, though, um...</font>

501
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:42,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">A daughter. Leukemia.</font>

502
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">God, I'm sorry.</font>

503
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:46,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">In a way, it's two bereavements.</font>

504
00:40:49,237 --> 00:40:51,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">My... beautiful girl...</font>

505
00:40:53,867 --> 00:40:55,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the person I once was.</font>

506
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, hey!</font>

507
00:40:57,454 --> 00:40:58,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got something here.</font>

508
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:33,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">This used to be the headquarters of the Southern Reach.</font>

509
00:41:34,407 --> 00:41:35,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">Before the Shimmer swallowed it.</font>

510
00:41:39,621 --> 00:41:40,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">More mutations.</font>

511
00:41:41,998 --> 00:41:43,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're everywhere.</font>

512
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:45,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Malignant.</font>

513
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:47,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like tumors.</font>

514
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that the old mess hall?</font>

515
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:51,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

516
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:54,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's billet there. Come on.</font>

517
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:32,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's beds and bags.
You think people are here?</font>

518
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:35,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">Were here.</font>

519
00:42:36,177 --> 00:42:38,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I'm gonna go with the past tense.</font>

520
00:42:58,909 --> 00:42:59,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn.</font>

521
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:04,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

522
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:07,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, shit.</font>

523
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:19,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">This shit is heavy. Can't carry this.</font>

524
00:43:36,487 --> 00:43:37,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lena, what you got going on?</font>

525
00:43:39,824 --> 00:43:41,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guys, check this out.</font>

526
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:45,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Peyton, Mayer...</font>

527
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kane, Shelley."</font>

528
00:43:50,376 --> 00:43:52,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those were the soldiers on the last expedition.</font>

529
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:55,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like they were using this room as their base of operations.</font>

530
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are some of the names crossed out?</font>

531
00:43:57,717 --> 00:43:59,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's not jump to conclusions.</font>

532
00:43:59,427 --> 00:44:01,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I don't know, maybe we should.
- Yeah.</font>

533
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:05,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This is the plan view of the base right?
- Yep. This is the mess hall.</font>

534
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:07,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's the building right?
- Yep.</font>

535
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:10,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think that the times by the names are a guard rota, so...</font>

536
00:44:10,938 --> 00:44:12,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">if they were guarding the perimeter, we should too.</font>

537
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:14,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Copy that.
- Yep.</font>

538
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:29,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">This might be able to tell us something.</font>

539
00:44:33,503 --> 00:44:35,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">"For those that follow."</font>

540
00:44:36,798 --> 00:44:39,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe that means us.</font>

541
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:49,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">Memory card.</font>

542
00:44:52,063 --> 00:44:53,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should be able to play this.</font>

543
00:45:01,447 --> 00:45:02,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's working.</font>

544
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:08,621
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>All right?</i></font>

545
00:45:13,668 --> 00:45:15,420
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- Okay?</i>
<i>- Okay.</i></font>

546
00:45:15,878 --> 00:45:16,713
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Okay.</i></font>

547
00:45:26,931 --> 00:45:28,976
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.</i></font>

548
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:30,811
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- Okay. Okay.</i>
<i>- Yeah?</i></font>

549
00:45:30,893 --> 00:45:32,311
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Okay.</i></font>

550
00:45:45,867 --> 00:45:46,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shit.</font>

551
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:49,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is he doing?</font>

552
00:45:57,253 --> 00:45:59,797
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Stop. Stop. Stop, stop, stop.</i></font>

553
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,967
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Hold him. Hold him down.</i></font>

554
00:46:05,052 --> 00:46:06,847
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Oh, yeah. Yeah.</i></font>

555
00:46:06,929 --> 00:46:08,264
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>There. There.</i></font>

556
00:46:24,989 --> 00:46:28,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, so we know what happened to the last group.
They went insane.</font>

557
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">- There was something alive inside that man.
- No.</font>

558
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:33,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That was a trick of the light.
- What?</font>

559
00:46:33,414 --> 00:46:36,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been a paramedic for 10 years, alright.
I've scraped people off the road.</font>

560
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:39,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see some weird shit.
That... that was a trick of the light.</font>

561
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:41,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">- His insides were moving.
- No, it was shock, Radek.</font>

562
00:46:42,048 --> 00:46:44,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That was a shock response.
- Watch it again.</font>

563
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:46,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I'm not gonna fucking watch it again!</font>

564
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:48,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was not intestines.
It was like a... a worm...</font>

565
00:46:48,137 --> 00:46:50,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, then you watch it, Sheppard!</font>

566
00:46:54,519 --> 00:46:55,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are you going?</font>

567
00:47:09,909 --> 00:47:11,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where'd she go?
- Just ahead.</font>

568
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:09,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it?</font>

569
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:11,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

570
00:48:29,822 --> 00:48:32,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I don't want to stay here tonight.
- We don't have a choice.</font>

571
00:48:34,619 --> 00:48:36,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Please.
- Come on.</font>

572
00:48:36,329 --> 00:48:39,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's too late in the day for us to move on.</font>

573
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:41,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, let's go outside.</font>

574
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:24,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that's nice of you.</font>

575
00:49:27,547 --> 00:49:29,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why aren't you here?</font>

576
00:49:31,592 --> 00:49:33,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">I gotta leave a day early.</font>

577
00:49:33,887 --> 00:49:34,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

578
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:37,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, today?</font>

579
00:49:39,016 --> 00:49:41,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Right now.
- Oh, shit.</font>

580
00:49:41,603 --> 00:49:43,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we had a whole day planned.</font>

581
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:45,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We were gonna drive to the country...
- No, we can't.</font>

582
00:49:46,190 --> 00:49:48,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We can't.
- Can you at least...?</font>

583
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:55,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now means right now.</font>

584
00:49:58,954 --> 00:49:59,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

585
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:04,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it?</font>

586
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:12,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do...</font>

587
00:50:16,637 --> 00:50:17,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">love you...</font>

588
00:50:18,681 --> 00:50:19,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lena.</font>

589
00:50:22,059 --> 00:50:23,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love you, too.</font>

590
00:51:20,409 --> 00:51:21,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

591
00:51:23,538 --> 00:51:24,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">The mystery unraveling?</font>

592
00:51:26,791 --> 00:51:28,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something's unraveling.</font>

593
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:31,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you're doing okay.</font>

594
00:51:33,547 --> 00:51:35,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's good Josie's getting some rest.</font>

595
00:51:35,132 --> 00:51:35,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

596
00:51:36,342 --> 00:51:38,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">With the help of a little sedative.</font>

597
00:51:38,302 --> 00:51:40,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">How about you? Get some sleep?</font>

598
00:51:41,597 --> 00:51:42,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some.</font>

599
00:51:43,557 --> 00:51:45,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm at least as freaked as Josie.</font>

600
00:51:47,353 --> 00:51:48,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just hiding it better.</font>

601
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:54,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should check on Ventress.</font>

602
00:51:55,987 --> 00:51:56,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yep.</font>

603
00:52:28,811 --> 00:52:31,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">What're you doing up?
Not supposed to relieve me until 3:00.</font>

604
00:52:31,313 --> 00:52:33,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm done sleeping for the night.</font>

605
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:34,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

606
00:52:36,652 --> 00:52:37,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come look at this.</font>

607
00:52:41,282 --> 00:52:42,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, this is where we are...</font>

608
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:45,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">and that's the lighthouse.</font>

609
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:48,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">Southwest is Ville Perdu.</font>

610
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:50,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a small community we evacuated two years ago.</font>

611
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:54,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think we should head there tomorrow,</font>

612
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:57,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then head out for the coast the following morning.</font>

613
00:53:01,135 --> 00:53:01,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good.</font>

614
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:08,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">You okay?</font>

615
00:53:14,648 --> 00:53:16,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was gonna say, when...</font>

616
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:19,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">you didn't tell the team about your connection to Kane,</font>

617
00:53:19,403 --> 00:53:21,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wasn't sure if that was a good idea.</font>

618
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:25,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">But after seeing that footage...</font>

619
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:30,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">yeah.</font>

620
00:53:30,956 --> 00:53:33,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not sure how they would have reacted to you.</font>

621
00:53:36,253 --> 00:53:38,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why did my husband volunteer for a suicide mission?</font>

622
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:40,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that what you think we're doing?</font>

623
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:43,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Committing suicide?
- You must have profiled him,</font>

624
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:45,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">you must have assessed him.</font>

625
00:53:46,639 --> 00:53:48,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">He must have said something.</font>

626
00:53:49,684 --> 00:53:51,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you're asking me as a psychologist.</font>

627
00:53:53,688 --> 00:53:54,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

628
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:57,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then, as a psychologist...</font>

629
00:53:58,693 --> 00:54:02,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd say you're confusing suicide with self-destruction.</font>

630
00:54:04,782 --> 00:54:07,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">Almost none of us commit suicide...</font>

631
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:10,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">and almost all of us self-destruct.</font>

632
00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:12,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">In some way, in some part of our lives.</font>

633
00:54:14,291 --> 00:54:16,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">We drink, or we smoke.</font>

634
00:54:17,378 --> 00:54:19,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">We destabilize the good job.</font>

635
00:54:21,882 --> 00:54:23,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or the happy marriage.</font>

636
00:54:28,472 --> 00:54:30,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">These aren't decisions, they're...</font>

637
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:32,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">they're impulses.</font>

638
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:37,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">In fact, you're probably better equipped to explain this than I am.</font>

639
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:39,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">What does that mean?</font>

640
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:41,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a biologist.</font>

641
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:45,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Isn't self-destruction coded into us?</font>

642
00:54:45,447 --> 00:54:46,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">Programmed into each cell?</font>

643
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:50,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">What was that?</font>

644
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:52,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't know.</font>

645
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:05,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">Josie, wake up.</font>

646
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:07,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wake up, Josie, come on.
Wake up. Something's happening.</font>

647
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:10,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do you see anything?
- No.</font>

648
00:55:10,514 --> 00:55:12,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened? I heard a noise.</font>

649
00:55:13,559 --> 00:55:14,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh.
- What?</font>

650
00:55:17,646 --> 00:55:19,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something's come through the fence.</font>

651
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">- <i>Through</i> the fence?
- It's ripped open like a fucking zipper.</font>

652
00:55:28,365 --> 00:55:29,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't see anything.</font>

653
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:30,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, neither can I.</font>

654
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:34,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sheppard!</font>

655
00:55:34,204 --> 00:55:35,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sheppard!</font>

656
00:55:35,914 --> 00:55:37,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Fuck!
- What's going on?</font>

657
00:55:37,958 --> 00:55:39,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sheppard was next to me.
Something took her.</font>

658
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:43,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck! Sheppard!</font>

659
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:44,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, shit!</font>

660
00:55:44,923 --> 00:55:48,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help! Help me!</font>

661
00:55:52,014 --> 00:55:53,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shepp...</font>

662
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:57,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sheppard!</font>

663
00:56:02,358 --> 00:56:03,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sheppard!</font>

664
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:34,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to go back.</font>

665
00:56:34,807 --> 00:56:37,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We have to go back now.
- She's right.</font>

666
00:56:37,309 --> 00:56:39,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right? In what sense?</font>

667
00:56:39,144 --> 00:56:40,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've been attacked twice.</font>

668
00:56:40,855 --> 00:56:42,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">We lost one of our own.</font>

669
00:56:42,815 --> 00:56:45,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have evidence the previous team went nuts and chopped each other up.</font>

670
00:56:46,027 --> 00:56:48,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">I... I really don't know how much more right she has to be.</font>

671
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:50,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">We haven't reached the lighthouse.</font>

672
00:56:50,239 --> 00:56:53,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">We still don't understand the cause or the nature of the Shimmer.</font>

673
00:56:53,242 --> 00:56:55,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have data, observations, photographs.
She has hella footage.</font>

674
00:56:55,786 --> 00:56:59,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">All of which makes the phenomenon less explicable, not more.</font>

675
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna get to the lighthouse,</font>

676
00:57:03,836 --> 00:57:05,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'm fine going on my own.</font>

677
00:57:05,838 --> 00:57:10,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just need to decide... whether you're coming with me or not.</font>

678
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:24,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like she hasn't noticed that Sheppard is dead.</font>

679
00:57:24,398 --> 00:57:25,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's crazy.</font>

680
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:27,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's a crazy old bitch.</font>

681
00:57:28,735 --> 00:57:31,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, and thanks for the fucking backup, Lena.</font>

682
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:34,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I didn't realize there were sides.
- Yeah.</font>

683
00:57:35,117 --> 00:57:36,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, there are sides.</font>

684
00:57:37,369 --> 00:57:40,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, then I agree with you.
We should go back.</font>

685
00:57:41,081 --> 00:57:43,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good. Okay, great. There we go. Okay?</font>

686
00:57:43,208 --> 00:57:45,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So the three of us can...
- Hold on a minute. Hold on.</font>

687
00:57:45,586 --> 00:57:46,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should go back, yes.</font>

688
00:57:47,045 --> 00:57:49,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it took us, what, six days to get here?</font>

689
00:57:49,590 --> 00:57:51,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the coast is two days away.</font>

690
00:57:52,927 --> 00:57:55,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">And as Sheppard said...</font>

691
00:57:56,347 --> 00:57:59,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">when we get to the coast, we can follow it until we hit the perimeter wall.</font>

692
00:58:00,184 --> 00:58:01,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're saying we get out by going deeper in?</font>

693
00:58:02,686 --> 00:58:04,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, if you like, yeah.
- "Like"?</font>

694
00:58:05,063 --> 00:58:07,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I don't fucking "like."</font>

695
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:14,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">This isn't some bullshit tactic to get us to the lighthouse, is it?</font>

696
00:58:14,865 --> 00:58:17,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is not about the lighthouse, okay?</font>

697
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:20,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe that the coast is the best route out.</font>

698
00:58:24,833 --> 00:58:25,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay?</font>

699
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:40,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">You lied to them.</font>

700
00:58:43,644 --> 00:58:45,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't know what going back meant.</font>

701
00:58:46,396 --> 00:58:48,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why it would be safer than going forward.</font>

702
00:58:50,108 --> 00:58:53,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">You didn't know, but you made a decision to continue as if you did.</font>

703
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:55,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ventress made the decision.</font>

704
00:58:55,364 --> 00:58:58,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ventress had cancer.
She was never coming back.</font>

705
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:00,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">You knew she was sick.</font>

706
00:59:01,746 --> 00:59:02,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had guessed.</font>

707
00:59:06,083 --> 00:59:07,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you wanted to continue.</font>

708
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:10,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

709
00:59:12,173 --> 00:59:13,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did.</font>

710
01:00:00,346 --> 01:00:01,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">She could still be alive.</font>

711
01:00:01,972 --> 01:00:03,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's highly doubtful.</font>

712
01:00:05,226 --> 01:00:06,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to know.</font>

713
01:00:09,356 --> 01:00:10,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go.</font>

714
01:00:11,233 --> 01:00:12,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine.</font>

715
01:00:14,818 --> 01:00:15,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm coming with you.</font>

716
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:18,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll go alone.</font>

717
01:02:47,429 --> 01:02:48,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you find her?</font>

718
01:02:49,306 --> 01:02:50,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

719
01:02:51,641 --> 01:02:52,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's dead.</font>

720
01:03:17,501 --> 01:03:18,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">You okay?</font>

721
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:22,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine. Just... leave me the fuck alone.</font>

722
01:03:49,074 --> 01:03:50,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll camp here tonight.</font>

723
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:54,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's another two hours' walk up the coast.</font>

724
01:04:32,159 --> 01:04:33,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">They've grown this way.</font>

725
01:04:34,786 --> 01:04:36,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">That doesn't make any sense.</font>

726
01:04:37,081 --> 01:04:38,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think it does.</font>

727
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:51,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">At first I thought the radio waves were blocked by the Shimmer,</font>

728
01:04:51,219 --> 01:04:55,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">and that's why no one inside could communicate with base or GPS,</font>

729
01:04:55,432 --> 01:05:00,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">but the light waves aren't blocked, they're refracted, and...</font>

730
01:05:05,483 --> 01:05:07,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's the same with the radios.</font>

731
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:09,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">The signals aren't gone.</font>

732
01:05:10,072 --> 01:05:11,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're scrambled.</font>

733
01:05:17,663 --> 01:05:19,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">That leaf in your hand...</font>

734
01:05:20,373 --> 01:05:22,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">do you know what you'd get if you sequenced it?</font>

735
01:05:23,085 --> 01:05:25,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- Human Hox genes.</font>

736
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:27,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hox? What is... what's Hox mean?</font>

737
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:31,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're the genes that define the body plan, the physical structure.</font>

738
01:05:34,096 --> 01:05:36,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the plants have human body plan.</font>

739
01:05:36,306 --> 01:05:40,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Arms attached to shoulders. Legs to hips.</font>

740
01:05:40,853 --> 01:05:42,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's literally not possible.</font>

741
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:44,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's literally what's happening.</font>

742
01:05:46,983 --> 01:05:50,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Shimmer is a prism, but it refracts everything.</font>

743
01:05:51,489 --> 01:05:53,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not just light and radio waves.</font>

744
01:05:54,449 --> 01:05:57,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Animal DNA, plant DNA...</font>

745
01:05:58,704 --> 01:06:00,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">all DNA.</font>

746
01:06:00,539 --> 01:06:01,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you mean, "all DNA"?</font>

747
01:06:02,875 --> 01:06:04,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's talking about our DNA.</font>

748
01:06:07,505 --> 01:06:08,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's talking about us.</font>

749
01:07:15,530 --> 01:07:18,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right... I guess this is a bedroom.</font>

750
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:21,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's secure doors and windows.</font>

751
01:08:47,288 --> 01:08:48,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">This was a mistake.</font>

752
01:08:51,292 --> 01:08:52,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

753
01:08:58,926 --> 01:09:01,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">You spend more time away from your husband than with him.</font>

754
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:06,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't talk to him about work, and he won't talk to you about his.</font>

755
01:09:06,975 --> 01:09:10,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">And there is a clear physical and intellectual connection between us.</font>

756
01:09:11,063 --> 01:09:13,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Have I covered the bases?
- You forgot to mention your wife.</font>

757
01:09:13,231 --> 01:09:14,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love my wife.</font>

758
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:18,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's blameless in this.</font>

759
01:09:27,328 --> 01:09:28,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, Lena.</font>

760
01:09:29,957 --> 01:09:31,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's really going on here?</font>

761
01:09:33,668 --> 01:09:36,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think that something may have happened to him?</font>

762
01:09:41,051 --> 01:09:42,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or you think he knows.</font>

763
01:09:45,264 --> 01:09:46,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's it, isn't it?</font>

764
01:09:47,265 --> 01:09:49,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think somehow he's found out about our affair.</font>

765
01:09:52,104 --> 01:09:53,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">Has he found out?</font>

766
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:55,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

767
01:09:59,069 --> 01:09:59,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should go.</font>

768
01:10:02,448 --> 01:10:03,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, Lena, I...
- Dan...</font>

769
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:08,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not interested in talking... or in anything you have to say.</font>

770
01:10:10,038 --> 01:10:11,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just get dressed and get out.</font>

771
01:10:14,376 --> 01:10:17,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, it's not me you hate, it's yourself.</font>

772
01:10:20,506 --> 01:10:21,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Dan, it's you, too.</font>

773
01:10:26,137 --> 01:10:27,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's never gonna happen again.</font>

774
01:10:34,104 --> 01:10:35,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">You lying bitch!</font>

775
01:10:36,814 --> 01:10:38,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's going on?
- No.</font>

776
01:10:39,275 --> 01:10:42,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't get to ask that fucking question.
You answer it!</font>

777
01:11:11,725 --> 01:11:12,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brother.</font>

778
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:15,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boyfriend.</font>

779
01:11:17,981 --> 01:11:18,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">Husband.</font>

780
01:11:22,903 --> 01:11:24,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">Husband.</font>

781
01:11:26,364 --> 01:11:29,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why didn't you tell us?</font>

782
01:11:30,661 --> 01:11:33,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know. Obviously.</font>

783
01:11:37,877 --> 01:11:40,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you know?</font>

784
01:11:42,588 --> 01:11:44,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

785
01:11:49,220 --> 01:11:51,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, there are two theories of what went wrong.</font>

786
01:11:51,347 --> 01:11:52,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">And assume one is that something in here killed them.
Two...</font>

787
01:11:53,057 --> 01:11:56,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">is that they went crazy and they killed each other.</font>

788
01:11:58,730 --> 01:12:00,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Josie nearly got killed by an alligator,</font>

789
01:12:00,983 --> 01:12:03,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">and Cass did get killed by a bear.</font>

790
01:12:06,113 --> 01:12:08,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, yes, theory one, it fits.</font>

791
01:12:11,452 --> 01:12:12,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">But...</font>

792
01:12:15,247 --> 01:12:16,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't actually see a bear.</font>

793
01:12:18,458 --> 01:12:19,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">And neither did Josie.</font>

794
01:12:20,793 --> 01:12:22,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">The only people who saw were Lena and Ventress.</font>

795
01:12:23,463 --> 01:12:26,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">So nothing's confirmed.
Everything's on their word.</font>

796
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:30,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything's on Lena's word.</font>

797
01:12:31,262 --> 01:12:32,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what we know now...</font>

798
01:12:34,140 --> 01:12:37,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">what we know,</font>

799
01:12:37,394 --> 01:12:40,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">is that Lena... is a liar.</font>

800
01:12:40,730 --> 01:12:42,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut the fuck up!</font>

801
01:12:44,484 --> 01:12:48,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lena... you're a liar.</font>

802
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:52,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you kill Cass?</font>

803
01:12:54,994 --> 01:12:56,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you lose your shit?</font>

804
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:02,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or do you think I've lost my shit and I was gonna fuck each other up?</font>

805
01:13:02,502 --> 01:13:03,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's theory two.</font>

806
01:13:09,635 --> 01:13:10,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God.</font>

807
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:17,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I look at my hands...</font>

808
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:19,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">and my fingerprints...</font>

809
01:13:21,438 --> 01:13:22,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can see them moving.</font>

810
01:13:24,109 --> 01:13:24,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me go.</font>

811
01:13:27,909 --> 01:13:29,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't.</font>

812
01:13:30,113 --> 01:13:31,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I let you go,</font>

813
01:13:32,073 --> 01:13:34,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you tie me to a chair and cut me open...</font>

814
01:13:36,494 --> 01:13:39,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">are my insides gonna move like my fingerprints?</font>

815
01:13:47,381 --> 01:13:51,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">But... I'm not the one tied to a chair.</font>

816
01:13:55,430 --> 01:13:56,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are.</font>

817
01:14:01,353 --> 01:14:03,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help me!</font>

818
01:14:06,149 --> 01:14:07,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help me!</font>

819
01:14:07,900 --> 01:14:09,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help me!</font>

820
01:14:09,778 --> 01:14:11,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Cass?</font>

821
01:14:14,365 --> 01:14:16,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said she was dead.</font>

822
01:14:16,993 --> 01:14:19,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cass! Cass, I'm coming!</font>

823
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:23,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cass, is that you?</font>

824
01:15:06,877 --> 01:15:11,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help me! Help me!</font>

825
01:15:12,673 --> 01:15:15,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help!</font>

826
01:15:29,608 --> 01:15:30,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't react.</font>

827
01:15:31,443 --> 01:15:32,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm.</font>

828
01:15:38,283 --> 01:15:41,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me!</font>

829
01:16:07,645 --> 01:16:11,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help!</font>

830
01:16:24,037 --> 01:16:25,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me!</font>

831
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:38,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! No!</font>

832
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:40,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

833
01:16:58,195 --> 01:17:00,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me!</font>

834
01:17:14,546 --> 01:17:18,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help... me...</font>

835
01:17:42,365 --> 01:17:43,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

836
01:17:44,201 --> 01:17:46,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm leaving.
- Now?</font>

837
01:17:48,579 --> 01:17:51,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's not even light yet.
- I don't have time to wait.</font>

838
01:17:51,625 --> 01:17:53,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are disintegrating.</font>

839
01:17:53,335 --> 01:17:55,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our bodies as fast as our minds.
Can't you feel it?</font>

840
01:17:57,130 --> 01:17:59,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like the onset of dementia.</font>

841
01:18:02,094 --> 01:18:03,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I don't reach the lighthouse soon...</font>

842
01:18:04,470 --> 01:18:07,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">the person that started this journey won't be the person that ends it.</font>

843
01:18:08,225 --> 01:18:10,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to be the one that ends it.</font>

844
01:19:12,497 --> 01:19:13,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should go, Josie.</font>

845
01:19:21,922 --> 01:19:24,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long was your husband in the Shimmer?</font>

846
01:19:26,219 --> 01:19:28,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's hard to say exactly.</font>

847
01:19:31,099 --> 01:19:33,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">Theoretically, as long as a year.</font>

848
01:19:35,645 --> 01:19:38,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a long time to be inside and remain intact.</font>

849
01:19:39,815 --> 01:19:41,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not so sure he was intact.</font>

850
01:19:45,988 --> 01:19:46,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm right...</font>

851
01:19:48,365 --> 01:19:52,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">- about the refractions... aren't I?
- Yeah.</font>

852
01:19:52,828 --> 01:19:54,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">I checked my blood last night.</font>

853
01:19:57,292 --> 01:19:59,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's... in me.</font>

854
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:04,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">It will be in all of us.</font>

855
01:20:11,055 --> 01:20:12,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was so strange hearing...</font>

856
01:20:13,766 --> 01:20:17,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sheppard's voice in the mouth of that creature last night.</font>

857
01:20:18,395 --> 01:20:21,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think as she was dying, part of her mind became...</font>

858
01:20:22,399 --> 01:20:24,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">part of the creature that was killing her.</font>

859
01:20:26,738 --> 01:20:29,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">Imagine dying frightened and in pain,</font>

860
01:20:29,490 --> 01:20:32,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">and having that as the only part of you which survives.</font>

861
01:20:34,203 --> 01:20:35,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wouldn't like that at all.</font>

862
01:20:56,685 --> 01:20:58,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ventress wants to face it.</font>

863
01:20:59,229 --> 01:21:00,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to fight it.</font>

864
01:21:02,274 --> 01:21:05,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I don't think I want either of those things.</font>

865
01:21:12,533 --> 01:21:13,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">Josie.</font>

866
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:22,043

869
01:22:00,289 --> 01:22:01,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you explain that?</font>

870
01:22:05,712 --> 01:22:07,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it something I need to explain?</font>

871
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:09,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, you do.</font>

872
01:22:16,597 --> 01:22:17,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had to come back.</font>

873
01:22:19,809 --> 01:22:21,560

01:32:27,917 --> 01:32:29,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know what it wants.</font>

920
01:32:30,293 --> 01:32:31,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or if it wants.</font>

921
01:32:32,630 --> 01:32:33,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it will grow...</font>

922
01:32:34,422 --> 01:32:36,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">until it encompasses everything.</font>

923
01:32:39,636 --> 01:32:40,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our bodies and our minds</font>

924
01:32:40,805 --> 01:32:44,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">will be fragmented into their smallest parts until...</font>

925
01:32:44,850 --> 01:32:46,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">not one part remains.</font>

926
01:32:51,565 --> 01:32:53,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annihilation.</font>

927
01:35:47,533 --> 01:35:49,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no. No!</font>

928
01:44:12,203 --> 01:44:13,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">So it was alien.</font>

929
01:44:20,671 --> 01:44:22,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you describe its form?</font>

930
01:44:27,094 --> 01:44:27,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

931
01:44:28,970 --> 01:44:30,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was it carbon-based...?</font>

932
01:44:34,725 --> 01:44:35,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

933
01:44:38,479 --> 01:44:39,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did it want?</font>

934
01:44:41,399 --> 01:44:43,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think it wanted anything.</font>

935
01:44:43,859 --> 01:44:46,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it... it attacked you.</font>

936
01:44:47,322 --> 01:44:48,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">It mirrored me.</font>

937
01:44:49,699 --> 01:44:50,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">I attacked it.</font>

938
01:44:52,411 --> 01:44:54,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not sure it even knew I was there.</font>

939
01:44:54,537 --> 01:44:56,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">It came here for a reason.</font>

940
01:44:57,541 --> 01:45:01,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was mutating our environment, it was destroying everything.</font>

941
01:45:02,503 --> 01:45:04,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">It wasn't destroying.</font>

942
01:45:06,050 --> 01:45:08,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was changing everything.</font>

943
01:45:08,885 --> 01:45:10,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was making something new.</font>

944
01:45:14,015 --> 01:45:14,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Making what?</font>

945
01:45:23,274 --> 01:45:24,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

946
01:45:28,738 --> 01:45:31,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">A team reached the lighthouse a few hours ago.</font>

947
01:45:32,658 --> 01:45:34,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything is ash.</font>

948
01:45:34,953 --> 01:45:38,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">If what you encountered was once alive...</font>

949
01:45:38,957 --> 01:45:40,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">it seems it's now dead.</font>

950
01:46:02,271 --> 01:46:04,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now will you tell me what happened to my husband?</font>

951
01:46:06,568 --> 01:46:08,235
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>When the Shimmer disappeared,</i></font>

952
01:46:08,319 --> 01:46:12,365
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>his blood pressure stabilized and his pulse rate started to rise.</i></font>

953
01:46:13,867 --> 01:46:15,993
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>A few hours later, he was not only awake,</i></font>

954
01:46:16,078 --> 01:46:17,162
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>he was lucid.</i></font>

955
01:46:18,829 --> 01:46:20,916
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>He's still in isolation, obviously.</i></font>

956
01:46:22,376 --> 01:46:23,377
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>So am I.</i></font>

957
01:47:07,546 --> 01:47:08,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">You aren't Kane...</font>

958
01:47:10,506 --> 01:47:11,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">are you?</font>

959
01:47:18,055 --> 01:47:19,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think so.</font>

960
01:47:27,606 --> 01:47:28,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you Lena?</font>
