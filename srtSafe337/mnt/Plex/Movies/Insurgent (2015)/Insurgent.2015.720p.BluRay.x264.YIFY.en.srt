<font color="#FFFFFF">Peace</font>

3
00:01:04,013 --> 00:01:05,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">Long ago,</font>

4
00:01:05,075 --> 00:01:08,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">before the founders established this great city of ours</font>

5
00:01:08,664 --> 00:01:14,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">that word was all but meaningless,
an ideal as elusive as a dream.</font>

6
00:01:15,105 --> 00:01:17,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, 200 years later</font>

7
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:21,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are all of us living proof that peace is indeed attainable.</font>

8
00:01:22,454 --> 00:01:25,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">The reason for this is of course are faction system.</font>

9
00:01:26,096 --> 00:01:30,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">Erudite, Dauntless, Amity, Candor, Abnegation</font>

10
00:01:31,099 --> 00:01:34,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">In dividing people according to personality and attitude</font>

11
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:38,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">we've created a society in which each faction plays a critical role</font>

12
00:01:39,112 --> 00:01:40,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">in maintaining the social order.</font>

13
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:47,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">But this harmony we achieved is now under attack from
a small but extremely dangerous group of individuals</font>

14
00:01:47,384 --> 00:01:50,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">We call them "Divergents".</font>

15
00:01:50,521 --> 00:01:54,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">They are in essence the worst of what humanity used to be</font>

16
00:01:55,346 --> 00:01:59,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">rebellious, defious, and uncontrollable.</font>

17
00:01:59,841 --> 00:02:07,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">Five days ago, a rogue group of divergents posing as
Dauntless brutely invaded Abnegation</font>

18
00:02:07,033 --> 00:02:11,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">in an obvious attempt to cripple the faction system
by attacking it's most vulnerble members.</font>

19
00:02:13,283 --> 00:02:18,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">These divergents despise our system because
they are incapable of conforming to it.</font>

20
00:02:18,478 --> 00:02:22,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">These latest rumours for example that I was somehow
behind the attack on abnegation</font>

21
00:02:22,563 --> 00:02:26,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">is nothing more that divergent propaganda</font>

22
00:02:26,277 --> 00:02:31,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have devoted myself to bringing to bringing these fugitives to justice.</font>

23
00:02:31,847 --> 00:02:35,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've exercised my right as acting council leader to declare martial law</font>

24
00:02:35,019 --> 00:02:39,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">until im confident that any threat to our security has been elimintated.</font>

25
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:42,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell Jeanine that we got it.</font>

26
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are all that's left of humanity.</font>

27
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:49,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">The vast wall that encloses this city</font>

28
00:02:49,223 --> 00:02:53,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">may protect us from our toxic surroundings,</font>

29
00:02:53,358 --> 00:02:57,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it is up to us to confront any element
that can poison us from within.</font>

30
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:03,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because when you are civilisations last hope
peace is not merely an ideal</font>

31
00:03:03,098 --> 00:03:05,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">its an obligation.</font>

32
00:03:05,354 --> 00:03:10,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it is up to all us to take a stand position against it's one true enemy.</font>

33
00:03:11,353 --> 00:03:12,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Divergents.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Amity!</font>

36
00:03:48,807 --> 00:03:50,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should make sure it's clear.</font>

37
00:03:52,004 --> 00:03:53,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tris!</font>

38
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:13,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help us, help us, please!</font>

39
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:17,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please help us, you have to help us!</font>

40
00:04:17,528 --> 00:04:20,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, you have to leave.</font>

41
00:04:20,653 --> 00:04:24,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You just don't belong here.
- Its all her fault.</font>

42
00:04:29,588 --> 00:04:31,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">You killed Will.</font>

43
00:04:32,627 --> 00:04:33,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">No...</font>

44
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:35,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">She killed ...</font>

45
00:04:45,154 --> 00:04:46,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mom!</font>

46
00:04:50,168 --> 00:04:53,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've killed us all.</font>

47
00:06:46,577 --> 00:06:50,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">And... Three! Higher!</font>

48
00:06:52,603 --> 00:06:56,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Higher, higher!
- Are you alright?</font>

49
00:06:56,057 --> 00:06:58,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay everyone back to you classroom</font>

50
00:07:13,197 --> 00:07:15,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just wanted to do something different.</font>

51
00:07:16,641 --> 00:07:17,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

52
00:07:30,521 --> 00:07:32,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well that's definitely different.</font>

53
00:07:33,593 --> 00:07:37,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You don't like it?
- No, I like it, I like it a lot</font>

54
00:07:38,764 --> 00:07:40,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just surprised, that's all.</font>

55
00:07:42,932 --> 00:07:46,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's going on, Tris?
- Nothing. I'm fine.</font>

56
00:07:46,737 --> 00:07:48,468
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just...</font>

57
00:07:50,353 --> 00:07:52,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Still having nightmares?</font>

58
00:07:54,512 --> 00:07:55,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

59
00:08:01,112 --> 00:08:02,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're good.</font>

60
00:08:04,798 --> 00:08:09,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">You and me. I know nothing else is, but we are.</font>

61
00:08:15,735 --> 00:08:17,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">Time for chores.</font>

62
00:08:32,995 --> 00:08:36,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How much longer do we have to stay here, Four?
- Until we know it's safe to leave.</font>

63
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:09,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey.
- Hey.</font>

64
00:09:10,745 --> 00:09:12,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Son!</font>

65
00:09:15,033 --> 00:09:16,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't ignore me forever.</font>

66
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:22,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you're thinking about your next move,
but there are things you don't know.</font>

67
00:09:22,681 --> 00:09:24,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">Marcus, please just leave us alone.</font>

68
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:29,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your mother didn't come back to abnegation just to save you.</font>

69
00:09:29,181 --> 00:09:32,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">She died trying to hide something from Jeanine
that something entrusted to Abnegation</font>

70
00:09:32,658 --> 00:09:34,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">- long ago.
- Marcus! Stop!</font>

71
00:09:34,671 --> 00:09:37,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever you want from us, you're not gonna get it.</font>

72
00:09:41,131 --> 00:09:43,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not the enemy here.</font>

73
00:09:55,764 --> 00:09:57,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">You found it...</font>

74
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:04,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was in the home of Natalie and Andrew Prior, like you said.</font>

75
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Want to tell me what's inside?</font>

76
00:10:14,484 --> 00:10:18,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">A message from the founders of?
the future our people deserve.</font>

77
00:10:21,745 --> 00:10:28,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">Divergents will destroy our society,
unless we destroy them.</font>

78
00:10:32,246 --> 00:10:34,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now we can.</font>

79
00:10:35,584 --> 00:10:39,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">However, only a divergent can open this box.</font>

80
00:10:44,256 --> 00:10:45,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Find them!</font>

81
00:10:46,658 --> 00:10:48,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every last one of them.</font>

82
00:11:07,129 --> 00:11:09,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go with happiness.</font>

83
00:11:09,722 --> 00:11:11,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go with happiness</font>

84
00:11:12,091 --> 00:11:14,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You with happiness.
- Thank you.</font>

85
00:11:18,634 --> 00:11:20,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go with happiness.</font>

86
00:11:22,013 --> 00:11:25,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">I really don't know how much longer I
can do this whole peace and love thing.</font>

87
00:11:25,557 --> 00:11:27,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the amity way, just try to blend in.</font>

88
00:11:28,219 --> 00:11:31,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm trying to blend in, and its just not working.</font>

89
00:11:31,927 --> 00:11:34,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Coming through, on you right.
Hey here we go.</font>

90
00:11:34,307 --> 00:11:36,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look a rainbow. It's pretty.</font>

91
00:11:37,999 --> 00:11:41,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pathological offendiness along without
questioning passivity. I love this place.</font>

92
00:11:41,346 --> 00:11:43,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you. Go with happiness.</font>

93
00:11:43,812 --> 00:11:47,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oops, Excuse me.
- Hey tris, I really like your hair by the way.</font>

94
00:11:47,682 --> 00:11:49,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you try to cut it all short and weird...</font>

95
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:52,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey Peter, why don't you take your food and sit down?</font>

96
00:11:52,148 --> 00:11:53,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or what?</font>

97
00:11:55,419 --> 00:11:58,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">Besides I think we all should stick together
now that we are officially fugitives.</font>

98
00:11:58,616 --> 00:12:03,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Wait what do you mean by official fugitives?
- You don't know? You did'nt tell Caleb?</font>

99
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yesterday Jeanine announced that the attack on Abnegation</font>

100
00:12:06,773 --> 00:12:10,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">was organized by a group of regenade divergents
And their sympathizers.</font>

101
00:12:10,754 --> 00:12:13,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So they're blaming this whole thing on us?
- Yeah.</font>

102
00:12:13,573 --> 00:12:17,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Jeanine needed a reason to petition to
the council so they could declare martial law.</font>

103
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:19,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now she has one.</font>

104
00:12:28,356 --> 00:12:30,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">Staying here at Amity is the best option for now.</font>

105
00:12:31,687 --> 00:12:34,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to keep an eye of the ground and
find out where the rest of the dauntless are.</font>

106
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:39,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Then we can make a move.
- We need to kill Jeanine.</font>

107
00:12:41,307 --> 00:12:43,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know, we're not ready yet.</font>

108
00:12:48,951 --> 00:12:52,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Beatrice you're not being serious, are you?
- No I am being serious..</font>

109
00:12:53,403 --> 00:12:55,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not gonna stop until she's is dead.</font>

110
00:12:56,407 --> 00:12:59,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Tris you can't just go around and kill people.
- She's right, listen to your sister.</font>

111
00:12:59,995 --> 00:13:03,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tris, I think you should go to eredite and kill Jeanine yourself.</font>

112
00:13:04,236 --> 00:13:06,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will stay with Caleb so they don't kill him too.</font>

113
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

114
00:13:12,539 --> 00:13:13,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">C'mon you know.</font>

115
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:16,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just as she did with your parents.</font>

116
00:13:33,609 --> 00:13:34,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop!</font>

117
00:13:34,911 --> 00:13:37,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you think you're doing?</font>

118
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:42,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">- My office! Now!</font>

119
00:13:44,549 --> 00:13:47,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enjoy your meal everyone, enjoy your meal.</font>

120
00:13:47,729 --> 00:13:49,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, you need to calm down.</font>

121
00:13:56,279 --> 00:14:01,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was I not clear that the terms of your sanctuary here
included non violence?</font>

122
00:14:01,687 --> 00:14:04,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well I can guarantee you nothing like this will ever happen again.</font>

123
00:14:05,989 --> 00:14:09,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be that as it may, you can no longer stay here with us.</font>

124
00:14:09,678 --> 00:14:12,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your presence, it is just too destructive.</font>

125
00:14:15,395 --> 00:14:19,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">The truth is that our sanctuary was never
gonna last very long here anyways.</font>

126
00:14:19,409 --> 00:14:22,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was it?
With you not standing up to Jeanine.</font>

127
00:14:24,607 --> 00:14:27,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You don't understand us at all.
- No I do understand you.</font>

128
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:30,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">I understand that you think you can stay out of this but you can't.</font>

129
00:14:30,461 --> 00:14:35,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">One day she's gonna show up and Jeanine is gonna
take whatever power you think you have away from you.</font>

130
00:14:35,022 --> 00:14:36,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tris! Tris!</font>

131
00:14:39,246 --> 00:14:42,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, Johanna, we need a little more time.</font>

132
00:14:43,629 --> 00:14:46,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to find out where the rest of the Dauntless are, then we can leave.</font>

133
00:14:46,668 --> 00:14:49,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then what? Attack Erudite?</font>

134
00:14:49,326 --> 00:14:53,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I will not be a part to violence.
- No one is asking you to.</font>

135
00:14:53,289 --> 00:14:56,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">We just need a few more days.</font>

136
00:15:00,168 --> 00:15:01,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">One.</font>

137
00:15:03,373 --> 00:15:08,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">- One, what?
- One more chance.</font>

138
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:16,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, to be Amity is to forgive others, and yourself.</font>

139
00:15:17,658 --> 00:15:19,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're hurting Tris.</font>

140
00:15:22,837 --> 00:15:25,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">And my heart goes out to you.</font>

141
00:15:27,361 --> 00:15:33,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know what it's like to stand helpless
while you loose the ones you love.</font>

142
00:15:35,365 --> 00:15:38,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">But killing Jeanine will not gonna bring your mother back.</font>

143
00:15:39,302 --> 00:15:43,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you're angry, but you're letting it consume you.</font>

144
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:47,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?</font>

145
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:08,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay here and keep quite.</font>

146
00:16:28,803 --> 00:16:32,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gentlemen, Amity welcomes you.</font>

147
00:16:33,036 --> 00:16:36,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">- To what do we owe the pleasure.
- This isn't really a social call Johanna.</font>

148
00:16:36,352 --> 00:16:39,678
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We're looking for divergents.
- I see.</font>

149
00:16:39,678 --> 00:16:44,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well of course, anything we can do to help.
- We need you to volunteer your faction to be tested.</font>

150
00:16:45,655 --> 00:16:48,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is screening technology from Erudite.</font>

151
00:16:48,263 --> 00:16:49,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">Amity.</font>

152
00:16:49,572 --> 00:16:52,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not that Jeanine is heading up yo the council
the whole improval processing got a little easier.</font>

153
00:16:52,466 --> 00:16:55,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're exceeding your jurisdiction.
- Now, Johanna.</font>

154
00:16:56,018 --> 00:16:58,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened to that Amity politeness.</font>

155
00:16:58,897 --> 00:17:04,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">The easy way, or the hard way?
It's up to you.</font>

156
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:12,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alright, but under protest.</font>

157
00:17:14,103 --> 00:17:16,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay we're good to go!
Move it out!</font>

158
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:23,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">All Amity report to the dome all come to
the dome for new mandatory testing.</font>

159
00:17:30,695 --> 00:17:33,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ok, lets go, get inside!</font>

160
00:17:47,461 --> 00:17:49,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know something lady?</font>

161
00:17:50,713 --> 00:17:53,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">You seem awfully stuck in that doorway.</font>

162
00:18:05,548 --> 00:18:08,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eric is here. We need to move now, come on.</font>

163
00:18:17,121 --> 00:18:20,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's up there?
- Just my office.</font>

164
00:18:43,429 --> 00:18:44,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's two guards with guns.</font>

165
00:18:46,339 --> 00:18:48,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're going out the window?</font>

166
00:18:49,288 --> 00:18:50,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to split up.</font>

167
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:55,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okey, yeah.</font>

168
00:18:55,804 --> 00:18:57,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every man for hmself.</font>

169
00:18:57,796 --> 00:18:59,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good.</font>

170
00:19:00,692 --> 00:19:02,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, they're up here!</font>

171
00:19:04,192 --> 00:19:06,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, they're up here! Come qon they're getting away!</font>

172
00:19:08,779 --> 00:19:10,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're ready?</font>

173
00:19:23,439 --> 00:19:24,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where?
- Out the window!</font>

174
00:19:27,567 --> 00:19:29,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got three on foot heading towards the dome!</font>

175
00:19:30,476 --> 00:19:34,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Get them low!
- Repeat, three on foot toward the dome.</font>

176
00:19:34,315 --> 00:19:35,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">Over there!</font>

177
00:19:35,787 --> 00:19:38,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I demand amnisty!
- Sit down! Sit down!</font>

178
00:19:38,009 --> 00:19:40,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe in Abignation, it's my right!</font>

179
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:51,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Detain him!
- Let's go!</font>

180
00:19:59,623 --> 00:20:01,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, keep moving!</font>

181
00:20:12,469 --> 00:20:13,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">Run!</font>

182
00:20:14,244 --> 00:20:15,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">Run!</font>

183
00:20:23,354 --> 00:20:25,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on!</font>

184
00:20:59,746 --> 00:21:01,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Listen!
- What?</font>

185
00:21:01,923 --> 00:21:03,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">A train!</font>

186
00:21:05,269 --> 00:21:06,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go, go, go!</font>

187
00:21:12,029 --> 00:21:13,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">Caleb!</font>

188
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:15,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep moving.</font>

189
00:21:24,471 --> 00:21:25,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ammo!</font>

190
00:21:40,369 --> 00:21:41,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, go.</font>

191
00:22:02,124 --> 00:22:03,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Go, go!
- Caleb!</font>

192
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">Move!</font>

193
00:22:42,221 --> 00:22:44,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">You sure know how to make an entrance!</font>

194
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:52,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Factionless.
- Amity.</font>

195
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:55,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you stare like dogs.</font>

196
00:22:57,045 --> 00:22:58,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have no idea what this one is.</font>

197
00:22:58,888 --> 00:23:03,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Look, we just need to get to the city, thats all.
- Well to bad, the train is taken.</font>

198
00:23:03,431 --> 00:23:06,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you damaged our cargo.</font>

199
00:23:09,336 --> 00:23:13,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">These are Abnegation and you are factionless right?</font>

200
00:23:13,905 --> 00:23:15,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Caleb!
- I used to be Abnegation.</font>

201
00:23:15,366 --> 00:23:18,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">We used the same bolts to make cloth for you.</font>

202
00:23:20,507 --> 00:23:22,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you saying that we steal from you?</font>

203
00:23:23,118 --> 00:23:25,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">No no, I'm no longer Abnegation,
so technically you're not stealing from me.</font>

204
00:23:25,943 --> 00:23:28,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you're not stealing at all.</font>

205
00:23:29,169 --> 00:23:34,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a questions of semantics I suppose
wether it's stealing or sharing.</font>

206
00:23:34,052 --> 00:23:36,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But it's all really the same.
- That's enough!</font>

207
00:23:36,013 --> 00:23:38,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody relax alright. You've made your point.</font>

208
00:23:38,482 --> 00:23:42,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We'll get off your train alright.
- Guy, would everybody just relax?</font>

209
00:23:42,251 --> 00:23:43,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't we take a seat?</font>

210
00:23:47,362 --> 00:23:49,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I was just trying to help!
- Don't.</font>

211
00:23:49,509 --> 00:23:51,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, this is going to be fun.</font>

212
00:23:51,042 --> 00:23:53,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody calm down alright?</font>

213
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Caleb.</font>

214
00:25:21,454 --> 00:25:23,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get off! Get off!</font>

215
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:52,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You alright?
- Yup.</font>

216
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you okay?</font>

217
00:26:05,017 --> 00:26:07,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Tobias Eaton.
- Say it again.</font>

218
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tobias Eaton.</font>

219
00:26:12,673 --> 00:26:14,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">What you know him?</font>

220
00:26:15,176 --> 00:26:16,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am him.</font>

221
00:26:23,163 --> 00:26:25,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have been looking for you.</font>

222
00:26:26,873 --> 00:26:28,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you talking about?</font>

223
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:47,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">Follow me.</font>

224
00:26:53,265 --> 00:26:56,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tris! I'm sorry, I wanted to help.</font>

225
00:27:06,846 --> 00:27:10,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">Four! Why are they looking for you?</font>

226
00:27:11,669 --> 00:27:13,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do they know your your name?</font>

227
00:27:26,105 --> 00:27:27,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is factionless.</font>

228
00:27:29,644 --> 00:27:31,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is insane.</font>

229
00:28:08,105 --> 00:28:09,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tobias!</font>

230
00:28:13,201 --> 00:28:14,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mother.</font>

231
00:28:21,785 --> 00:28:23,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought she was dead.</font>

232
00:28:26,778 --> 00:28:27,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me too.</font>

233
00:28:44,594 --> 00:28:46,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somebody please tell me what's going on here.</font>

234
00:28:51,349 --> 00:28:53,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tobias's father was very abusive.</font>

235
00:28:55,346 --> 00:28:59,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew the only way I could ever truly escape him was...</font>

236
00:28:59,061 --> 00:29:00,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">to disappear completely.</font>

237
00:29:03,391 --> 00:29:06,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abnegation helped me fake my death.</font>

238
00:29:06,354 --> 00:29:08,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anything to protect Marcus image.</font>

239
00:29:08,907 --> 00:29:11,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you just left him there alone with Marcus.</font>

240
00:29:12,748 --> 00:29:14,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was very young.</font>

241
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:18,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">I reached out to him about a year ago.</font>

242
00:29:18,761 --> 00:29:21,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">I felt it was finally time to reconnect.</font>

243
00:29:23,086 --> 00:29:26,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm still your mother.
- No, my mother is dead.</font>

244
00:29:28,044 --> 00:29:30,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">I went to her funeral when I was six.</font>

245
00:29:31,896 --> 00:29:34,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">And she wasn't trying to reconnect with me.</font>

246
00:29:34,736 --> 00:29:37,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was trying to use me.
Like you are now.</font>

247
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:38,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

248
00:29:39,876 --> 00:29:41,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">She wants an army.</font>

249
00:29:41,896 --> 00:29:43,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">- An army?
- I want an alliance.</font>

250
00:29:43,811 --> 00:29:46,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, what you want is revenge!
- This isn't about me.</font>

251
00:29:46,901 --> 00:29:51,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's about putting an end to a system
that says one group is more deserving than another.</font>

252
00:29:51,392 --> 00:29:55,848
<font color="#FFFFFF">This city may be surrounded by a wall
but it doesn't have to be a prison.</font>

253
00:29:56,519 --> 00:29:58,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think that's a bit extreme.</font>

254
00:29:58,582 --> 00:30:01,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, the factions isn't meant to be perfect
but it's hardly a prison.</font>

255
00:30:01,604 --> 00:30:04,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me guess, you're Erudite?</font>

256
00:30:07,061 --> 00:30:08,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was Erudite.</font>

257
00:30:13,291 --> 00:30:16,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are you willing to kill Jeanine?
- Absolutely.</font>

258
00:30:18,266 --> 00:30:20,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I was married to Marcus I knew her well.</font>

259
00:30:20,438 --> 00:30:22,964
<font color="#FFFFFF">And believe me, there's nothing she isn't capable of.</font>

260
00:30:22,964 --> 00:30:28,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But I think you alreay know that.
- Tris, we can't trust her.</font>

261
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:32,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Maybe she knows...
- We're on the same side, Tris.</font>

262
00:30:33,232 --> 00:30:36,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm factionless because I don't fit in any one faction.</font>

263
00:30:36,336 --> 00:30:39,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you're Divergent because you belong to too many..</font>

264
00:30:39,642 --> 00:30:42,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we are both a threat to Jeanine.</font>

265
00:30:43,314 --> 00:30:46,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">My people are ready for war if that's what it takes.</font>

266
00:30:46,148 --> 00:30:47,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then what?</font>

267
00:30:48,807 --> 00:30:51,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We depose those in power.
- And once you've done that?</font>

268
00:30:53,302 --> 00:30:56,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once you killed Jeanine, who's in power then?</font>

269
00:30:57,635 --> 00:31:02,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see, that's the part she always conveniently leaves out.</font>

270
00:31:04,182 --> 00:31:07,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't tell me this isn't about you, this is only about you.</font>

271
00:31:10,386 --> 00:31:13,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know where the remaining Dauntless are hiding.</font>

272
00:31:13,321 --> 00:31:16,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where?
- They took shelter in Candor.</font>

273
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">As far as I know they're still there.</font>

274
00:31:19,663 --> 00:31:22,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Think about it. If we were to combine forces,</font>

275
00:31:22,038 --> 00:31:26,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dauntless and Factionless, we'd be unstoppable.</font>

276
00:31:26,376 --> 00:31:27,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not gonna happen.</font>

277
00:31:27,781 --> 00:31:32,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you for your hospitality,
but we will be leaving in the morning.</font>

278
00:31:32,593 --> 00:31:34,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Four, maybe this is...</font>

279
00:31:34,048 --> 00:31:36,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tobias, please reconsider.</font>

280
00:31:36,882 --> 00:31:38,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you call me that.</font>

281
00:31:41,095 --> 00:31:42,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">My name is Four.</font>

282
00:31:51,835 --> 00:31:54,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to talk him in, or should I?</font>

283
00:32:17,265 --> 00:32:18,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">The food looks lovely.</font>

284
00:32:21,395 --> 00:32:22,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

285
00:32:36,182 --> 00:32:37,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

286
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:46,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should've told you about her.</font>

287
00:32:57,572 --> 00:32:59,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">No more secrets.</font>

288
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay?</font>

289
00:33:12,851 --> 00:33:15,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.</font>

290
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:22,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">I always loved to watch him sleep.</font>

291
00:33:26,826 --> 00:33:29,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">I take it you're setting out to Candor in the morning?</font>

292
00:33:29,536 --> 00:33:30,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

293
00:33:36,061 --> 00:33:39,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, I only want what's best for him.</font>

294
00:33:41,834 --> 00:33:43,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">You hardly even know him.</font>

295
00:33:45,805 --> 00:33:51,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'd like to think that wouldn't you?
But deep inside I think you're scared I know him all to well.</font>

296
00:33:54,326 --> 00:33:56,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Im not scared.
- Of course you are.</font>

297
00:33:56,615 --> 00:34:00,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're scared that he'll finally
see you for what you really are.</font>

298
00:34:03,298 --> 00:34:05,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">Deadly.</font>

299
00:34:08,077 --> 00:34:09,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't believe me?</font>

300
00:34:13,681 --> 00:34:15,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ask him.</font>

301
00:34:22,003 --> 00:34:23,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you okey?</font>

302
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:24,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

303
00:34:27,146 --> 00:34:29,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sure?
- Yeah.</font>

304
00:35:19,396 --> 00:35:22,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Im not going with you guys.
- What?</font>

305
00:35:24,431 --> 00:35:27,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">To Candor. I'm not going with you guys.</font>

306
00:35:31,394 --> 00:35:33,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What are you talking about?
- What's your plan?</font>

307
00:35:35,625 --> 00:35:37,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys are gonna find the rest of the Dauntless
and then what?</font>

308
00:35:38,032 --> 00:35:39,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">You attack Erudite?</font>

309
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:42,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">Assasinate Jeanine and start a civil war?</font>

310
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:45,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">Im sorry, I'm just not cut out for that.</font>

311
00:35:47,652 --> 00:35:49,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not like you guys.</font>

312
00:35:53,349 --> 00:35:58,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to get back to Abnegation maybe...
. Maybe I can be usefull there.</font>

313
00:35:58,936 --> 00:36:01,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">Caleb, there's nothing left in Abnegation.</font>

314
00:36:04,123 --> 00:36:05,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

315
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:41,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You okey?
- We just need to get to Candor.</font>

316
00:36:45,016 --> 00:36:46,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Triss!</font>

317
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:54,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you think Caleb is your responsibility
but he made his own choice.</font>

318
00:36:55,483 --> 00:36:57,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't protect everyone.</font>

319
00:36:59,032 --> 00:37:02,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I can't protect anyone.
- Nobody can.</font>

320
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:07,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">Him leaving isn't your fault. None of this is your fault.</font>

321
00:37:10,047 --> 00:37:13,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">Johanna was right. You have to forgive yourself.</font>

322
00:37:20,978 --> 00:37:22,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

323
00:37:23,268 --> 00:37:25,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">We gotta move.</font>

324
00:37:52,255 --> 00:37:54,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We found them!
- Yeah.</font>

325
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Damn it's good to see you guys.
- How are you?</font>

326
00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:03,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm better now. I'm not exactly good for layong low.</font>

327
00:38:03,612 --> 00:38:05,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Triss!
- Christina!</font>

328
00:38:08,469 --> 00:38:10,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's so good to see you.
- You too.</font>

329
00:38:10,695 --> 00:38:12,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you heard about Will?</font>

330
00:38:16,204 --> 00:38:18,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- Nothing?</font>

331
00:38:18,282 --> 00:38:19,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

332
00:38:20,675 --> 00:38:22,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something must have happened to him.</font>

333
00:38:23,255 --> 00:38:25,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">He would've found me by now you know.</font>

334
00:38:26,856 --> 00:38:29,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey.
- Hey.</font>

335
00:38:29,925 --> 00:38:31,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">How are you holding up?</font>

336
00:38:32,626 --> 00:38:34,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How many Dauntless do we have?
- 175 total.</font>

337
00:38:34,929 --> 00:38:37,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">- 175? That's it?
- The rest followed Max.</font>

338
00:38:37,833 --> 00:38:40,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Not nearly the number we need.</font>

339
00:38:40,336 --> 00:38:43,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold it! Grab the guns!</font>

340
00:38:45,501 --> 00:38:48,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey, they're with us.
- We know who you are.</font>

341
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:51,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Last warning. Drop your guns.</font>

342
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:55,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alright.</font>

343
00:39:06,603 --> 00:39:08,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">Easy.</font>

344
00:39:20,255 --> 00:39:23,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm Jack Kang, I'm leadership here.
- We know who you are.</font>

345
00:39:23,797 --> 00:39:25,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are not a threat to Candor.</font>

346
00:39:25,682 --> 00:39:28,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">That might be your truth, it's not neccesarily mine.</font>

347
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:33,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">All I know for certain is you are both wanted for
criminal insurgency and conspiring</font>

348
00:39:33,565 --> 00:39:35,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the attack on Abnegation.</font>

349
00:39:39,052 --> 00:39:40,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those are lies.</font>

350
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:43,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you were Candor I would take you at your word.</font>

351
00:39:44,918 --> 00:39:48,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unfortunately given the circumstances
I'm obliged to hand you over to the council.</font>

352
00:39:48,106 --> 00:39:51,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You can make your case there.
- You might as well kill us now.</font>

353
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:54,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">If Jeanine finds us, we're not gonna live to stand trial.</font>

354
00:39:54,764 --> 00:39:58,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">I doubt that very much.
She would never supersede the council.</font>

355
00:39:58,139 --> 00:40:02,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you sure about that?
Who's gonna stop her? You?</font>

356
00:40:03,286 --> 00:40:05,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">Factional law must be upheld.</font>

357
00:40:05,518 --> 00:40:07,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, wait wait wait.</font>

358
00:40:08,099 --> 00:40:09,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I ask you one question?</font>

359
00:40:11,318 --> 00:40:12,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I ask you one question?</font>

360
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:17,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeanine believes that Erudite are the most fit
to govern because they are the smartest.</font>

361
00:40:17,539 --> 00:40:21,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">You believe Candor is the most fittest
to judge because you are so honest?</font>

362
00:40:21,045 --> 00:40:23,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">I admit, I hold that belief.</font>

363
00:40:23,672 --> 00:40:26,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then, would you say I trial held here at Candor</font>

364
00:40:26,447 --> 00:40:29,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">would be inherently more fair than a trial held by Erudite?</font>

365
00:40:33,563 --> 00:40:35,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">The answer is yes.</font>

366
00:40:35,206 --> 00:40:39,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">In my opinion a Candor trial would have
the greatest chance of achieving true justice.</font>

367
00:40:40,469 --> 00:40:44,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you are asking me to petition a
council at the great Candor...?</font>

368
00:40:44,117 --> 00:40:47,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. As part of Candors initation
you administrate a truth serum.</font>

369
00:40:47,967 --> 00:40:49,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">Correctly.</font>

370
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:53,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't technically discuss that with other factions.</font>

371
00:40:53,893 --> 00:40:56,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's a pretty evasice answer.
- Evasion is not dishonest.</font>

372
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it's not exactly honest either.</font>

373
00:40:59,898 --> 00:41:03,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes, we possess such a serum.
- Then use it on us.</font>

374
00:41:03,782 --> 00:41:05,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">Four!</font>

375
00:41:05,083 --> 00:41:07,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we are guilty, we..? under the council.</font>

376
00:41:07,786 --> 00:41:10,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">If not, you just saved two lives.</font>

377
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:14,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And gain some loyal allies.
- Alright.</font>

378
00:41:14,282 --> 00:41:16,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you should know the serum can be quite brutal.</font>

379
00:41:16,813 --> 00:41:21,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was designed for tender applicants who
are already predisposed to honesty.</font>

380
00:41:21,619 --> 00:41:24,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not everyone find it so easy to share their secrets.</font>

381
00:41:26,277 --> 00:41:28,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I do not want to do it.
- We have to.</font>

382
00:41:29,244 --> 00:41:31,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">Neither of us have secrets worth dying for.</font>

383
00:41:41,735 --> 00:41:43,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let the truth set you free.</font>

384
00:42:01,344 --> 00:42:02,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tobias Eaton.</font>

385
00:42:06,418 --> 00:42:10,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are accused of conspiring with your fellow
Dauntless in the attack on Abnigation.</font>

386
00:42:10,932 --> 00:42:12,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this true?</font>

387
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:16,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">Conspiring no.</font>

388
00:42:16,583 --> 00:42:18,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I did attack.</font>

389
00:42:18,601 --> 00:42:23,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was in simulation controlled by Jeanine and
the rest of the Dauntless she had recruited.</font>

390
00:42:24,889 --> 00:42:26,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tris found me.</font>

391
00:42:27,668 --> 00:42:33,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">She managed to break me free from the simulation
and together we fought are way out.</font>

392
00:42:38,204 --> 00:42:41,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you are saying that Jeanine orchestrated this attack?</font>

393
00:42:42,797 --> 00:42:44,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

394
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:50,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">One last thing.</font>

395
00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:56,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you suspected that Jeanine had corrupted Dauntless,
why didn't you just leave?</font>

396
00:42:58,001 --> 00:43:00,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why did you stay?</font>

397
00:43:00,557 --> 00:43:02,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanted to leave.</font>

398
00:43:03,641 --> 00:43:05,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I fell in love with Tris Prior.</font>

399
00:43:09,396 --> 00:43:11,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I could not leave her.</font>

400
00:43:19,695 --> 00:43:21,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you for your Candor.</font>

401
00:43:21,855 --> 00:43:24,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you for your Candor.</font>

402
00:43:24,014 --> 00:43:29,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tobias Eaton, this trial has concluded conluded
and you are resolved of the guilt on the attack on Abnegation.</font>

403
00:43:32,077 --> 00:43:33,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">Miss Prior if you would.</font>

404
00:43:44,969 --> 00:43:46,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let the truth set you free.</font>

405
00:44:01,708 --> 00:44:02,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tris Prior</font>

406
00:44:05,197 --> 00:44:07,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr Eaton said you managed to free him from the sim.</font>

407
00:44:10,282 --> 00:44:11,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

408
00:44:12,043 --> 00:44:14,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you were never under the simulation yourself.</font>

409
00:44:15,697 --> 00:44:16,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

410
00:44:17,858 --> 00:44:19,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">How is that possible?</font>

411
00:44:20,807 --> 00:44:22,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because im Divergent.</font>

412
00:44:29,452 --> 00:44:31,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see.</font>

413
00:44:33,864 --> 00:44:38,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you never harmed any of your fellow
Dauntless or the Abnigation?</font>

414
00:44:38,297 --> 00:44:39,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did.</font>

415
00:44:49,976 --> 00:44:51,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who?</font>

416
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:55,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">My mom.</font>

417
00:44:58,115 --> 00:45:03,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">I watched her die first and then my dad.</font>

418
00:45:03,653 --> 00:45:06,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">They were killed when they tried to save me.</font>

419
00:45:14,291 --> 00:45:18,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">Miss Prior, the more you resist,
the more painfull the serum will be.</font>

420
00:45:26,047 --> 00:45:30,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">My friend ... I killed my friend.</font>

421
00:45:31,396 --> 00:45:33,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was trying to shoot me.</font>

422
00:45:40,655 --> 00:45:42,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">And ... I shot first.</font>

423
00:45:46,519 --> 00:45:48,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">What was his name?</font>

424
00:45:54,811 --> 00:45:56,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">What was his name?</font>

425
00:46:00,398 --> 00:46:04,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will. I killed Will.</font>

426
00:46:09,572 --> 00:46:17,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is what happens to
people that get close to me.</font>

427
00:46:26,126 --> 00:46:27,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">They get hurt or they die.</font>

428
00:46:30,369 --> 00:46:32,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't forgive myself.</font>

429
00:46:35,809 --> 00:46:37,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you for your Candor.</font>

430
00:46:37,885 --> 00:46:40,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you for your Candor.</font>

431
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:56,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Triss!</font>

432
00:47:01,804 --> 00:47:03,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">Im sorry.</font>

433
00:47:05,092 --> 00:47:07,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you I didn't want to do that.</font>

434
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:21,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Christina.
- Go.</font>

435
00:47:24,411 --> 00:47:25,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go.</font>

436
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:37,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abignation sim complete.</font>

437
00:47:39,023 --> 00:47:40,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dauntless sim initiated.</font>

438
00:47:43,967 --> 00:47:46,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mam, the Divergents vitals is dropping.</font>

439
00:47:46,195 --> 00:47:50,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">- If we don't pull her out of the sim soon we'll loose her.
- You stop when I say so.</font>

440
00:47:56,913 --> 00:47:58,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's gonna do it.</font>

441
00:48:02,809 --> 00:48:04,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's gonna pas the sim.</font>

442
00:48:07,882 --> 00:48:10,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dauntless sim failed.</font>

443
00:48:11,934 --> 00:48:14,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">Divergent test subject six is no longer vital.</font>

444
00:48:17,518 --> 00:48:19,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alright shut it down.</font>

445
00:48:21,833 --> 00:48:23,300

495
00:54:55,929 --> 00:54:58,717

of ssomething like this.</font>

524
00:58:38,318 --> 00:58:40,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's time we fight back.</font>

- It's simple.</font>

552
01:00:34,083 --> 01:00:36,920

She was borne out of Abegnation.</font>

553
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:39,579

<font color="#FFFFFF">Kill the host?</font>

578
01:02:58,907 --> 01:03:00,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what do we do?</font>

579
01:03:00,215 --> 01:03:03,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tori must neutralize the disk before we do anything else.</font>

580
01:03:03,409 --> 01:03:05,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or we can do the logical thing.</font>

581

<font color="#FFFFFF">We hand her over.</font>

582

<font color="#FFFFFF">it might buy some time.</font>

585
01:03:25,492 --> 01:03:26,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think it's a good idea.</font>

586
01:03:27,393 --> 01:03:30,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you have to go through me first.</font>

587

<font color="#FFFFFF">- Me too.
- And us.</font>

590
01:04:23,565 --> 01:04:25,331

01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:51,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">Together.</font>

597
01:04:53,003 --> 01:04:54,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I'm just one person.</font>

598
01:04:57,900 --> 01:05:00,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm not worth it.
- You are worth it.</font>

599
01:05:00,518 --> 01:05:02,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are more than worth it to me.</font>

600
01:05:04,427 --> 01:05:06,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love you.</font>

601
01:07:16,454 --> 01:07:19,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">This city may be safe behind a closed wall,</font>

602
01:07:20,443 --> 01:07:25,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">but make no mistake, that wall alone
doesn't ensure our security.</font>

603
01:07:27,137 --> 01:07:34,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's up to us, everyone of us, to remain
vigilant and isolate any threat against us.</font>

604
01:07:35,273 --> 01:07:39,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are individuals hiding among
us who must be contained.</font>

605
01:07:40,195 --> 01:07:44,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Permitt me to adress the objections from
my fellow faction leaders.</font>

606
01:07:45,132 --> 01:07:48,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm aware that there has been some concerns
about the unavoidable raid on Candor</font>

607
01:07:48,759 --> 01:07:52,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">so let me be clear.</font>

608
01:07:53,865 --> 01:07:57,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">The harbouring of Divergents from any faction</font>

609
01:07:57,297 --> 01:07:59,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">can not be tolerated.</font>

610
01:08:00,998 --> 01:08:06,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very soon I will present what I believe to be no less
than a mandates from the founders themselves.</font>

611
01:08:07,655 --> 01:08:12,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">On this I have no doubt on the measure I have taken to keep the peace.</font>

612
01:08:13,643 --> 01:08:18,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have provided instructions that will allow
us to eradicate the Divergence crisis</font>

613
01:08:18,106 --> 01:08:19,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once and for all.</font>

614
01:08:35,097 --> 01:08:36,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are you going?</font>

615
01:08:37,496 --> 01:08:39,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">She has left. She's gone.</font>

616
01:08:40,641 --> 01:08:42,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? When?</font>

617
01:08:43,563 --> 01:08:45,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Last night.
- Wait.</font>

618
01:08:49,307 --> 01:08:52,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tobias! People look to you for leadership.</font>

619
01:08:52,630 --> 01:08:54,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't just abandon them</font>

620
01:08:59,904 --> 01:09:01,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tobias!</font>

621
01:09:10,787 --> 01:09:11,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow!</font>

622
01:09:13,890 --> 01:09:15,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to admit that I'm surprised.</font>

623
01:09:17,278 --> 01:09:19,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I know that you are dumb but..</font>

624
01:09:19,576 --> 01:09:22,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't think you were dumb enough
to actually come down here.</font>

625
01:09:23,128 --> 01:09:24,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">And turn yourself in.</font>

626
01:09:30,463 --> 01:09:31,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">The killings had to stop.</font>

627
01:09:33,019 --> 01:09:36,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">That just shows that you can take the girl from Abnigation</font>

628
01:09:36,591 --> 01:09:38,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you cant take Abnigation out of her.</font>

629
01:09:39,264 --> 01:09:41,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go.</font>

630
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:44,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once a stiff, always a stiff. Right?</font>

631
01:09:55,127 --> 01:09:58,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What is this?
- What is this? This is the whole reason you are locked Tris.</font>

632
01:09:59,693 --> 01:10:02,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">Man I love knowing stuff you don't.</font>

633
01:10:03,536 --> 01:10:05,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need you to open that box Tris.</font>

634
01:10:11,592 --> 01:10:14,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">The only way to open that box is to
pass the sims of all five factions.</font>

635
01:10:16,917 --> 01:10:20,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">But te only people who have
tried to it so far have died.</font>

636
01:10:23,899 --> 01:10:25,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think I was supposed to tell you that.</font>

637
01:10:26,163 --> 01:10:27,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well...</font>

638
01:10:28,298 --> 01:10:29,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">No pressure.</font>

639
01:10:30,779 --> 01:10:32,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remarkable!</font>

640
01:10:33,287 --> 01:10:37,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">The chances of it being you of all people.</font>

641
01:10:38,497 --> 01:10:40,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nearly defies the laws of probability.</font>

642
01:10:44,546 --> 01:10:46,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">As remarkable as many people you managed to murder?</font>

643
01:10:49,618 --> 01:10:52,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dark times call for extrme measures.</font>

644
01:10:54,243 --> 01:10:57,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">You may find it hard to believe.</font>

645
01:10:57,032 --> 01:10:59,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I'm serving the greater good.</font>

646
01:11:02,140 --> 01:11:03,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">Step up on the disc please.</font>

647
01:11:25,341 --> 01:11:27,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">Step up on the disc please.</font>

648
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:36,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mam?</font>

649
01:11:45,779 --> 01:11:48,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop the suicides or I swear I will shoot him.</font>

650
01:11:49,073 --> 01:11:53,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's okey. You can kill him if you want,
we have plenty of guards.</font>

651
01:11:55,114 --> 01:11:56,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

652
01:12:34,502 --> 01:12:39,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm guesing you need me alive
for this to work. Right?</font>

653
01:12:42,271 --> 01:12:43,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right?</font>

654
01:12:56,579 --> 01:12:58,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tris.</font>

655
01:13:01,798 --> 01:13:03,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">Caleb.</font>

656
01:13:04,988 --> 01:13:06,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Caleb.</font>

657
01:13:06,684 --> 01:13:10,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't engage to subject.</font>

658
01:13:11,868 --> 01:13:13,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Conditions are already less then optimal.</font>

659
01:13:22,929 --> 01:13:24,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">My God.</font>

660
01:13:34,859 --> 01:13:37,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I do this the suicides stop?</font>

661
01:13:40,175 --> 01:13:43,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. The suicides will continue.</font>

662
01:13:44,378 --> 01:13:47,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Until you suced and pass all five sims.</font>

663
01:13:49,182 --> 01:13:51,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">That should be suffiecent enough.</font>

664
01:13:54,618 --> 01:13:55,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good luck.</font>

665
01:15:07,859 --> 01:15:08,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's begin.</font>

666
01:15:11,262 --> 01:15:13,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">Initialize the Dauntless sim.</font>

667
01:15:33,034 --> 01:15:34,034

<font color="#FFFFFF">Tris, help me!</font>

669
01:16:10,914 --> 01:16:12,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heart rate is rising.</font>

670
01:16:14,257 --> 01:16:15,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep her in play.</font>

671
01:16:35,125 --> 01:16:36,315

680
01:18:56,405 --> 01:18:58,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I'm still with you..</font>

681
01:19:09,493 --> 01:19:11,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need to be strong now.</font>

682
01:19:12,743 --> 01:19:14,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me you're gonna be strong.</font>

683
01:19:15,050 --> 01:19:17,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm trying.
- You can do this.</font>

684
01:19:17,409 --> 01:19:19,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you can.</font>

685
01:19:19,863 --> 01:19:24,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're brave. Braver than anyone.</font>

686
01:19:25,546 --> 01:19:27,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not brave mom.</font>

687
01:19:30,554 --> 01:19:32,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">I pretend that I am.</font>

688
01:19:33,838 --> 01:19:36,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want people to think that I am, but I'm not.</font>

689
01:19:40,738 --> 01:19:43,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm really really scared and...</font>

690
01:19:44,207 --> 01:19:47,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe we are actually what's wrong in this world.</font>

691
01:19:48,876 --> 01:19:50,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">Divergents.</font>

692
01:19:52,025 --> 01:19:54,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never wanted any of this.</font>

693
01:19:55,628 --> 01:19:59,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">You and dad and Caleb and Four.</font>

694
01:19:59,858 --> 01:20:06,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't help but think that if I was normal
we would all still be together.</font>

695
01:20:08,224 --> 01:20:11,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mom, I don't want to be Divergent anymore.</font>

696
01:20:11,168 --> 01:20:14,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just want to feel safe again.</font>

697
01:20:17,217 --> 01:20:19,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">Candor sim complete.</font>

698
01:20:39,478 --> 01:20:42,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">Four. You're here?</font>

699
01:20:42,251 --> 01:20:43,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I'm here.</font>

700
01:20:45,981 --> 01:20:47,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are you okay?
- Yeah.</font>

701
01:20:49,078 --> 01:20:50,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">Secure the hallway.</font>

702
01:20:54,472 --> 01:20:55,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's get you out of here.</font>

703
01:20:57,739 --> 01:20:58,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You good?
- Yeah.</font>

704
01:21:13,618 --> 01:21:15,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop. Let him go.</font>

705
01:21:16,270 --> 01:21:17,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, you're not gonna shoot me?</font>

706
01:21:18,795 --> 01:21:20,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once a stiff, always a stiff.</font>

707
01:21:33,372 --> 01:21:34,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go!</font>

708
01:21:41,275 --> 01:21:44,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">Four, how did you get passed security?</font>

709
01:21:44,507 --> 01:21:47,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know me, scary boyfriend skills.</font>

710
01:21:51,899 --> 01:21:53,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it?</font>

711
01:21:56,131 --> 01:21:59,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">You weren't there. You didn't even hear that.</font>

712
01:22:01,305 --> 01:22:02,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tris.</font>

713
01:22:03,055 --> 01:22:04,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to leave now. Alright?</font>

714
01:22:06,279 --> 01:22:07,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry Four.</font>

715
01:22:08,597 --> 01:22:11,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- I'm sorry I didn't tell you I was gonna go.</font>

716
01:22:12,835 --> 01:22:15,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanted to say goodbye, but I just didn't know how.</font>

717
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:18,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I didn't know how.
- What are you talking about?</font>

718
01:22:22,793 --> 01:22:29,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even though I didn't get to say it in real life,
at least I get to say it now.</font>

719
01:22:29,662 --> 01:22:33,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Even if it is just a sim.
- Tris, we're not in a sim.</font>

720
01:22:34,533 --> 01:22:40,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Don't you think I would know if I were in a sim?
- You're not in a sim.</font>

721
01:22:43,636 --> 01:22:47,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're the sim.
- Wait, wait.</font>

722
01:23:20,048 --> 01:23:21,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">Erudite sim complete.</font>

723
01:23:22,788 --> 01:23:26,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ther's only Amity now.
- She hasn't passed Abnigation yet.</font>

724
01:23:26,597 --> 01:23:29,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes she has. When she spared your life.</font>

725
01:23:31,820 --> 01:23:34,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">This girl is extraordinary.</font>

726
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:37,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">She tested positive for four factions in one day.</font>

727
01:23:40,162 --> 01:23:41,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one has gotten that far.</font>

728
01:23:43,518 --> 01:23:44,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got a problem.</font>

729
01:23:50,314 --> 01:23:52,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's crashing. We have to rest her.</font>

730
01:23:53,627 --> 01:23:56,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you sure you're not letting
familiar attachment cloud your judgement?</font>

731
01:23:56,729 --> 01:23:58,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">See for yourself.</font>

732
01:24:06,137 --> 01:24:07,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very well.</font>

733
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:11,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Detach the subject.</font>

734
01:24:22,342 --> 01:24:25,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good work, gentlemen. We will resume tomorrow.</font>

735
01:25:08,332 --> 01:25:11,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were never planing on going
back to Abnegation, were you?</font>

736
01:25:14,314 --> 01:25:16,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had to do what I though was right.</font>

737
01:25:17,246 --> 01:25:19,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">My parents would be ashamed of you.</font>

738
01:25:20,913 --> 01:25:26,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well maybe not. I mean I'm willing to sacrifice you.</font>

739
01:25:27,393 --> 01:25:28,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">The only family I have left.</font>

740
01:25:28,998 --> 01:25:32,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">The only person that I love.
In order to preserve what's best for everyone else.</font>

741
01:25:35,207 --> 01:25:36,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's more selfless than that?</font>

742
01:25:45,666 --> 01:25:48,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">What does Jeanine think is in that box Caleb?</font>

743
01:25:49,207 --> 01:25:50,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a message from the founders.</font>

744
01:25:51,287 --> 01:25:55,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the box was to be opened
only if the factions broke down.</font>

745
01:25:55,582 --> 01:25:57,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wich is why we require someone like you to open it.</font>

746
01:25:59,122 --> 01:26:03,109

748
01:26:07,269 --> 01:26:10,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one think it's your fault that you were born this way.</font>

749

<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeanine murdered an entire faction Caleb.</font>

750
01:26:12,632 --> 01:26:14,881

754
01:26:21,528 --> 01:26:23,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">The box, it was in their house.</font>

755
01:26:23,784 --> 01:26:25,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">They were the ones hiding it.</font>

756
01:26:25,689 --> 01:26:27,792

757

<font color="#FFFFFF">Please just let Four go.</font>

765
01:27:19,576 --> 01:27:24,484

should focus on the task at hand.</font>

Do you appreciate irony?</font>

767
01:27:30,746 --> 01:27:35,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">You tested positive for Erudite so
you must have the intellectual capacity.</font>

768
01:27:35,757 --> 01:27:36,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Irony.</font>

769
01:27:36,855 --> 01:27:41,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">For instance. Right now you are full of hate,
but you need to pass an Amity sim.</font>

770
01:27:46,234 --> 01:27:48,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then there are other ironies at work too.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the reason I'm in this mess.</font>

774
01:27:57,342 --> 01:28:00,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And then there the most pointed irony of all.
- Stop.</font>

775
01:28:00,384 --> 01:28:04,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">That Nathalie Prior not only died trying
to protect the data that I now have.</font>

776
01:28:04,988 --> 01:28:07,042

799
01:33:26,922 --> 01:33:28,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey Four, that's pretty good right?</font>

800
01:33:28,793 --> 01:33:33,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">First I stole paralytic. Then I shot her up

I guess they should've listened.</font>

Now is not the time for souvenirs.</font>

My mother would have destroyed it.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">No one sees it. Ever.</font>

895
01:43:43,850 --> 01:43:45,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kill them both.</font>

896
01:43:45,301 --> 01:43:46,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

897
01:43:53,667 --> 01:43:54,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't move.</font>

898
01:43:59,421 --> 01:44:01,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put your weapons down now!</font>

899
01:44:01,923 --> 01:44:06,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Stay!
- Do not move!</font>

900
01:44:10,215 --> 01:44:11,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Jeanine.</font>

901
01:44:13,283 --> 01:44:14,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">Evelyn.</font>

902
01:44:14,507 --> 01:44:16,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">Impressive.</font>

903
01:44:16,387 --> 01:44:18,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think we're gonna like it here.</font>

904
01:44:19,239 --> 01:44:22,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you honestly think the other
factions will stand for this?</font>

905
01:44:22,734 --> 01:44:24,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because you're so popular?</font>

906
01:44:27,188 --> 01:44:28,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get her out of here.</font>

907
01:44:29,529 --> 01:44:33,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">When that message gets out it will be the end.</font>

908
01:44:51,340 --> 01:44:53,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">What message?</font>

909
01:44:56,614 --> 01:45:01,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll see. I'm gonna put it on every monitor in the city.</font>

910
01:45:03,449 --> 01:45:06,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have seperated you from the rest of us.</font>

911
01:45:08,095 --> 01:45:11,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we created factions to ensure peace.</font>

912
01:45:13,244 --> 01:45:17,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">The time has come for you to emerge
from your isolation and rejoin us.</font>

913
01:45:19,190 --> 01:45:22,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have allowed you to believe that you're the last of us,</font>

914
01:45:22,750 --> 01:45:24,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you're not.</font>

915
01:45:24,753 --> 01:45:30,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you're watching this now than at least one of
you are proof that our experiment has succeded.</font>

916
01:45:33,868 --> 01:45:38,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mankind waits for you, with hope,</font>

917
01:45:38,837 --> 01:45:41,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">beyond the wall.</font>

918
01:46:18,082 --> 01:46:19,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">These will be the Divergent.</font>

919
01:46:19,716 --> 01:46:22,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">They are the true purpose of the experiment.</font>

920
01:46:22,359 --> 01:46:25,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">They are vital to humanitys survival.</font>

921
01:46:26,216 --> 01:46:27,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">You did it.</font>

922
01:46:36,095 --> 01:46:38,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone's staring at me.</font>

923
01:46:39,168 --> 01:46:40,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">You changed everything.</font>

924
01:46:43,136 --> 01:46:44,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">What now?</font>

925
01:46:45,667 --> 01:46:47,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only one way to find out.</font>

926
01:46:48,577 --> 01:46:49,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're ready?</font>

927
01:47:54,337 --> 01:47:56,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's been over 200 years.</font>

928
01:47:59,640 --> 01:48:01,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who knows what's out there?</font>

929
01:48:04,088 --> 01:48:05,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll never find out.</font>
