00:08:02,555 --> 00:08:04,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have a captain
with no combat experience.</font>

149
00:08:04,757 --> 00:08:06,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's never been to war.</font>

150
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:07,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's only led you in training.</font>

151
00:08:07,526 --> 00:08:09,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's already been
bumped up to staff.</font>

152
00:08:09,194 --> 00:08:10,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a career wrecker.</font>

153
00:08:10,596 --> 00:08:12,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">You understand that, right?</font>

154
00:08:12,064 --> 00:08:14,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, all due respect,
I've spent two years</font>

155
00:08:14,266 --> 00:08:16,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">with that fellow
leadin' our team.</font>

156
00:08:16,834 --> 00:08:19,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you think furthering
his career is why he joined,</font>

157
00:08:19,538 --> 00:08:22,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">you need to get to know
your captain, sir.</font>

158
00:08:27,646 --> 00:08:29,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">As you were.</font>

159
00:08:31,182 --> 00:08:35,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sorry about the desk.
- No, no. It's a good kill.</font>

160
00:08:35,354 --> 00:08:37,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Besides, you're not gonna
need it where you're going.</font>

161
00:08:52,538 --> 00:08:55,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">Special Forces
doesn't have thermals?</font>

162
00:08:56,475 --> 00:08:58,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">Army wasn't expecting this.</font>

163
00:08:58,442 --> 00:08:59,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

164
00:08:59,412 --> 00:09:01,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that makes two of us.</font>

165
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:10,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">You tell him. I'm not doing
your dirty work for you.</font>

166
00:09:11,057 --> 00:09:12,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">Marsha.</font>

167
00:09:15,293 --> 00:09:17,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll love you
when you get back.</font>

168
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, buddy.</font>

169
00:09:30,807 --> 00:09:32,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leaving?</font>

170
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I gotta go.</font>

171
00:09:35,346 --> 00:09:37,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long?</font>

172
00:09:38,484 --> 00:09:39,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't know.</font>

173
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

174
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:51,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know I love you, right?</font>

175
00:10:08,815 --> 00:10:10,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wow.</font>

176
00:10:10,249 --> 00:10:11,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">Made it all the way
to the oven, huh, babe?</font>

177
00:10:11,951 --> 00:10:14,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some wives cry, I clean.</font>

178
00:10:14,552 --> 00:10:17,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, uh,
I was thinking...</font>

179
00:10:17,623 --> 00:10:19,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're gonna have
all the time in the world</font>

180
00:10:19,725 --> 00:10:22,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">to clean that oven
once I'm gone.</font>

181
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:24,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'm kind of running
out of time. So...</font>

182
00:10:24,995 --> 00:10:28,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, and I bet I know
just how you wanna spend it.</font>

183
00:10:28,634 --> 00:10:31,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I have two hours.
I'll be really quick.</font>

184
00:10:31,336 --> 00:10:33,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Super quick.
- Uh-huh, yeah, not a chance.</font>

185
00:10:33,338 --> 00:10:34,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">Holding out is the only way</font>

186
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:36,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can guarantee
you come back to me.</font>

187
00:10:36,475 --> 00:10:38,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Please?
- Mmm-mmm.</font>

188
00:10:38,408 --> 00:10:40,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Just the tip.
- Mmm-mmm.</font>

189
00:10:41,514 --> 00:10:43,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay, you know what?
- Mmm-hmm.</font>

190
00:10:43,349 --> 00:10:44,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">War's gonna be over so quick.</font>

191
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's gonna be over
in like a week.</font>

192
00:10:46,418 --> 00:10:48,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">I promise.</font>

193
00:10:50,654 --> 00:10:52,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go wake up the kids.</font>

194
00:10:52,157 --> 00:10:54,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">Spend the time with them.</font>

195
00:10:54,426 --> 00:10:57,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know what I signed up for.
They don't.</font>

196
00:11:24,855 --> 00:11:28,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't wish for what
you don't want.</font>

197
00:11:31,028 --> 00:11:35,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were on a flight
to New York two months ago.</font>

198
00:11:35,701 --> 00:11:39,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have
to justify it to me.</font>

199
00:11:39,071 --> 00:11:41,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a soldier's wife.</font>

200
00:11:41,941 --> 00:11:44,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I've been lucky.</font>

201
00:11:44,475 --> 00:11:47,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">All I've had
to worry about so far</font>

202
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:50,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">is malaria
and chopper crashes.</font>

203
00:11:50,548 --> 00:11:53,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Most dangerous part's
the ride in and out.</font>

204
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not anymore.</font>

205
00:12:00,426 --> 00:12:04,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care
how long you're gone</font>

206
00:12:04,028 --> 00:12:06,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">as long as you come back.</font>

207
00:12:08,066 --> 00:12:09,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">You understand?</font>

208
00:12:09,969 --> 00:12:11,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I do.</font>

209
00:12:14,407 --> 00:12:18,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then say you're coming home.</font>

210
00:12:18,777 --> 00:12:21,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't, baby.
It's bad luck.</font>

211
00:12:26,951 --> 00:12:29,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to hear you say it.</font>

212
00:12:32,224 --> 00:12:34,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm comin' home.</font>

213
00:13:04,456 --> 00:13:07,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, ODA 595:
Where do we bunk?</font>

214
00:13:07,692 --> 00:13:09,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, you see
those Quonset huts?</font>

215
00:13:09,394 --> 00:13:10,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those are for the teams.</font>

216
00:13:10,662 --> 00:13:12,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">ODA numbers
are on the door, sir.</font>

217
00:13:13,865 --> 00:13:15,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't salute in country.</font>

218
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you trying to get
our captain killed, bro?</font>

219
00:13:17,369 --> 00:13:18,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">These are all friendlies.</font>

220
00:13:18,971 --> 00:13:20,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah?</font>

221
00:13:20,338 --> 00:13:22,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who, that guy?
That's not my friend.</font>

222
00:13:22,206 --> 00:13:24,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that guy's
definitely not my friend.</font>

223
00:13:24,143 --> 00:13:25,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fucking Diller, bro.</font>

224
00:13:25,576 --> 00:13:27,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could be their friend.
He looks nice.</font>

225
00:13:27,177 --> 00:13:28,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">That guy?</font>

226
00:13:28,312 --> 00:13:29,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

227
00:13:30,783 --> 00:13:32,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heads up. Heads up.</font>

228
00:13:34,086 --> 00:13:36,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's up, guys? Looks like
Christmas came early, huh?</font>

229
00:13:36,888 --> 00:13:39,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah. Ho, ho, ho.
Where have you guys been?</font>

230
00:13:39,524 --> 00:13:41,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, we went to
a fucking Nickelback concert.</font>

231
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">How was it?
Throw your panties on stage?</font>

232
00:13:43,195 --> 00:13:45,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nah, nah, nah, we got stuck
in a holding position</font>

233
00:13:45,397 --> 00:13:46,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">- till the weather broke.
- From what I hear,</font>

234
00:13:46,965 --> 00:13:48,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">the weather here
doesn't change until June.</font>

235
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">Snowed last night.
So get used to it.</font>

236
00:13:50,201 --> 00:13:51,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What? Really?
- Yeah.</font>

237
00:13:51,534 --> 00:13:53,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, what's all this?</font>

238
00:13:53,072 --> 00:13:55,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone gave the quartermaster
a Gold Card.</font>

239
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, the only unit</font>

240
00:13:57,642 --> 00:13:59,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">with any cold weather tac-gear is the
10th Mountain. They ain't sharing.</font>

241
00:13:59,812 --> 00:14:01,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make sure
everyone carries a GPS.</font>

242
00:14:01,514 --> 00:14:03,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">I couldn't find one topo map
of this place.</font>

243
00:14:03,514 --> 00:14:06,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Copy that, Captain.
- Hey, look what 515 left outside their tents.</font>

244
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">—Hey, guys, quiet down.
Oh, it's Britney Spears!</font>

245
00:14:09,388 --> 00:14:10,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">Five months in country,</font>

246
00:14:10,788 --> 00:14:12,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">this hair is what
you're getting, man.</font>

247
00:14:12,591 --> 00:14:13,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, man. Is that a wig?
Can I touch it? Just one time.</font>

248
00:14:13,993 --> 00:14:16,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ask Coffers' wife, man.
She loves it.</font>

249
00:14:16,695 --> 00:14:18,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

250
00:14:18,163 --> 00:14:20,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cap said grow it out, guys.
What happened? What happened?</font>

251
00:14:20,499 --> 00:14:23,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa! Whoa! Be careful!
Vern knows Krav Maga!</font>

252
00:14:24,701 --> 00:14:26,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't even think about...</font>

253
00:14:32,711 --> 00:14:35,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, pencils down.</font>

254
00:14:35,379 --> 00:14:37,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">The other five teams
have been interviewed.</font>

255
00:14:37,383 --> 00:14:41,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, Cap, we're all countin'
on you, so, you know,</font>

256
00:14:41,019 --> 00:14:43,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">- no pressure.
- Thanks, buddy.</font>

257
00:14:43,254 --> 00:14:44,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">See you soon, boys.</font>

258
00:14:44,556 --> 00:14:47,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yep. Give 'em hell, Cap.</font>

259
00:14:52,062 --> 00:14:54,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bin Laden has been financing
the Taliban and Al-Qaeda,</font>

260
00:14:54,966 --> 00:14:59,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">setting up terrorist training
camps all over Afghanistan.</font>

261
00:14:59,504 --> 00:15:01,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's had one big win
on U.S. soil.</font>

262
00:15:01,907 --> 00:15:03,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wants another.</font>

263
00:15:03,676 --> 00:15:06,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if we don't stop him,
there will be more.</font>

264
00:15:06,543 --> 00:15:09,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bin Laden might be the brains,
but make no mistake about it,</font>

265
00:15:09,749 --> 00:15:13,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">in Afghanistan,
the Taliban is the muscle.</font>

266
00:15:13,183 --> 00:15:15,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we remove them
from power,</font>

267
00:15:15,687 --> 00:15:17,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">he can't use them
to make his attacks.</font>

268
00:15:17,956 --> 00:15:19,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mazar-I-Sharif.</font>

269
00:15:19,825 --> 00:15:22,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoever controls that city,
controls Afghanistan.</font>

270
00:15:22,495 --> 00:15:24,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we take Mazar
from the Taliban,</font>

271
00:15:24,763 --> 00:15:27,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">then we cripple Bin Laden.</font>

272
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:29,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's half-right.</font>

273
00:15:29,701 --> 00:15:31,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you're gonna interrupt me,</font>

274
00:15:31,034 --> 00:15:33,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">you should probably
be entirely right.</font>

275
00:15:33,239 --> 00:15:35,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, we aren't taking anything.</font>

276
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:38,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">The man who's gonna take Mazar
is named General Dostum.</font>

277
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:40,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's an Afghan warlord
with the Northern Alliance.</font>

278
00:15:40,778 --> 00:15:43,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">He has the troops, he has the
intel, he knows the cliffs.</font>

279
00:15:43,514 --> 00:15:46,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">He knows every cave
and most importantly,</font>

280
00:15:46,585 --> 00:15:48,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">he does not care
for the Taliban.</font>

281
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:50,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">So this is about airstrikes?</font>

282
00:15:51,322 --> 00:15:53,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, sir.</font>

283
00:15:53,057 --> 00:15:54,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you nailed that one.</font>

284
00:15:54,557 --> 00:15:57,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dostum cannot take out
the Taliban by himself.</font>

285
00:15:57,129 --> 00:15:58,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's the plan.</font>

286
00:15:58,562 --> 00:16:00,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna drop you into
Northern Afghanistan.</font>

287
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:03,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">There, you will meet up
with a CIA operative</font>

288
00:16:03,302 --> 00:16:05,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">who will take you to Dostum.</font>

289
00:16:05,302 --> 00:16:07,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your mission,</font>

290
00:16:07,004 --> 00:16:09,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">earn Dostum's trust,</font>

291
00:16:09,072 --> 00:16:10,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">embed with his militia,</font>

292
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:13,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">you fight alongside him while he makes
his way to Taliban strongholds.</font>

293
00:16:13,913 --> 00:16:17,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">When you get there, you call in
for close air support strikes.</font>

294
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dostum will do the rest.</font>

295
00:16:18,716 --> 00:16:21,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">One by one,
stronghold by stronghold,</font>

296
00:16:21,186 --> 00:16:24,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">until he takes Mazar,
and the Taliban falls.</font>

297
00:16:24,221 --> 00:16:26,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got six weeks.</font>

298
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:28,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd say three weeks, sir.</font>

299
00:16:28,293 --> 00:16:30,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">- God damn it.
- No, no.</font>

300
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, I'll bite.</font>

301
00:16:33,062 --> 00:16:34,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why three?</font>

302
00:16:34,798 --> 00:16:37,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Russians have been here before, right?
They've done this.</font>

303
00:16:37,033 --> 00:16:38,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">And they wrote about it.</font>

304
00:16:38,403 --> 00:16:39,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">They said the snow
was shutting down</font>

305
00:16:39,971 --> 00:16:42,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">all the mountain passes
by mid-November.</font>

306
00:16:42,774 --> 00:16:44,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every year, without fail.</font>

307
00:16:44,743 --> 00:16:46,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, if the Russians are
talking about a bad winter,</font>

308
00:16:46,543 --> 00:16:48,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's usually worth
paying attention to, isn't it?</font>

309
00:16:48,678 --> 00:16:51,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">After three weeks,
we will not get into Mazar.</font>

310
00:16:51,216 --> 00:16:55,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">That snow will hit, the Taliban will
dig in, and my men won't come home.</font>

311
00:16:55,653 --> 00:16:58,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your air support comes
from B-52s at 35,000 feet.</font>

312
00:16:58,423 --> 00:17:00,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you think you're gonna
get close enough to be accurate</font>

313
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:02,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">without parking a bomb
in your lap?</font>

314
00:17:02,192 --> 00:17:03,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll have to get
out of the way, sir.</font>

315
00:17:05,262 --> 00:17:07,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">The extra three weeks
is cushion for your fuck-ups.</font>

316
00:17:07,464 --> 00:17:09,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">There won't be any fuck-ups.
Three weeks is all we need.</font>

317
00:17:09,366 --> 00:17:12,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pretty confident for a guy
who's never done this before.</font>

318
00:17:12,538 --> 00:17:13,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never been to war.</font>

319
00:17:13,971 --> 00:17:16,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't see that
as a disadvantage, sir.</font>

320
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, maybe you should
explain that.</font>

321
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:21,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're teaming up with a warlord
that we know nothing about.</font>

322
00:17:21,814 --> 00:17:24,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not gonna be able to tell
our enemies from our allies.</font>

323
00:17:24,214 --> 00:17:28,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every step we take is gonna be on a
minefield from a hundred different wars.</font>

324
00:17:28,317 --> 00:17:31,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">And no one's ever called in a
smart bomb air strike from a B-52.</font>

325
00:17:31,355 --> 00:17:33,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">So anyone who tells you
they've done this before</font>

326
00:17:33,726 --> 00:17:35,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">or has experience in this
is lying, sir.</font>

327
00:17:35,794 --> 00:17:39,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no playbook here. We're
gonna have to write it ourselves.</font>

328
00:17:39,298 --> 00:17:43,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">I briefed five potential
captains for this mission.</font>

329
00:17:43,567 --> 00:17:47,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">About a hundred years of military
experience between them.</font>

330
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you're the only one
that sees it the way it is.</font>

331
00:17:53,044 --> 00:17:57,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">I choose you.
You and 11 men.</font>

332
00:17:57,082 --> 00:17:58,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">Task Force Dagger.</font>

333
00:17:58,817 --> 00:18:01,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would be remiss
if I did not say to you,</font>

334
00:18:01,286 --> 00:18:03,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">even in success</font>

335
00:18:03,488 --> 00:18:04,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">the odds of you coming home...</font>

336
00:18:04,954 --> 00:18:08,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're 100%, sir,
with all due respect.</font>

337
00:18:08,227 --> 00:18:10,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, I kind of made
a promise, too.</font>

338
00:18:10,595 --> 00:18:11,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know better
than that, Nelson.</font>

339
00:18:11,962 --> 00:18:14,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What'd she get you to?
- Christmas.</font>

340
00:18:14,499 --> 00:18:16,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

341
00:18:16,034 --> 00:18:18,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a hell of a thing
we do, isn't it?</font>

342
00:18:18,403 --> 00:18:22,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you love your family
and leave them to go to war?</font>

343
00:18:22,775 --> 00:18:26,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're wheels up at 2200.
Dismissed.</font>

344
00:18:26,545 --> 00:18:29,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no. Knock that off. Go.</font>

345
00:18:30,248 --> 00:18:32,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Captain.</font>

346
00:18:34,719 --> 00:18:38,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">The most important thing a man can
take into combat is a reason why.</font>

347
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:43,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is from the towers.</font>

348
00:18:43,259 --> 00:18:46,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">You carry that with you.</font>

349
00:18:46,163 --> 00:18:49,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">Five weeks ago,
19 men attacked our country.</font>

350
00:18:49,233 --> 00:18:53,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">The 12 of you will be the
first ones to fight back.</font>

351
00:18:55,207 --> 00:18:56,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go win this thing.</font>

352
00:18:56,374 --> 00:18:58,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, sir.</font>

353
00:19:02,212 --> 00:19:03,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah!</font>

354
00:19:03,847 --> 00:19:05,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">Son of a bitch.
We're the first ones in!</font>

355
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, it's kind of like
the Apollo program.</font>

356
00:19:07,951 --> 00:19:09,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what they sent
into space first, right?</font>

357
00:19:09,922 --> 00:19:11,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- A monkey.</font>

358
00:19:11,323 --> 00:19:12,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great.</font>

359
00:19:12,457 --> 00:19:14,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, listen, brother.</font>

360
00:19:14,826 --> 00:19:16,459
<font color="#FFFFFF">If it's six weeks,
it's six weeks, okay?</font>

361
00:19:16,461 --> 00:19:18,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't rush this.</font>

362
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:20,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're in harm's way
no matter what the weather.</font>

363
00:19:20,329 --> 00:19:23,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">If your only goal
is trying to keep us alive,</font>

364
00:19:23,268 --> 00:19:24,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">we're dead men for sure.</font>

365
00:19:24,701 --> 00:19:27,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">I ain't losing one man
on this team, Hal.</font>

366
00:19:27,637 --> 00:19:29,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">The only way home is winning.</font>

367
00:19:31,608 --> 00:19:33,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, shit, I believe you.</font>

368
00:19:33,376 --> 00:19:36,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, let's tell the boys
we're up.</font>

369
00:19:46,423 --> 00:19:48,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God!</font>

370
00:19:48,894 --> 00:19:51,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">This woman
was stoned to death</font>

371
00:19:51,194 --> 00:19:53,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">for being pregnant
out of wedlock.</font>

372
00:19:53,065 --> 00:19:55,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is what the Taliban
does to women in Afghanistan.</font>

373
00:19:55,834 --> 00:19:58,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God,
just shut that shit off.</font>

374
00:19:58,635 --> 00:20:00,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's what they gave us
for intel.</font>

375
00:20:00,172 --> 00:20:02,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">But that's not intel,
that's motivation.</font>

376
00:20:02,007 --> 00:20:03,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I got two towers
full of that.</font>

377
00:20:03,607 --> 00:20:05,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, you don't need
to study, Falls.</font>

378
00:20:05,277 --> 00:20:07,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just shoot the guy
shooting at you.</font>

379
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:09,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, is that how that works? Thank
you very much, Mr. Wizard.</font>

380
00:20:09,646 --> 00:20:11,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, look, Michaels. It's you.</font>

381
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus Christ,
you guys are jealous.</font>

382
00:20:13,651 --> 00:20:16,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you call that? Is it
like a coif or something?</font>

383
00:20:16,453 --> 00:20:18,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Guys. Guys, guys.
- I don't do bad hair.</font>

384
00:20:18,655 --> 00:20:20,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen up!</font>

385
00:20:20,659 --> 00:20:22,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, boys.</font>

386
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:26,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's us, we're going in.</font>

387
00:20:26,096 --> 00:20:27,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah!</font>

388
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">We beat out
the five other teams.</font>

389
00:20:29,165 --> 00:20:30,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna drop in
behind enemy lines,</font>

390
00:20:30,969 --> 00:20:33,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">link up with a warlord
of the Northern Alliance,</font>

391
00:20:33,403 --> 00:20:35,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">General Abdul Dostum.</font>

392
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:37,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll assist him
in fighting the Taliban</font>

393
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:39,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">and taking back the city
of Mazar-I-Sharif,</font>

394
00:20:39,912 --> 00:20:41,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">which happens to be
the stronghold and linchpin</font>

395
00:20:41,747 --> 00:20:43,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">for the entire
northern Taliban force.</font>

396
00:20:43,949 --> 00:20:46,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now if we don't take
that city,</font>

397
00:20:46,151 --> 00:20:47,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">the whole country
will turn into</font>

398
00:20:47,786 --> 00:20:49,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">a goddamn terrorist
training camp.</font>

399
00:20:49,452 --> 00:20:51,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">World Trade Center's
just the beginning.</font>

400
00:20:51,355 --> 00:20:53,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're not finished
with us yet.</font>

401
00:20:53,191 --> 00:20:56,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">The catch is,
we only have 21 days.</font>

402
00:20:56,059 --> 00:20:57,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many troops does he have?</font>

403
00:20:57,827 --> 00:20:59,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's got about
200 paid soldiers</font>

404
00:20:59,396 --> 00:21:01,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">and an undetermined number
of part-time militia.</font>

405
00:21:01,665 --> 00:21:02,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about
the other side?</font>

406
00:21:02,901 --> 00:21:05,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">The other side
has about 50,000</font>

407
00:21:05,435 --> 00:21:07,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">Taliban and Al-Qaeda fighters.</font>

408
00:21:07,005 --> 00:21:09,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">Missiles, armor, rockets,</font>

409
00:21:09,007 --> 00:21:10,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">mortars, machine guns.</font>

410
00:21:10,807 --> 00:21:12,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're outnumbered.</font>

411
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:13,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just 5,000 to one.</font>

412
00:21:13,877 --> 00:21:15,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's what I call
a target-rich environment.</font>

413
00:21:15,413 --> 00:21:17,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">I kind of like those odds,
to be honest.</font>

414
00:21:17,048 --> 00:21:18,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, gentlemen,</font>

415
00:21:18,682 --> 00:21:20,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">once we land, we're about
nine hours away from help.</font>

416
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:24,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which effectively means it doesn't exist.
We're on our own.</font>

417
00:21:25,323 --> 00:21:27,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">We all need to understand</font>

418
00:21:27,393 --> 00:21:29,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">that capture is not
an option here.</font>

419
00:21:29,527 --> 00:21:31,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've all seen the intel
on what the Taliban does</font>

420
00:21:31,828 --> 00:21:33,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">to their prisoners, correct?</font>

421
00:21:33,832 --> 00:21:35,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those motherfuckers
will make you suffer.</font>

422
00:21:35,866 --> 00:21:38,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Shit goes south, I'm dying with my boots on.
- Amen.</font>

423
00:21:38,435 --> 00:21:40,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">- As am I.
- Hear, hear.</font>

424
00:21:40,172 --> 00:21:43,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">We go in tonight.
Single ship, no backup.</font>

425
00:21:43,008 --> 00:21:45,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">So police your gear,
get some rest.</font>

426
00:21:45,644 --> 00:21:47,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">Had a successful test flight?</font>

427
00:21:48,346 --> 00:21:50,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are the test flight.</font>

428
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you die,</font>

429
00:22:38,997 --> 00:22:43,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">that's a letter you and your
wife are gonna wish you wrote.</font>

430
00:22:43,201 --> 00:22:47,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just made her
a promise I'm coming home.</font>

431
00:22:47,137 --> 00:22:50,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">I ain't writing her a letter
that says I broke it.</font>

432
00:23:09,361 --> 00:23:11,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got one, two,</font>

433
00:23:11,828 --> 00:23:14,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">three, four,</font>

434
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:16,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">five, six...</font>

435
00:23:16,601 --> 00:23:18,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess that space suit
answers the question</font>

436
00:23:18,737 --> 00:23:20,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">about closing
the freaking doors.</font>

437
00:23:20,672 --> 00:23:22,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's your cruising altitude?</font>

438
00:23:22,207 --> 00:23:23,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a good question.</font>

439
00:23:23,909 --> 00:23:25,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it must be
above 10,000 feet</font>

440

flying over are 10,000 feet.</font>

442
00:23:29,548 --> 00:23:31,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">The sandstorms would
ruin the engines</font>

443
00:23:31,414 --> 00:23:33,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">and missiles have been fired
from the peaks.</font>

444
00:23:33,584 --> 00:23:35,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that puts us at 20.</font>

445
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,952

at 20,000 feet.</font>

how's this thing take it?</font>

450
00:23:43,993 --> 00:23:45,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll find out.</font>

451
00:23:45,461 --> 00:23:47,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is there O2 for my team?</font>

452
00:23:47,065 --> 00:23:48,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got masks in the
back, but they don't work.</font>

last flight.</font>

seeing bogeymen.</font>

455

the damn mountain.</font>

We're gonna go hypoxic.</font>

457

on that fucker right there.</font>

gentlemen.</font>

that worries me.</font>

on the other side.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, baby!</font>

469
00:24:20,463 --> 00:24:23,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, you know why the Army uses Chinooks, right?
- Why?</font>

470
00:24:23,201 --> 00:24:25,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we'll be good and mad
when we get into battle.</font>

00:30:05,942 --> 00:30:07,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">They call it the Alamo.</font>

take first watch.</font>

in the Alamo, right?</font>

535
00:30:20,589 --> 00:30:22,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you should
keep that to yourself.</font>

536
00:30:27,699 --> 00:30:30,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, this is great.</font>

537
00:30:30,166 --> 00:30:32,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, this is gonna go over
real well in a Muslim country.</font>

538
00:30:32,201 --> 00:30:35,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">It ain't our job to choose
the gifts, man. It's yours.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, feel free to eat
any of that.</font>

542
00:30:42,113 --> 00:30:44,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">The bread's good. I don't
know what this is,</font>

543
00:30:44,382 --> 00:30:46,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it's fucking great.</font>

544
00:30:46,115 --> 00:30:47,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me the lay of the land.</font>

545
00:30:47,585 --> 00:30:49,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">What kind of intel you got?</font>

546
00:30:49,287 --> 00:30:51,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, here's what
I know, and it ain't much.</font>

547
00:30:51,189 --> 00:30:52,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's left
of the Northern Alliance</font>

548
00:30:52,623 --> 00:30:54,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">is essentially
three separate militias.</font>

549
00:30:54,991 --> 00:30:57,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right? That are all
enemies with each other.</font>

550
00:30:57,094 --> 00:31:00,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">General Dostum, General Atta,
and General Mohaqiq.</font>

551
00:31:00,064 --> 00:31:02,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you got a three-pronged
attack that doesn't communicate,</font>

552
00:31:02,701 --> 00:31:04,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">will not assist each other.</font>

553
00:31:04,336 --> 00:31:05,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if they meet
on the battlefield,</font>

554
00:31:05,836 --> 00:31:07,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">they'll probably stop fighting
the Taliban</font>

555
00:31:07,505 --> 00:31:08,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">and start killing each other.</font>

556
00:31:08,873 --> 00:31:11,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about our contact,
General Dostum?</font>

557
00:31:11,142 --> 00:31:13,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">General Abdul Rashid Dostum.</font>

558
00:31:13,545 --> 00:31:15,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, he's Uzbek.</font>

559
00:31:15,814 --> 00:31:19,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">Started fighting the Russians
when he was 16. He's 55 now.</font>

560
00:31:19,584 --> 00:31:21,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, we have his bio.
What's he like?</font>

561
00:31:21,719 --> 00:31:23,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's he like?</font>

562
00:31:23,554 --> 00:31:26,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, what's he like? His personality.
Angry, happy, sad?</font>

563
00:31:26,089 --> 00:31:27,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">He likes show tunes.</font>

564
00:31:27,423 --> 00:31:28,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">He likes show tunes.
Great.</font>

565
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I read people
for a living,</font>

566
00:31:30,595 --> 00:31:32,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I can't get a bead
on this guy.</font>

567
00:31:32,328 --> 00:31:34,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay? Only two things
I know for sure.</font>

568
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:38,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">He hates the Taliban and they
hate the shit out of him.</font>

569
00:31:38,035 --> 00:31:40,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">How worried should we be
about any of these guys</font>

570
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:42,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">trying to sell us
to the Taliban?</font>

571
00:31:42,207 --> 00:31:45,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, I'd be pretty fucking
worried, if I was you.</font>

572
00:31:45,143 --> 00:31:46,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right.</font>

573
00:31:46,509 --> 00:31:48,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Does Dostum speak English?
- No.</font>

574
00:31:48,444 --> 00:31:50,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">He speaks Tajik.</font>

575
00:31:50,448 --> 00:31:51,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">He speaks Uzbek.</font>

576
00:31:51,949 --> 00:31:53,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">He speaks Dari.</font>

577
00:31:53,317 --> 00:31:56,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">He speaks Pashtun, which is
what the Taliban speak.</font>

578
00:31:56,118 --> 00:31:59,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he speaks Russian.
So you got that going for ya.</font>

579
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:00,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you with us through this?</font>

580
00:32:00,656 --> 00:32:02,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I'm leaving
right now.</font>

581
00:32:02,192 --> 00:32:03,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got a 50 kilometer hike</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Who knows, maybe we'll see
each other on the battlefield.</font>

584
00:32:08,665 --> 00:32:09,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we do,</font>

585
00:32:09,932 --> 00:32:12,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">don't shoot the guy
in the backwards cap.</font>

586
00:32:12,701 --> 00:32:14,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll keep that in mind.</font>

587
00:32:18,209 --> 00:32:20,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">God, that spook is cheery.</font>

588
00:32:20,309 --> 00:32:23,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, runnin' around here
alone, setting this thing up?</font>

589
00:32:23,512 --> 00:32:25,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say one thing about him,</font>

590
00:32:25,647 --> 00:32:27,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">he's got giant balls.</font>

591
00:32:29,487 --> 00:32:30,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

592
00:32:32,154 --> 00:32:34,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So where is he?
- Who?</font>

593
00:32:34,156 --> 00:32:36,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Dostum.
- No clue.</font>

594
00:32:36,692 --> 00:32:38,727
<font color="#FFFFFF">He knows
we're here though, right?</font>

595
00:32:38,729 --> 00:32:41,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whole fucking country knows
you're here.</font>

596
00:32:43,732 --> 00:32:45,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Best of luck, Captain.</font>

597
00:32:45,802 --> 00:32:47,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean it.</font>

598
00:32:47,136 --> 00:32:48,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">You too.</font>

599
00:32:48,306 --> 00:32:49,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give 'em hell.</font>

600
00:33:06,624 --> 00:33:08,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come look at this.</font>

601
00:33:08,991 --> 00:33:11,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">Graveyard of Empires,</font>

602
00:33:11,296 --> 00:33:14,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we're in it.</font>

603
00:33:14,265 --> 00:33:17,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shows you how unlucky it is
to write on that wall,</font>

604
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">so no one better do it.</font>

605
00:33:28,577 --> 00:33:30,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Cap.</font>

606
00:33:30,314 --> 00:33:31,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get some rest, all right?</font>

607
00:33:31,682 --> 00:33:33,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something ain't right here.</font>

608
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:35,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, look.</font>

609
00:33:35,184 --> 00:33:38,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is about being smart,
not super human.</font>

610
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:40,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I know, I know.</font>

611
00:33:40,223 --> 00:33:42,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna take the next watch.</font>

612
00:33:45,496 --> 00:33:47,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Massoud.</font>

613
00:33:47,365 --> 00:33:50,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">When he died, the Northern
Alliance might have died with him.</font>

614
00:34:12,757 --> 00:34:15,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">Move! Move!</font>

615
00:34:16,693 --> 00:34:19,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">That Dostum?</font>

616
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:51,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">General.</font>

617
00:34:51,393 --> 00:34:52,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peace be with you.</font>

618
00:35:03,875 --> 00:35:06,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what did he say?</font>

619
00:35:06,043 --> 00:35:08,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said it's good
to know the language of your enemies.</font>

620
00:35:27,831 --> 00:35:29,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">Am I doing this alone?</font>

621
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, let's go.</font>

622
00:35:30,768 --> 00:35:32,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like Spencer
got a promotion.</font>

623
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:34,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess he prefers brunettes.</font>

624
00:35:34,605 --> 00:35:36,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, seems that way, huh?</font>

625
00:35:55,291 --> 00:35:57,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, why don't we
give him the gift?</font>

626
00:36:16,748 --> 00:36:18,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm.</font>

627
00:36:23,454 --> 00:36:24,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did he say?</font>

628
00:36:24,989 --> 00:36:26,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think
the horse feed's a big hit.</font>

629
00:36:26,824 --> 00:36:29,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, that went over like a bag of shit.
- Mmm-hmm.</font>

630
00:36:29,994 --> 00:36:31,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanna try
the vodka, Captain?</font>

631
00:36:38,601 --> 00:36:40,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">General.</font>

632
00:36:55,418 --> 00:36:57,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">To our new American friends.</font>

633
00:37:02,293 --> 00:37:06,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope they don't think
they win copying the Russians.</font>

634
00:37:06,731 --> 00:37:08,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was told
you didn't speak English.</font>

635
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't speak to the man
who told you I don't.</font>

636
00:37:13,704 --> 00:37:15,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are my bombs?</font>

637
00:37:15,405 --> 00:37:18,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">General, I have more bombs
than you could ever want.</font>

638
00:37:18,342 --> 00:37:21,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Could you show me the Taliban's location?
- Why the young one speak?</font>

639
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:23,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's our captain, sir.</font>

640
00:37:26,181 --> 00:37:28,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Tell them to stand down.
- Hey, Diller.</font>

641
00:37:35,458 --> 00:37:39,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">General, I'm the captain.
This is my team.</font>

642
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:42,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">You speak to me, all right?</font>

643
00:37:42,166 --> 00:37:44,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This is my country.
- I understand that.</font>

644
00:37:44,168 --> 00:37:47,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">You own the land,
but we own the sky.</font>

645
00:37:47,637 --> 00:37:49,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want our bombs,
talk to me.</font>

646
00:37:51,242 --> 00:37:52,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

647
00:37:52,643 --> 00:37:54,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">We talk.</font>

648
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:58,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why these men follow you?</font>

649
00:37:58,047 --> 00:38:00,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could ask you
the same question.</font>

650
00:38:00,083 --> 00:38:02,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't want the answer.</font>

651
00:38:03,353 --> 00:38:04,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look.</font>

652
00:38:05,289 --> 00:38:07,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look. Those eyes.</font>

653
00:38:08,326 --> 00:38:09,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Killer eyes.</font>

654
00:38:14,431 --> 00:38:15,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those eyes.</font>

655
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">Killer eyes.</font>

656
00:38:18,735 --> 00:38:20,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

657
00:38:20,605 --> 00:38:22,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">Killer eyes.</font>

658
00:38:23,239 --> 00:38:26,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did you kill?</font>

659
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:29,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanna see me kill?</font>

660
00:38:29,213 --> 00:38:31,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">You take me to the Taliban,
I'll show you.</font>

661
00:38:36,253 --> 00:38:38,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. We go.</font>

662
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:42,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was easy.</font>

663
00:38:44,594 --> 00:38:46,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">Buddy, you better check
that fucking swagger</font>

664
00:38:46,864 --> 00:38:48,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">before he sells us
to the highest bidder.</font>

665
00:38:48,766 --> 00:38:52,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, he needed to know how far
I can be pushed. Now he does.</font>

666
00:38:52,068 --> 00:38:54,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fucking killer's eyes.</font>

667
00:38:58,208 --> 00:39:01,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">General. General, how far
away is the Taliban?</font>

668
00:39:02,179 --> 00:39:06,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">Five hours.
I have horses for you.</font>

669
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:09,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">- There's only six. I need 12. I got 12 men.
- I have six.</font>

670
00:39:11,289 --> 00:39:12,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Cap.</font>

671
00:39:12,657 --> 00:39:14,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like he's not done
pushing you.</font>

672
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't like
splitting up the team, Hal.</font>

673
00:39:18,393 --> 00:39:20,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it was bound to happen sooner
or later, might as well be now.</font>

674
00:39:20,465 --> 00:39:22,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">At least
he's willing to fight.</font>

675
00:39:22,297 --> 00:39:25,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">I figured he'd just milk us
for supplies and money.</font>

676
00:39:27,304 --> 00:39:31,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you show me on the map
exactly where we're going?</font>

677
00:39:31,074 --> 00:39:33,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cobaki. Over the mountains.</font>

678
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, Diller,
Coffers, Michaels,</font>

679
00:39:37,947 --> 00:39:39,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bennett, Jackson,
you're with me.</font>

680
00:39:39,583 --> 00:39:42,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">Falls, Black, grab the
daypacks, extra ammo.</font>

681
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:47,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">I took Dehi four days ago
from Taliban.</font>

682
00:39:47,525 --> 00:39:50,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mullah Razzan,
leader of the Taliban,</font>

683
00:39:50,193 --> 00:39:52,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">has a high price
on your heads.</font>

684
00:39:52,262 --> 00:39:56,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">100,000 US dollars
for your body.</font>

685
00:39:56,166 --> 00:39:58,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">50,000 for your
bloody uniforms.</font>

686
00:39:58,835 --> 00:40:00,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's it?</font>

687
00:40:02,306 --> 00:40:03,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">A little low.</font>

688
00:40:03,739 --> 00:40:05,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Toss a little change out,
Taliban.</font>

689
00:40:05,242 --> 00:40:07,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well,
look on the bright side.</font>

690
00:40:07,177 --> 00:40:08,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">If his plan was to cash us in,</font>

691
00:40:08,612 --> 00:40:10,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">he'd find another
six horses for sure.</font>

692
00:40:10,447 --> 00:40:12,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guarantee it.</font>

693
00:40:12,181 --> 00:40:14,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, who's ridden before?
Anyone?</font>

694
00:40:14,818 --> 00:40:16,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">Summer camp,
when I was nine.</font>

695
00:40:16,353 --> 00:40:19,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cancun, spring break.
But I was pretty drunk.</font>

696
00:40:19,922 --> 00:40:21,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't ride for shit.</font>

697
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:22,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay,
so that's nobody.</font>

698
00:40:22,726 --> 00:40:26,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, hey, this will be fun.
All right.</font>

699
00:40:28,231 --> 00:40:31,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, so a kick means "go."
This is the steering wheel.</font>

700
00:40:31,668 --> 00:40:33,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">Left to go left,</font>

701
00:40:33,235 --> 00:40:35,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">- right to go right. Pull back to stop.
- Okay.</font>

702
00:40:35,505 --> 00:40:37,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not waiting for us.
Saddle up.</font>

703
00:40:37,641 --> 00:40:39,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll start
a supply chain, okay?</font>

704
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:41,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">Schedule a drop.</font>

705
00:40:41,077 --> 00:40:42,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does it have a name?</font>

706
00:40:42,512 --> 00:40:43,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">Request ammo
for Dostum's men.</font>

707
00:40:43,813 --> 00:40:45,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know,
but does it have a name?</font>

708
00:40:45,215 --> 00:40:46,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Michaels will be
on the radio.</font>

709
00:40:46,416 --> 00:40:47,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll check in
every four hours.</font>

710
00:40:47,951 --> 00:40:49,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's gonna test you.</font>

711
00:40:49,085 --> 00:40:50,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. I'm gonna test him, too.</font>

712
00:40:50,454 --> 00:40:52,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not sure
that's a good idea.</font>

713
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:55,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">About to find out.</font>

714
00:40:55,458 --> 00:40:58,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, fuck. God damn it.</font>

715
00:40:58,527 --> 00:40:59,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good luck, boys.</font>

716
00:40:59,896 --> 00:41:02,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys look like
a bunch of naturals.</font>

717
00:41:02,199 --> 00:41:03,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't break
the horse, Dill.</font>

718
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shit.</font>

719
00:44:27,036 --> 00:44:30,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't like how
they're looking at us, Cap.</font>

720
00:44:31,742 --> 00:44:34,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cap, we got three AK's and
a spotter at three o'clock.</font>

721
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I see it.</font>

722
00:44:43,686 --> 00:44:45,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the fuck
are we stopping for?</font>

723
00:44:45,188 --> 00:44:46,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

724
00:44:50,793 --> 00:44:52,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">Supplies.</font>

725
00:44:52,228 --> 00:44:54,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well,
we're sitting ducks here.</font>

726
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:55,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">You gotta be
kidding me.</font>

727
00:44:55,731 --> 00:44:58,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">Risking our asses
for 10 gallons of water.</font>

728
00:44:58,434 --> 00:45:00,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">No,
he's showing us off.</font>

729
00:45:00,471 --> 00:45:02,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's saying,
"Look at the Americans.</font>

730
00:45:02,206 --> 00:45:03,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">"They're here with me."</font>

731
00:45:18,121 --> 00:45:20,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, don't fucking look down!</font>

732
00:45:20,056 --> 00:45:21,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where you look,
the horse goes.</font>

733
00:45:21,757 --> 00:45:23,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">Move your head,
it shifts your weight</font>

734
00:45:23,393 --> 00:45:25,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">and shifts the horse's weight.
Got it?</font>

735
00:45:25,795 --> 00:45:27,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, yeah, I got it.</font>

736
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:49,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey, boss.
- Yeah.</font>

737
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:53,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's got us on the north side

Where's Nelson?</font>

off radio reception.</font>

814
00:49:18,193 --> 00:49:22,329

en route to Dostum's HQ.</font>

816
00:49:25,235 --> 00:49:27,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, hold on. Why aren't
Nelson and Spencer together?</font>

817
00:49:27,704 --> 00:49:30,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nelson split the team.
He took six men</font>

818
00:49:30,072 --> 00:49:33,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">and left Spencer and
the others at the recon point.</font>

819
00:49:33,076 --> 00:49:34,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">Christ, why'd he do that?</font>

820
00:49:34,610 --> 00:49:36,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dostum only gave him
six horses.</font>

821
00:49:36,313 --> 00:49:38,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">Apparently, that's the only
way to cross the mountains.</font>

822
00:49:38,146 --> 00:49:39,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">According to Spencer,</font>

823
00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:41,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">the horses aren't
just transportation.</font>

824
00:49:41,784 --> 00:49:44,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">Spencer says Dostum
relies on them for combat.</font>

825
00:49:44,987 --> 00:49:46,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">Horses?</font>

826
00:49:46,356 --> 00:49:47,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, sir.</font>

827
00:49:55,364 --> 00:49:58,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">There. Mullah Razzan's men.</font>

828
00:49:58,835 --> 00:50:00,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, where?</font>

829
00:50:01,338 --> 00:50:04,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see
the pickup trucks?</font>

830
00:50:04,239 --> 00:50:07,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those are the Taliban forces
outside of Bescham.</font>

831
00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:09,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right. Okay, General,
let me explain how this works.</font>

832
00:50:09,846 --> 00:50:12,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to be close enough to give the
exact coordinates and elevation.</font>

833
00:50:12,581 --> 00:50:13,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's too dangerous.</font>

834
00:50:13,916 --> 00:50:15,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">General, we're too far away.</font>

835
00:50:15,318 --> 00:50:16,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't call in anything
from here.</font>

836
00:50:16,719 --> 00:50:19,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">500 of my men can die</font>

837
00:50:19,054 --> 00:50:22,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">before one American gets
a scratch. You know why?</font>

838
00:50:22,492 --> 00:50:23,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, why, sir?</font>

839
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because if one American die,</font>

840
00:50:25,661 --> 00:50:28,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">your government leaves,
and then we lose the war.</font>

841
00:50:28,431 --> 00:50:31,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. I'm dropping these bombs
from 30,000 feet.</font>

842
00:50:31,902 --> 00:50:34,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">The plane doesn't guide
the bombs, I do.</font>

843
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:36,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I can't get close enough, I
can't call in the exact location.</font>

844
00:50:36,139 --> 00:50:37,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me your little map.</font>

845
00:50:37,407 --> 00:50:38,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me your map.</font>

846
00:50:41,878 --> 00:50:45,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">There. See?
Here. Taliban.</font>

847
00:50:45,481 --> 00:50:46,981

848
00:50:46,983 --> 00:50:50,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay.

849
00:50:50,585 --> 00:50:52,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now drop your bomb.</font>

850
00:50:52,289 --> 00:50:54,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He's not getting it.
- And we're still too far away.</font>

851
00:50:54,190 --> 00:50:56,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Drop bombs.
- How do I even know this is the Taliban?</font>

852
00:50:56,626 --> 00:50:58,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who else would it be?</font>

853
00:50:58,228 --> 00:50:59,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are a lot of armies
in these mountains, General,</font>

854
00:50:59,896 --> 00:51:02,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the U.S. is only at war
with one of them.</font>

856
00:51:04,166 --> 00:51:05,867

I'm just saying</font>

00:54:05,347 --> 00:54:07,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">Captain, there's an element
moving in on you.</font>

886
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, stay here.
Let's go!</font>

887
00:54:54,097 --> 00:54:57,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll say again. 8-3-9...</font>

888
00:54:58,367 --> 00:55:00,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">6-4-5-7.</font>

889
00:55:03,739 --> 00:55:05,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clear and hot.</font>

890
00:55:07,911 --> 00:55:10,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bombs inbound, boys.
Let's move!</font>

891
00:55:13,148 --> 00:55:14,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're danger close, Cap!</font>

892
00:55:14,717 --> 00:55:16,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">Move back! Move!</font>

893
00:55:19,489 --> 00:55:20,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">Move! Move!</font>

894
00:55:52,255 --> 00:55:53,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">General.</font>

895
00:55:53,356 --> 00:55:55,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">Their forward position's
obliterated.</font>

896
00:55:55,257 --> 00:55:57,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why aren't we moving
on the village?</font>

897
00:55:57,159 --> 00:55:58,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will not
live long here</font>

898
00:55:58,527 --> 00:56:00,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you ignore
what I'm telling you.</font>

899
00:56:00,163 --> 00:56:01,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">You told me to bomb,
that's what I did.</font>

900
00:56:01,697 --> 00:56:02,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why aren't we attacking?</font>

901
00:56:02,831 --> 00:56:04,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">That wasn't the plan today.</font>

902
00:56:04,534 --> 00:56:06,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">You mind telling me the plan?</font>

903
00:56:07,804 --> 00:56:09,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">We attack tomorrow.</font>

904
00:56:11,875 --> 00:56:14,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tomorrow. Great.
So that was, uh, what?</font>

905
00:56:14,043 --> 00:56:15,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice little dress rehearsal?</font>

906
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:18,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">A rehearsal, yeah. Great.</font>

907
00:56:38,534 --> 00:56:40,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not gonna negotiate.</font>

908
00:56:40,603 --> 00:56:42,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">These are my boots.</font>

909
00:56:42,038 --> 00:56:44,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, the ones you stole
from our drop?</font>

910
00:56:46,208 --> 00:56:47,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know what that means.</font>

911
00:56:47,943 --> 00:56:50,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">I bet you we haven't
even found half our shit.</font>

912
00:56:50,313 --> 00:56:51,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

913
00:56:53,150 --> 00:56:55,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah. That roof
looks familiar, doesn't it?</font>

914
00:56:56,052 --> 00:56:58,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, how much, huh?</font>

915
00:57:00,188 --> 00:57:02,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is that? $10? $9.50?</font>

916
00:57:02,724 --> 00:57:04,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh?</font>

917
00:57:04,827 --> 00:57:08,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">They got 10% of our MREs,
a quarter of our blankets.</font>

918
00:57:08,231 --> 00:57:10,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're missing a lot.</font>

919
00:57:12,902 --> 00:57:14,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

920
00:57:19,041 --> 00:57:20,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guess they like
our chem suits.</font>

921
00:57:20,842 --> 00:57:22,277
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Très chic.</i></font>

922
00:57:51,206 --> 00:57:52,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd like to tell you
it gets easier, but...</font>

923
00:58:00,717 --> 00:58:03,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, every now and then,</font>

924
00:58:03,452 --> 00:58:06,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">you meet a guy
who doesn't feel anything.</font>

925
00:58:07,422 --> 00:58:11,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">He goes out there,
he kills people.</font>

926
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:15,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">Falls asleep before his head
hits the pillow.</font>

927
00:58:15,898 --> 00:58:20,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I used to think that
that'd be better, right?</font>

928
00:58:21,268 --> 00:58:23,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">That maybe
I was just too weak.</font>

929
00:58:25,474 --> 00:58:26,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I realized...</font>

930
00:58:27,242 --> 00:58:29,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nah.</font>

931
00:58:29,878 --> 00:58:33,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the thing that
reminds us that we're humans.</font>

932
00:58:54,969 --> 00:58:56,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, here we go.</font>

933
00:58:56,773 --> 00:58:58,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">How'd you make out?</font>

934
00:58:58,239 --> 00:58:59,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">All kinds of goodies.</font>

935
00:58:59,675 --> 00:59:01,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good. Get most of it back?</font>

936
00:59:01,376 --> 00:59:02,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was like shopping
at Macy's.</font>

937
00:59:02,978 --> 00:59:04,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey, yo, Spence, bro.
- Yeah.</font>

938
00:59:04,213 --> 00:59:05,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">See that little kid
over there?</font>

939
00:59:05,882 --> 00:59:06,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

940
00:59:06,983 --> 00:59:08,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't even take a piss</font>

941
00:59:08,351 --> 00:59:10,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">without the kid
up in my business.</font>

942
00:59:10,353 --> 00:59:12,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it is
pretty fascinating.</font>

943
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:13,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, not really. It's not.</font>

944
00:59:13,922 --> 00:59:16,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. He follows me around
like a little stray dog, bro.</font>

945
00:59:16,592 --> 00:59:18,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you stop
giving him treats?</font>

946
00:59:18,594 --> 00:59:20,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bro, that's the thing. I don't
give him shit, all right?</font>

947
00:59:20,262 --> 00:59:21,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">He just follows me
around smiling</font>

948
00:59:21,697 --> 00:59:23,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">with his little 1910 gun, bro.</font>

949
00:59:23,199 --> 00:59:24,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't get it, do you?</font>

950
00:59:25,134 --> 00:59:27,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, Spence?</font>

951
00:59:27,268 --> 00:59:29,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">These guys guard us.</font>

952
00:59:29,771 --> 00:59:31,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any one of us gets killed,</font>

953
00:59:31,507 --> 00:59:33,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dostum might execute the man
he thinks is responsible</font>

954
00:59:33,943 --> 00:59:36,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">and his whole family.</font>

955
00:59:36,344 --> 00:59:39,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">And this poor boy got you.</font>

956
00:59:41,784 --> 00:59:43,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">So be nice.</font>

957
00:59:43,318 --> 00:59:44,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be nice.</font>

958
00:59:49,159 --> 00:59:50,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, uh, Najeeb?</font>

959
00:59:52,262 --> 00:59:55,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here, bro,
I got you a little...</font>

960
00:59:55,164 --> 00:59:58,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a little sucker.
Put it in your mouth.</font>

961
01:00:03,438 --> 01:00:06,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no!
You take the thing off it.</font>

962
01:00:06,708 --> 01:00:09,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then you put it
in your mouth. Yeah.</font>

963
01:00:09,713 --> 01:00:11,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put it in your mouth. Yeah.</font>

964
01:00:11,447 --> 01:00:14,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't even fucking go there,
bro. Don't go there, bro.</font>

965
01:00:14,550 --> 01:00:16,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Give me my shoes.
- That's cute.</font>

966
01:00:16,117 --> 01:00:18,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Shut up.
- It's cute.</font>

967
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:20,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is their
next objective, Bescham.</font>

968
01:00:20,556 --> 01:00:24,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's only one way in,
and the Taliban know it.</font>

969
01:00:24,193 --> 01:00:26,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're dug in hard
just outside of town</font>

970
01:00:26,262 --> 01:00:28,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">right here, heavily fortified.</font>

971
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:29,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">The whole fucking thing's
a buzzsaw, sir.</font>

972
01:00:29,664 --> 01:00:32,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, then why the hell is
Nelson walking into it?</font>

973
01:00:32,434 --> 01:00:33,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shit.</font>

974
01:00:34,402 --> 01:00:36,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did I pick the wrong guy?</font>

975
01:00:36,039 --> 01:00:39,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir, this one's not on Nelson.
It's geography.</font>

976
01:00:39,641 --> 01:00:42,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bescham is the only way
to Mazari.</font>

977
01:00:42,610 --> 01:00:45,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, maybe so. But we can't
pin all our hopes on Nelson.</font>

978
01:00:45,347 --> 01:00:47,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's get a second team
in the works.</font>

979
01:00:47,349 --> 01:00:49,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">If Dostum doesn't make it
to Bescham</font>

980
01:00:49,052 --> 01:00:51,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">by the time
the weather sets in,</font>

981
01:00:51,454 --> 01:00:53,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's gonna be a real shitshow.</font>

982
01:00:59,494 --> 01:01:02,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">General,
B-52s are in position.</font>

983
01:01:05,367 --> 01:01:07,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have any idea
what's going on?</font>

984
01:01:07,670 --> 01:01:09,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dostum need to find out if his
nephew still over there,</font>

985
01:01:09,539 --> 01:01:11,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">fighting along with Taliban.</font>

986
01:01:11,340 --> 01:01:12,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Many switch sides.</font>

987
01:01:12,907 --> 01:01:17,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">For necessity, loyalty change.
Some every other week.</font>

988
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:19,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why the hell
would they do that?</font>

989
01:01:19,148 --> 01:01:21,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">A lot of these guys
are farmers.</font>

990
01:01:21,114 --> 01:01:22,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">Taliban comes through,</font>

991
01:01:22,518 --> 01:01:23,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">they torture, murder,
force them to fight.</font>

992
01:01:23,751 --> 01:01:25,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">What choice do they have?</font>

993
01:01:26,822 --> 01:01:28,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it just me
or does it feel like</font>

994
01:01:28,956 --> 01:01:32,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">these assholes are counting their
money every time they look at us?</font>

995
01:01:37,666 --> 01:01:38,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">General.</font>

996
01:01:41,603 --> 01:01:44,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">His nephew left this morning.
We can proceed.</font>

997
01:01:44,072 --> 01:01:47,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Great.
War's back on, guys.</font>

998
01:01:47,576 --> 01:01:49,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">General, we're minutes
from range.</font>

999
01:01:49,679 --> 01:01:51,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is there anything you can tell me
so I can better prepare my men</font>

1000
01:01:51,514 --> 01:01:52,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">- to assist you?
- Very good.</font>

1001
01:01:57,385 --> 01:01:59,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know if horses
were the best idea today.</font>

1002
01:01:59,322 --> 01:02:01,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">The bombs are gonna
scare them bad.</font>

1003
01:02:01,458 --> 01:02:04,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">The horses know
that these are American bombs.</font>

1004
01:02:04,226 --> 01:02:05,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">They won't be afraid.</font>

1005
01:02:05,793 --> 01:02:10,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, they know that
they're American bombs. Okay.</font>

1006
01:02:10,565 --> 01:02:12,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">Makes sense.</font>

1007
01:02:12,467 --> 01:02:14,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wookie-99, new grid.</font>

stay here!</font>

did those come from?</font>

1014
01:03:25,940 --> 01:03:28,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did Dostum not know
about a supply line?</font>

1015
01:03:33,414 --> 01:03:35,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wookie-99,
we need a drop.</font>

I'm staring at a company</font>

1018
01:03:38,554 --> 01:03:40,152

We gotta cover their retreat.</font>

1021
01:04:18,659 --> 01:04:21,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">Michaels, Coffers,
base element.</font>

1022

Fall back!</font>

1025
01:05:20,922 --> 01:05:21,822

01:06:00,862 --> 01:06:03,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's move him up. Up there.</font>

1034
01:06:15,744 --> 01:06:19,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">General, you know
this area, right?</font>

1035
01:06:19,748 --> 01:06:21,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right? Which means you knew</font>

1036
01:06:21,451 --> 01:06:23,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">about the Taliban's
supply line,</font>

1037
01:06:23,085 --> 01:06:24,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you didn't tell me.</font>

1038
01:06:24,387 --> 01:06:26,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I had known,
if you had told me,</font>

1039
01:06:26,188 --> 01:06:28,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could have hit that column
before they ever made it to us.</font>

1040
01:06:30,358 --> 01:06:32,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you wanna kill
your own men, that's fine.</font>

1041
01:06:32,061 --> 01:06:33,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I ain't letting you put
my men</font>

1042
01:06:33,429 --> 01:06:34,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">in harm's way, you understand?</font>

1043
01:06:34,931 --> 01:06:36,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everywhere you go
is harm's way.</font>

1044
01:06:36,632 --> 01:06:39,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">No shit.</font>

1045
01:06:39,101 --> 01:06:43,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're fighting with horsemen
against tanks.</font>

1046
01:06:43,005 --> 01:06:45,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have an obligation to
tell me everything you know.</font>

1047
01:06:45,106 --> 01:06:47,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have a stomach
for everything I know.</font>

1048
01:06:47,242 --> 01:06:48,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, fuck.</font>

1049
01:06:48,677 --> 01:06:50,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will not win here</font>

1050
01:06:50,445 --> 01:06:52,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">because you are not honest
with yourself.</font>

1051
01:06:53,382 --> 01:06:56,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">You expect victory
without blood.</font>

1052
01:06:56,284 --> 01:06:59,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">I expect you to share
strategic information with us.</font>

1053
01:06:59,521 --> 01:07:01,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">Otherwise what the fuck
are we doing here?</font>

1054
01:07:01,356 --> 01:07:03,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your anger
comes from your fear</font>

1055
01:07:03,358 --> 01:07:04,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">because you live in a place</font>

1056
01:07:04,893 --> 01:07:07,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">where life looks better
than afterlife.</font>

1057
01:07:07,396 --> 01:07:09,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not this place.</font>

1058
01:07:09,164 --> 01:07:12,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here, Taliban kills everything
you live for.</font>

1059
01:07:13,601 --> 01:07:16,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your mission will fail
because you fear death.</font>

1060
01:07:18,407 --> 01:07:21,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mullah Razzan's men,
the Taliban,</font>

1061
01:07:21,510 --> 01:07:23,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">they welcome it.</font>

1062
01:07:23,512 --> 01:07:27,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because they believe there is
riches waiting for them in Heaven.</font>

1063
01:07:27,681 --> 01:07:30,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me the goddamn
information I need,</font>

1064
01:07:30,085 --> 01:07:32,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'll reward
every last one of them.</font>

1065
01:07:35,324 --> 01:07:36,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">General, I'm your link</font>

1066
01:07:36,958 --> 01:07:39,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">to the greatest weaponry in
the history of civilization.</font>

1067
01:07:39,061 --> 01:07:42,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">You gotta stop guarding me
and start trusting me.</font>

1068
01:07:42,998 --> 01:07:47,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Greatest weapon
in history is this.</font>

1069
01:07:47,670 --> 01:07:49,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't have soldiers
in my army,</font>

1070
01:07:49,771 --> 01:07:51,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">not one. Only warriors.</font>

1071
01:07:53,375 --> 01:07:56,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop being a soldier.</font>

1072
01:07:56,878 --> 01:08:01,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">Start using this,
and you can be a warrior, too.</font>

1073
01:08:21,368 --> 01:08:23,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come with me.</font>

1074
01:08:44,091 --> 01:08:45,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sit.</font>

1075
01:08:48,796 --> 01:08:52,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">They bring their weapons
through Tiangi Gap.</font>

1076
01:08:52,935 --> 01:08:55,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">Out here, there's nothing.</font>

1077
01:08:55,002 --> 01:08:58,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">No passage, no water.
No shade.</font>

1078
01:08:58,573 --> 01:09:01,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">So the only way
to Mazar-I-Sharif</font>

1079
01:09:01,274 --> 01:09:03,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">is through Tiangi Gap.</font>

1080
01:09:03,377 --> 01:09:04,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a choke point.</font>

1081
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:07,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the only way.</font>

1082
01:09:07,282 --> 01:09:08,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, for us to take Mazar,</font>

1083
01:09:08,684 --> 01:09:10,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">- we'll have to beat him in this Gap.
- Yes.</font>

1084
01:09:10,252 --> 01:09:13,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">To get access to their
stronghold in Tiangi,</font>

1085
01:09:13,555 --> 01:09:15,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">we must first take Bescham.</font>

1086
01:09:17,859 --> 01:09:20,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, you have the sky,</font>

1087
01:09:20,996 --> 01:09:23,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">but wars are won in the dirt.</font>

1088
01:09:25,533 --> 01:09:27,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew
about their supply line.</font>

1089
01:09:27,770 --> 01:09:30,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I didn't expect
their weapons.</font>

1090
01:09:31,340 --> 01:09:34,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fakir was my godson.</font>

1091
01:09:37,011 --> 01:09:38,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every time you lose a man,</font>

1092
01:09:38,814 --> 01:09:40,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's like a stab
in your heart.</font>

1093
01:09:43,152 --> 01:09:46,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">And my heart is butchered,
my friend.</font>

1094
01:09:46,988 --> 01:09:50,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't think I send my men
out there to die.</font>

1095
01:09:53,929 --> 01:09:56,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to win you
this thing, I swear to God.</font>

1096
01:10:01,537 --> 01:10:03,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe you.</font>

1097
01:10:03,872 --> 01:10:05,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now see,
the Taliban won't be</font>

1098
01:10:05,474 --> 01:10:06,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">defending
their western flank</font>

1099
01:10:06,841 --> 01:10:08,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">because they can't
imagine anything</font>

1100
01:10:08,243 --> 01:10:09,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">coming from this desert.</font>

1101
01:10:09,779 --> 01:10:11,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, it's a crazy idea, but...</font>

1102
01:10:11,613 --> 01:10:12,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">But what?</font>

1103
01:10:12,846 --> 01:10:14,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well,
the Taliban reinforcements</font>

1104
01:10:14,250 --> 01:10:16,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">come through here.
Through the Tiangi Gap.</font>

1105
01:10:16,716 --> 01:10:19,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is why Dostum's killing
himself trying to move forward.</font>

1106
01:10:19,886 --> 01:10:21,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">All the Taliban has to do</font>

1107
01:10:21,523 --> 01:10:24,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">is hold him off long enough
to bring in more artillery.</font>

1108
01:10:24,591 --> 01:10:28,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's nothing out there.
There's no water, no nothing.</font>

1109
01:10:28,029 --> 01:10:31,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">When you come in behind their
line, you cut that chain.</font>

1110
01:10:31,166 --> 01:10:33,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ammo dumps, convoys, anything
you can hit, you hit it.</font>

1111
01:10:33,435 --> 01:10:36,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I walk it? I'm sick
of that fucking horse.</font>

1112
01:10:36,505 --> 01:10:38,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">Diller, it's
120 klicks or something.</font>

1113
01:10:38,739 --> 01:10:42,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">A drop would give up your position.
You gotta pack everything in.</font>

1114
01:10:42,845 --> 01:10:44,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can Dostum give us some mules?</font>

1115
01:10:44,412 --> 01:10:46,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, probably.
- Okay.</font>

1116
01:10:46,082 --> 01:10:47,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">But listen, whoever does this
thing has got to understand,</font>

1117
01:10:47,814 --> 01:10:49,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">this is different than what
we've been doing, all right?</font>

1118
01:10:49,850 --> 01:10:51,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're on your own.
No reinforcements,</font>

1119
01:10:51,618 --> 01:10:53,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">no extraction, nothing.</font>

1120
01:10:55,224 --> 01:10:58,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shit, I can't order
anyone to do this.</font>

1121
01:10:58,091 --> 01:10:59,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone's got to volunteer.</font>

1122
01:11:00,529 --> 01:11:01,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, you can.</font>

1123
01:11:01,930 --> 01:11:03,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just give us the order.</font>

1124
01:11:08,237 --> 01:11:09,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's an order.</font>

1125
01:11:09,203 --> 01:11:11,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothin' I'd rather do.</font>

1126
01:11:11,305 --> 01:11:14,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Now pick two guys.
- Bennett.</font>

1127
01:11:14,207 --> 01:11:16,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm in.
- Coffers?</font>

1128
01:11:16,278 --> 01:11:19,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I thought you'd never ask.
Thank you, sir.</font>

1129
01:11:19,515 --> 01:11:20,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, thank you.</font>

1130
01:11:22,015 --> 01:11:23,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good luck, Bennett.</font>

1131
01:11:23,219 --> 01:11:24,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give 'em hell, buddy.</font>

1132
01:11:24,853 --> 01:11:27,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess the best-looking
fellas get the choice...</font>

1133
01:11:36,363 --> 01:11:38,832
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>595 Bravo, come in.</i></font>

1134
01:11:40,301 --> 01:11:41,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go for Bravo.</font>

1135
01:11:41,670 --> 01:11:42,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, did you guys get horses?</font>

1136
01:11:42,871 --> 01:11:44,003
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Yes.</i></font>

1137
01:11:44,006 --> 01:11:45,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, good.
Ride up to us.</font>

1138
01:11:45,907 --> 01:11:48,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">I split the team again,
sent Diller downrange.</font>

1139
01:11:48,609 --> 01:11:50,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">Roger that. On our way.</font>

1140
01:12:05,292 --> 01:12:08,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome
to the Ritz, boys.</font>

1141
01:12:08,261 --> 01:12:11,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">Valet will take your horses
in the back.</font>

1142
01:12:11,064 --> 01:12:13,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Came all the way
up here for this?</font>

1143
01:12:13,033 --> 01:12:14,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's the pool?</font>

1144
01:12:14,368 --> 01:12:15,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">Trying to work
on my suntan, bro.</font>

1145
01:12:15,837 --> 01:12:17,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think my massage
is at 4:00.</font>

1146
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:20,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa, whoa.</font>

1147
01:12:20,042 --> 01:12:21,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell happened
to Spencer?</font>

1148
01:12:21,274 --> 01:12:23,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, he was right
behind us, Cap.</font>

1149
01:12:23,546 --> 01:12:24,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

1150
01:12:24,845 --> 01:12:26,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shit.</font>

1151
01:12:26,715 --> 01:12:28,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You all right?
- Oh, yeah.</font>

1152
01:12:28,350 --> 01:12:31,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I'm fine. I gotta get
off this goddamn horse.</font>

1153
01:12:31,987 --> 01:12:34,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's his back.
He slipped a disc, I think.</font>

1154
01:12:34,421 --> 01:12:35,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

1155
01:12:36,524 --> 01:12:38,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me your...</font>

1156
01:12:38,627 --> 01:12:40,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got you. Okay.</font>

1157
01:12:40,462 --> 01:12:42,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh. Oh!
- Easy.</font>

1158
01:12:42,229 --> 01:12:43,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Jesus Christ!
- Fuck!</font>

1159
01:12:43,797 --> 01:12:45,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fucking heavy.</font>

1160
01:12:46,234 --> 01:12:47,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry.</font>

1161
01:12:47,234 --> 01:12:49,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're all right. You're good.</font>

1162
01:12:49,569 --> 01:12:52,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, listen. Diller,
he missed his first check-in.</font>

1163
01:12:52,073 --> 01:12:54,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it's the mountains.
No reception, right?</font>

1164
01:12:54,510 --> 01:12:55,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, maybe.</font>

1165
01:12:55,710 --> 01:12:57,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where'd you send him?</font>

1166
01:12:57,045 --> 01:12:58,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's flanking
their supply route.</font>

1167
01:12:58,581 --> 01:12:59,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Risky.</font>

1168
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:01,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">Little bit.</font>

1169
01:13:01,149 --> 01:13:03,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, the band's
back together.</font>

1170
01:13:03,385 --> 01:13:06,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus, chief,
you look like my grandpa.</font>

1171
01:13:06,988 --> 01:13:09,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">20 bucks if you can
stand up straight.</font>

1172
01:13:09,555 --> 01:13:11,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can keep that $20.</font>

1173
01:13:11,961 --> 01:13:14,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, the best thing about
calling in airstrikes,</font>

1174
01:13:14,729 --> 01:13:16,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">you can do it
laying down, right?</font>

1175
01:13:16,596 --> 01:13:17,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right.</font>

1176
01:13:17,832 --> 01:13:20,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's get this war started!</font>

1177
01:13:48,063 --> 01:13:49,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">So far all clear, Cap.</font>

1178
01:14:28,368 --> 01:14:29,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

1179

01:26:18,479 --> 01:26:21,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are thousands of people
dead in your country and mine.</font>

1326
01:26:21,114 --> 01:26:23,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now let me show you
how this is possible.</font>

1327
01:26:23,783 --> 01:26:26,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right? We've already
lured them into this Gap.</font>

1328
01:26:26,854 --> 01:26:28,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna put a man
on each flank,</font>

1329
01:26:28,654 --> 01:26:31,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we're gonna overwhelm
this canyon with air support.</font>

1330
01:26:31,059 --> 01:26:32,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've already sent
Diller downrange.</font>

1331
01:26:32,926 --> 01:26:35,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's gonna cut off any
resupply and hit any retreat.</font>

1332
01:26:35,764 --> 01:26:37,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then, you and I are gonna
charge through this Gap</font>

1333
01:26:37,797 --> 01:26:40,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">and hit that main body
with a full frontal assault.</font>

1334
01:26:41,734 --> 01:26:44,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">But Atta cannot
get to Mazar first.</font>

1335
01:26:46,474 --> 01:26:48,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm taking my men through there,
General, with or without you.</font>

1336
01:26:48,943 --> 01:26:51,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">Without me and my men,
you are just an army of 12.</font>

1337
01:26:51,779 --> 01:26:53,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">You all will die.
Good luck.</font>

1338
01:26:53,948 --> 01:26:56,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">God damn it!
You're unbelievable.</font>

1339
01:26:57,917 --> 01:27:01,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">You showed me the town
where your family died.</font>

1340
01:27:01,287 --> 01:27:02,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">Told me every hell Razzan</font>

1341
01:27:02,989 --> 01:27:05,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">and his army unleashed
on this place.</font>

1342
01:27:05,126 --> 01:27:08,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now all you care about
is some turf war?</font>

1343
01:27:08,429 --> 01:27:11,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">You lectured me
about the heart of a warrior.</font>

1344
01:27:11,899 --> 01:27:14,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're no warrior.
You're just another warlord.</font>

1345
01:27:15,667 --> 01:27:17,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, go ahead.</font>

1346
01:27:17,372 --> 01:27:19,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">It ain't us that's quitting,
General, it's you.</font>

1347
01:27:33,354 --> 01:27:35,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not a happy face.</font>

1348
01:27:35,890 --> 01:27:38,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think
Dostum's on board.</font>

1349
01:27:40,094 --> 01:27:42,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you mean not on board?</font>

1350
01:27:42,462 --> 01:27:45,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">He says he's not gonna fight a battle that
opens a way for his rival to take the city.</font>

1351
01:27:45,364 --> 01:27:46,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not
very big-picture of him.</font>

1352
01:27:46,966 --> 01:27:49,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's fighting more than
one war here.</font>

1353
01:27:49,569 --> 01:27:52,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I don't like it, but these
are the cards we've been dealt.</font>

1354
01:27:52,171 --> 01:27:54,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well, Captain,
you gotta talk to him.</font>

1355
01:27:54,375 --> 01:27:56,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did. He's gone.</font>

1356
01:27:56,542 --> 01:27:59,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's taken most of his men, most
of the militia, and they left.</font>

1357
01:28:02,216 --> 01:28:05,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, I ain't gonna lie
to you guys.</font>

1358
01:28:05,019 --> 01:28:08,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">The chances are we are not
gonna make it out of this one.</font>

1359
01:28:11,492 --> 01:28:14,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goddamn, we're this close.</font>

1360
01:28:14,261 --> 01:28:18,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're so close to wiping
Al-Qaeda out of Afghanistan.</font>

1361
01:28:18,064 --> 01:28:21,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll never get
another chance like this.</font>

1362
01:28:21,402 --> 01:28:23,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if we quit now,</font>

1363
01:28:23,770 --> 01:28:25,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">then what happened back home</font>

1364
01:28:25,738 --> 01:28:28,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">is gonna happen
again and again.</font>

1365
01:28:30,978 --> 01:28:33,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Each of you gotta
make this decision,</font>

1366
01:28:33,845 --> 01:28:35,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I'm in.</font>

1367
01:28:37,385 --> 01:28:39,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're ready for anything.</font>

1368
01:28:39,587 --> 01:28:41,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">With or without him.</font>

1369
01:28:42,354 --> 01:28:44,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck him.</font>

1370
01:28:44,457 --> 01:28:46,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean,
we're already here, right?</font>

1371
01:28:46,728 --> 01:28:49,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.
We go in the morning.</font>

1372
01:28:49,529 --> 01:28:51,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">You take what's left
of the guards with you.</font>

1373
01:28:51,631 --> 01:28:53,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">And get some rest tonight.</font>

1374
01:28:53,332 --> 01:28:58,670
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Tomorrow's gonna decide it
one way or another.</i></font>

1375
01:28:58,671 --> 01:29:03,010
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Spencer, Black. You call in
airstrikes from the eastern flank.</i></font>

1376
01:29:05,377 --> 01:29:07,445
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Milo, Jackson and
Essex have been pushed out</i></font>

01:29:07,448 --> 01:29:10,981

down the rabbit hole.</font>

1384
01:29:33,172 --> 01:29:34,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">- All right, Vern.
- Yeah.</font>

1385
01:29:34,875 --> 01:29:36,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who wins in a fight?</font>

1386
01:29:36,778 --> 01:29:39,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">Queen Elizabeth
or Margaret Thatcher?</font>

1387
01:29:39,313 --> 01:29:41,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus, Falls. Where do you
come up with this shit?</font>

1388
01:29:41,448 --> 01:29:43,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">From the depths
of my brilliant mind.</font>

1389
01:29:46,787 --> 01:29:48,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seeing that, boss?</font>

1390
01:29:52,827 --> 01:29:54,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Falls, a scout just
picked us up.</font>
