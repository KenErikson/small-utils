<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you paying attention?</font>

2
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:43,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good.</font>

3
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:48,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you're not listening carefully
you will miss things.</font>

4
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:51,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">Important things.</font>

5
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will not pause,
I will not repeat myself</font>

6
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:57,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you will not interrupt me.</font>

7
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you think that
because you're sitting where you are</font>

8
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:04,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I am sitting where I am</font>

9
00:02:04,373 --> 00:02:08,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">that you are in control
of what is about to happen,</font>

10
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:11,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're mistaken.</font>

11
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am in control,</font>

12
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:16,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">because I know things
that you do not know.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Manchester Police Department.
Please hold.</font>

14
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like a break-in.</font>

15
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">Residence of Turing, Alan.</font>

16
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:29,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Window's broken.
Home's been ransacked.</font>

17
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:31,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">Send a detective down, will you?</font>

18
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:33,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">What I will need from you now</font>

19
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:36,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">is a commitment.</font>

20
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:40,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will listen closely and you will not
judge me until I am finished.</font>

21
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:44,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you cannot commit to this,
then please leave the room.</font>

22
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:47,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come in.</font>

23
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:50,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if you choose to stay,
remember, you chose to be here.</font>

24
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:54,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happens from this moment
forward is not my responsibility.</font>

25
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:56,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's yours.</font>

26
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:01,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pay attention.</font>

27
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:16,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's all this, then?</font>

28
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:19,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Turing, Alan. Professor at King's.</font>

29
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:22,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Seems to have been a burglary.
- Oh? What of?</font>

30
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:24,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's just it.
Nothing missing, really.</font>

31
00:03:26,163 --> 00:03:27,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's he doing in Manchester?</font>

32
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:31,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something with machines.</font>

33
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">The project at the NPL.</font>

34
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:43,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">I checked but he won't
say what it's on.</font>

35
00:03:45,474 --> 00:03:46,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Turing?</font>

36
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:49,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">Detective Nock,
Manchester Police.</font>

37
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:56,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sergeant Staehl here tells me
you had a burglary last night.</font>

38
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:58,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Turing?</font>

39
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:02,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take a step back
and don't breathe heavily.</font>

40
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:05,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Breathe?
- Undiluted cyanide.</font>

41
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:08,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">It wouldn't take more
than a thimbleful to kill you.</font>

42
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:10,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah.</font>

43
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Disappointing.
- Pardon?</font>

44
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:17,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had hoped for a bit more.</font>

45
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:21,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sergeant Staehl, is it just me or do you
get the sense that we're being insulted?</font>

46
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Last night you had a break-in.</font>

47
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your neighbour Mr. Springborn
called to report the noise.</font>

48
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said there was
quite a ruckus.</font>

49
00:04:27,975 --> 00:04:30,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only you say nothing was taken.
It's odd.</font>

50
00:04:30,646 --> 00:04:33,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">So how about you tell us what happened
and we'll find the chap who did this.</font>

51
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gentlemen,</font>

52
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:38,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't believe that you could find
the chap that did this</font>

53
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:41,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">if he walked up to you
and spat in your face.</font>

54
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:45,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">What I could use right now is not
a bobby but a really good cleaning lady.</font>

55
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:48,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">So unless one of you has an apron
in your car,</font>

56
00:04:48,829 --> 00:04:52,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">I suggest you file your reports
and leave me alone.</font>

57
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">As you say, Professor Turing.</font>

58
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Best of luck with your cyanide.</font>

59
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll give you a quid if you
can name me a more insufferable sod.</font>

60
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:07,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seemed a bit forced,
though, didn't it?</font>

61
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't know what you mean.</font>

62
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, if you didn't
want a pair of bobbies</font>

63
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:12,504
<font color="#FFFFFF">digging around in your
personal affairs,</font>

64
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:15,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">that'd have been a stellar way
to make sure they don't.</font>

65
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:18,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me you don't think
this is suspicious.</font>

66
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think this is suspicious.</font>

67
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:21,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">A mysterious professor
who won't admit</font>

68
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:23,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">he's had something stolen
from his house?</font>

69
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:28,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think Alan Turing's
hiding something.</font>

70
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:41,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">War declared!
800,000 children evacuated!</font>

71
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">German bombs on their way!</font>

72
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:44,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get your papers here.</font>

73
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:46,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fresh off the press.</font>

74
00:05:46,178 --> 00:05:47,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">War declared!</font>

75
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">800,000 children evacuated!</font>

76
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">German bombs expected soon!</font>

77
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:53,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get your papers here.</font>

78
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:54,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fresh off the press.</font>

79
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:21,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">This morning,
the British Ambassador in Berlin</font>

80
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:25,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">handed the German government
a final note,</font>

81
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:28,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">stating that unless
we heard from them</font>

82
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:30,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">by 11 o'clock,</font>

83
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:33,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">a state of war would
exist between us.</font>

84
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to tell you now</font>

85
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">that no such undertaking</font>

86
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">has been received.</font>

87
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:41,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that consequently,</font>

88
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:45,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">this country is at
war with Germany.</font>

89
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:13,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">For the second time</font>

90
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:16,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the lives of most of us,</font>

91
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:19,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">we are at war.</font>

92
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:23,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have tried to find</font>

93
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:25,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">a peaceful way out...</font>

94
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">Papers, please.</font>

95
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:10,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What are you doing here?
- Uh, the lady told me to wait.</font>

96
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:12,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">In my office?</font>

97
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:16,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did she tell you to help yourself to tea
while you were here?</font>

98
00:08:16,745 --> 00:08:18,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh... No, she didn't.</font>

99
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">She obviously didn't tell you
what a joke was then, either, I gather?</font>

100
00:08:22,334 --> 00:08:23,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was she supposed to?</font>

101
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:28,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who are you?
- Alan Turing.</font>

102
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:33,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ah, Turing. The mathematician.
- Correct.</font>

103
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">However could I have guessed?</font>

104
00:08:35,347 --> 00:08:37,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">You didn't.
You just read it on that piece of paper.</font>

105
00:08:39,476 --> 00:08:41,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">King's College, Cambridge.</font>

106
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:44,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now it says here you were a bit
of a prodigy in the Maths Department.</font>

107
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:47,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not sure I can
evaluate that, Mr...</font>

108
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,553
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How old are you, Mr. Turing?
- Uh, 27.</font>

109
00:08:49,653 --> 00:08:52,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">And how old were you when you
became a fellow at Cambridge?</font>

110
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">Twenty-four.</font>

111
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">And how old were you
when you published this paper</font>

112
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:57,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">that has a title
that I can barely understand?</font>

113
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, 23.</font>

114
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:02,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you don't think that qualifies you
as a certified prodigy?</font>

115
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:05,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, Newton discovered Binomial Theorem
aged 22.</font>

116
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:09,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">Einstein wrote four papers that changed
the world by the age of 26.</font>

117
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:12,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">As far as I can tell, I've...
I've barely made par.</font>

118
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">- My God, you're serious.
- Would you prefer I made a joke?</font>

119
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:18,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I don't think you know
what those are.</font>

120
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hardly seems fair
that that's a requirement</font>

121
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:21,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">for employment here, Mr...</font>

122
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">Commander Denniston, Royal Navy.</font>

123
00:09:23,395 --> 00:09:24,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, Mr. Turing, I'll bite.</font>

124
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:27,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you wish to work
for His Majesty's Government?</font>

125
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I don't, really.</font>

126
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you a bleeding pacifist?</font>

127
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:35,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm agnostic about violence.</font>

128
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,227
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you do realise that 600 miles
away from London</font>

129
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:40,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">there's this nasty little chap
called Hitler</font>

130
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">who wants to engulf
Europe in tyranny?</font>

131
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:45,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Politics isn't really my area
of expertise.</font>

132
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:46,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really?</font>

133
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I believe
you've just set the record</font>

134
00:09:48,587 --> 00:09:51,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">for the shortest job interview
in British military history.</font>

135
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:52,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, uh...</font>

136
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mother says I can be
off-putting sometimes</font>

137
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">on account of being one of the best
mathematicians in the world.</font>

138
00:09:57,429 --> 00:09:59,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">- In the world?
- Oh, yes.</font>

139
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know how many people
I've rejected for this programme?</font>

140
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,004
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- That's right.</font>

141
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because we're a top
secret programme.</font>

142
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:09,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I'll tell you,
just because we're friends,</font>

143
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:13,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">that only last week I rejected
one of our great nation's top linguists.</font>

144
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:15,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">Knows German better
than Bertolt Brecht.</font>

145
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:18,008
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I don't speak German.
- What?</font>

146
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:22,022
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't speak German.</font>

147
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:25,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, how the hell are you supposed
to decrypt German communications</font>

148
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you don't...
I don't know, speak German?</font>

149
00:10:27,751 --> 00:10:29,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I'm really quite excellent

00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:31,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Margaret!</font>

151
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">German codes are a puzzle.
A game just like any other game.</font>

152
00:10:35,592 --> 00:10:37,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Margaret, where are you?
- I'm really very good at games,</font>

153
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">uh, puzzles.</font>

154
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">And this is the most difficult puzzle
in the world.</font>

155
00:10:40,889 --> 00:10:42,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Margaret!</font>

156
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">For the love of God.</font>

157
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:45,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a joke, obviously.</font>

158
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:50,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm afraid I don't know what those are,
Commander Denniston.</font>

159
00:10:50,899 --> 00:10:52,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have a pleasant trip back
to Cambridge, Professor.</font>

160
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enigma.</font>

161
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:55,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">You called for me?</font>

162
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:08,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what you're doing here.
The top secret programme at Bletchley.</font>

163
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:11,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're trying to break
the German Enigma machine.</font>

164
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:14,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">What makes you think that?</font>

165
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the greatest encryption device
in history</font>

166
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:20,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the Germans use it
for all major communications.</font>

167
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">If the Allies broke Enigma, well,</font>

168
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">this would turn into
a very short war indeed.</font>

169
00:11:28,645 --> 00:11:31,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course that's what
you're working on.</font>

170
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:32,754
<font color="#FFFFFF">You also haven't got
anywhere with it.</font>

171
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:35,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you had, you wouldn't be hiring
cryptographers out of university.</font>

172
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need me a lot
more than I need you.</font>

173
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:41,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">I... I like solving
problems, Commander.</font>

174
00:11:42,826 --> 00:11:46,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Enigma is the most difficult
problem in the world.</font>

175
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:48,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Enigma isn't difficult.
It's impossible.</font>

176
00:11:48,957 --> 00:11:51,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Americans, the
Russians, the French,</font>

177
00:11:51,543 --> 00:11:54,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">the Germans.
Everyone thinks Enigma is unbreakable.</font>

178
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:58,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good. Let me try,
then we'll know for sure, won't we?</font>

179
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:03,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome to Enigma.</font>

180
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:11,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">The details of every surprise attack,
every secret convoy,</font>

181
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:15,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">and every U-boat in the bloody Atlantic
go into that thing</font>

182
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:18,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">and out comes gibberish.</font>

183
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's beautiful.</font>

184
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:25,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the crooked hand of death itself.</font>

185
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:29,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our Wrens intercept thousands
of radio messages a day.</font>

186
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">And to the lovely young ladies
of the Women's Royal Navy,</font>

187
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:34,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">they're nonsense.</font>

188
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:38,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's only when you feed them back
into Enigma that they make any sense.</font>

189
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we have an Enigma machine.</font>

190
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:42,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, Polish Intelligence
smuggled it out of Berlin.</font>

191
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what's the problem?</font>

192
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:46,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just put the intercepted messages
back into the Enigma and...</font>

193
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:49,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, it's not that simple.
Is it?</font>

194
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:53,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just having an Enigma machine
doesn't help you to decode the messages.</font>

195
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:56,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very good, Mr. Turing.</font>

196
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:59,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">To decode a message, you need
to know the machine's settings.</font>

197
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:04,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, the Germans switch settings
every day, promptly at midnight.</font>

198
00:13:04,741 --> 00:13:08,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">We usually intercept our first message
around 6:00am.</font>

199
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:13,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which gives you exactly
18 hours every day to crack the code</font>

200
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">before it changes and
you start again.</font>

201
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">Five rotors. 10
plugboard cables.</font>

202
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:22,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's one million...
- 1,000 million.</font>

203
00:13:22,217 --> 00:13:23,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, it's... I've got it.
- It's a million million.</font>

204
00:13:23,927 --> 00:13:25,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it's in the millions, obviously.</font>

205
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:28,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's over 150 million million million
possible settings.</font>

206
00:13:28,765 --> 00:13:30,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very good.</font>

207
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">One hundred and fifty-nine,
if you want to be exact about it,</font>

208
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">1-5-9 with 18 zeros behind it.</font>

209
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Possibilities.</font>

210
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every single day.</font>

211
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gentlemen, meet Hugh Alexander.</font>

212
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:46,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">I personally selected him
to run this unit.</font>

213
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:47,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">Didn't you...</font>

214
00:13:48,076 --> 00:13:50,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Alexander won Britain's
national chess championship.</font>

215
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Twice.
- You're not the only one</font>

216
00:13:53,081 --> 00:13:55,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">who's good at games
round here, Turing.</font>

217
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:59,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are we to work together, then?
I prefer to have my own office.</font>

218
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:00,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a team and you
will work as one.</font>

219
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:04,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't have time to explain myself
as I go along</font>

220
00:14:04,259 --> 00:14:06,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'm afraid these men
would only slow me down.</font>

221
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:08,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you can't play together,</font>

222
00:14:09,097 --> 00:14:11,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">then I'm afraid
we can't let you play at all.</font>

223
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:13,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is Stewart Menzies. MI6.</font>

224
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:15,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are only five divisions
of Military Intelligence.</font>

225
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">- There is no MI6.
- Exactly.</font>

226
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:20,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the spirit.</font>

227
00:14:21,693 --> 00:14:24,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Turing, do you know
how many British servicemen have died</font>

228
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:25,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">because of Enigma?</font>

229
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:28,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Uh, no, I don't.
- Three.</font>

230
00:14:29,284 --> 00:14:31,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">While we've been having
this conversation.</font>

231
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, look, there's another.</font>

232
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">I rather hope he
didn't have a family.</font>

233
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:41,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">This war Commander Denniston's
been going on about,</font>

234
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:43,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">we're not winning it.</font>

235
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Break the code,
at least we have a chance.</font>

236
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:52,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shall we leave the children alone
with their new toy?</font>

237
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, gentlemen...</font>

238
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">let's play.</font>

239
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:10,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">The game was quite a simple one.</font>

240
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:14,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every single German message,</font>

241
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:17,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">every surprise attack,
every bombing run,</font>

242
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:18,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">every, uh...</font>

243
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">imminent U-boat assault.</font>

244
00:15:26,341 --> 00:15:28,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">They were all floating through the air.</font>

245
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">Radio signals that,</font>

246
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">well, any schoolboy
with an AM kit could intercept.</font>

247
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">The trick was that
they were encrypted.</font>

248
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:03,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">One hundred and fifty-nine
million million million</font>

249
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">possible Enigma settings.</font>

250
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:09,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">All we had to do
was try each one.</font>

251
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:15,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if we had 10 men
checking one setting a minute</font>

252
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:19,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">for 24 hours every day
and seven days every week,</font>

253
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:26,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">how many days do you think it would take
to check each of the settings?</font>

254
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not days, it's years.</font>

255
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:36,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's 20 million years.</font>

256
00:16:38,246 --> 00:16:39,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">To stop a coming attack,</font>

257
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:44,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">we would have to check
20 million years' worth of settings</font>

258
00:16:44,961 --> 00:16:46,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">in 20 minutes.</font>

259
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:16,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm famished. Lunch?</font>

260
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:20,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good Lord, what is it about women
with little hats?</font>

261
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:30,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">The boys...
We're going to get some lunch.</font>

262
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:36,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alan?</font>

263
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:38,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes?
- I said we're going to get some lunch.</font>

264
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Alan?
- Yes?</font>

265
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:46,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Can you hear me?
- Yes.</font>

266
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">I said we're off to get some...</font>

267
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:51,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is starting to get
a little bit repetitive.</font>

268
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is?</font>

269
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had asked if you wanted
to come to lunch with us.</font>

270
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:56,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">Er, no, you didn't.</font>

271
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said you were going
to get some lunch.</font>

272
00:17:59,077 --> 00:18:00,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have I offended you in some way?</font>

273
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:02,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would you think that?</font>

274
00:18:02,914 --> 00:18:04,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you like to come
to lunch with us?</font>

275
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">What time's lunchtime?</font>

276
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:08,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Christ, Alan, it's a bleeding sandwich.
- What is?</font>

277
00:18:09,087 --> 00:18:11,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Lunch.
- I don't like sandwiches.</font>

278
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never mind.</font>

279
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:17,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, to pull off
this irascible genius routine,</font>

280
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,749
<font color="#FFFFFF">one actually has to
be a genius, Alan.</font>

281
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:22,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">And yet we're the ones
making progress here, aren't we?</font>

282
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are?</font>

283
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, we are.</font>

284
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:29,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have decrypted a number
of German messages</font>

285
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">by analysing the frequency
of letter distribution.</font>

286
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:35,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, even a broken clock is right
twice a day.</font>

287
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not progress.
That's just blind luck.</font>

288
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:41,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm designing a machine that will
allow us to break every message,</font>

289
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:44,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">every day, instantly.</font>

290
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:47,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's hungry?</font>

291
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:51,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let's go.
- I'm hungry.</font>

292
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:56,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- Peter asked who was hungry.</font>

293
00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:57,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I have some soup, please?</font>

294
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:27,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you mean, classified?</font>

295
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:30,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I am aware of the literal meaning
of the word "classified",</font>

296
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:32,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">what I'm asking is
why would a maths professor</font>

297
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">have his military
records classified?</font>

298
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well, I will come down.</font>

299
00:20:59,342 --> 00:21:01,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pardon me, I'd like to see
some documents, if I may.</font>

300
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:05,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">Service records of a
Mr... Turing, Alan.</font>

301
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">Foreign Office sent me.</font>

302
00:21:14,522 --> 00:21:16,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is unacceptable.</font>

303
00:21:17,108 --> 00:21:18,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you wish to discuss a complaint,</font>

304
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:20,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">I suggest you make a
proper appointment.</font>

305
00:21:20,403 --> 00:21:22,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alexander... Complaint?</font>

306
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:27,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No, Hugh Alexander has denied
my requisition for parts and equipment</font>

307
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:28,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">that I need to build the machine
I have designed.</font>

308
00:21:28,703 --> 00:21:31,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your fellow code-breakers
are refusing to work with you</font>

309
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:32,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">and they've filed a
formal complaint.</font>

310
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is inspired
by an old Polish code machine,</font>

311
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">only this one is
infinitely more advanced.</font>

312
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:38,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you don't respond
to the complaint,</font>

313
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">I shall have to take it up
with the Home Office.</font>

314
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:42,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put those files by my desk.</font>

315
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:43,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine. My response is
they're all idiots,</font>

316
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:45,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">fire them and use the savings
to fund my machine.</font>

317
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:48,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">I only need about £100,000.</font>

318
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:51,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">£100,000?</font>

319
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:54,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you building a machine?</font>

320
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's highly technical,
you wouldn't understand.</font>

321
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:00,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">I suggest you make
the effort to try.</font>

322
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:05,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enigma is an extremely
well-designed machine.</font>

323
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:09,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our problem is that
we're only using men to try to beat it.</font>

324
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:12,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if only a machine
can defeat another machine?</font>

325
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's not very technical.</font>

326
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hugh Alexander
is in charge of your unit.</font>

327
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:19,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said no and that is that.</font>

328
00:22:19,462 --> 00:22:21,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">I simply don't have time for this.</font>

329
00:22:21,589 --> 00:22:23,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you ever won a war, Turing?</font>

330
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:27,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have. Do you know
how it's done?</font>

331
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Order. Discipline.
Chain of command.</font>

332
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not at
university any longer.</font>

333
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:35,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are a very small cog
in a very large system</font>

334
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:39,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you will do
as your commanding officer instructs.</font>

335
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:45,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who... Who is your
commanding officer?</font>

336
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:50,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">Winston Churchill,
Number 10 Downing Street, London SW1.</font>

337
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:54,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have a problem with my decision,
you can take it up with him.</font>

338
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:03,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Menzies. Mr. Menzies!</font>

339
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:08,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you going to London?</font>

340
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:13,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Possibly.
- Would you deliver a letter for me?</font>

341
00:23:20,191 --> 00:23:22,584
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I'm sorry, but are you joking?</font>

342
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:24,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">Churchill's put Alan in charge?</font>

343
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This is a terrible idea.
- No, no, no...</font>

344
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:29,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I can give these
men orders now?</font>

345
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:31,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hate to say it but yes.</font>

346
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:34,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excellent. Keith and Charles,
you're both fired.</font>

347
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Excuse me?
- What?</font>

348
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:39,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're mediocre linguists
and positively poor code-breakers.</font>

349
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:42,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alan, you can't just fire
Keith and Charles.</font>

350
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:43,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, he just said I could.</font>

351
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:45,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I did no such thing.</font>

352
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:46,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">But Churchill did.</font>

353
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go to hell.</font>

354
00:24:03,526 --> 00:24:06,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, this is inhuman.</font>

355
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:08,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even for you.</font>

356
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,303
<font color="#FFFFFF">Popular at school, were you?</font>

357
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:22,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">The problem began, of course,</font>

358
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">with the carrots.</font>

359
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:26,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">The carrots are orange.</font>

360
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:31,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">The peas are green.
They mustn't touch.</font>

361
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:58,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know why people like violence?</font>

362
00:24:59,582 --> 00:25:02,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is because it feels good.</font>

363
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:06,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">Humans find violence
deeply satisfying.</font>

364
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:11,526
<font color="#FFFFFF">But remove the satisfaction</font>

365
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:15,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the act becomes hollow.</font>

366
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:23,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">Turing?</font>

367
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:26,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

368
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:27,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't be such a kike about it.</font>

369
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:31,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leave him to bloody rot.</font>

370
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:40,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't learn this
on my own, of course.</font>

371
00:25:40,788 --> 00:25:42,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had help.</font>

372
00:25:43,666 --> 00:25:45,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Christopher helped.</font>

373
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:49,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alan, are you all right?</font>

374
00:25:55,511 --> 00:25:59,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not my fault.
The carrots got in with the peas and...</font>

375
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:02,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, I won't let
them do it again.</font>

376
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're getting worse.</font>

377
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:07,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">They only beat me up
because I'm smarter than they are.</font>

378
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, they beat you up
because you're different.</font>

379
00:26:09,817 --> 00:26:12,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mother says I'm just an odd duck.
- And she's right.</font>

380
00:26:13,696 --> 00:26:15,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you know, Alan,</font>

381
00:26:15,531 --> 00:26:18,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">sometimes it's the very people
who no one imagines anything of</font>

382
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">who do the things
no one can imagine.</font>

383
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:29,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what do we do now?</font>

384
00:26:31,382 --> 00:26:35,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We're short on staff.
- Well, we, uh, we get more staff, then.</font>

385
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:38,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">And how do you
propose to do that?</font>

386
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:09,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">Erm, Alan Turing to
see Stewart Menzies.</font>

387
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very good, sir.</font>

388
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">So who are they?</font>

389
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:16,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, all sorts, really.
A teacher. An engineer.</font>

390
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:18,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">A handful of students.</font>

391
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you think
they're qualified for Bletchley</font>

392
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">'cause they're good
at crossword puzzles?</font>

393
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:24,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, they say they're good
and now we shall find out, won't we?</font>

394
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:27,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">In order to aid your efforts,</font>

395
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:30,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">there is, to the right of you,
a green scratch card book.</font>

396
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:33,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are to make notes in that.
Gentlemen, you have six minutes</font>

397
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:36,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">in which to complete the puzzle,
at which point I will...</font>

398
00:29:38,734 --> 00:29:40,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pardon me, ma'am,
this room's restricted.</font>

399
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:43,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, apologies for my tardiness.
The bus caught a flat tyre.</font>

400
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:45,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">May I continue, please?
Thank you.</font>

401
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:49,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're not allowed in here, ma'am.
- Oh, but I'm only a few minutes late...</font>

402
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:52,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">The secretaries are to head upstairs.
This room's for the candidates.</font>

403
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">May I get on with
this now, please?</font>

404
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:58,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Uh, I am a candidate.
- For what position?</font>

405
00:29:58,463 --> 00:29:59,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">The letter didn't say, precisely.</font>

406
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:01,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, the secretaries
are to head upstairs.</font>

407
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:03,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">It did say that it
was top secret.</font>

408
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:05,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is going on?</font>

409
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:08,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">I... I solved a crossword puzzle
in the newspaper</font>

410
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:09,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I got this letter saying</font>

411
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:12,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">that I was a candidate
for some sort of mysterious job.</font>

412
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:13,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">My name's Joan Clarke.</font>

413
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:16,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">Miss, did you really solve
this puzzle yourself?</font>

414
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:21,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">What makes you think
I couldn't solve the puzzle myself?</font>

415
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:22,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm really very good at...</font>

416
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ma'am, I'll have to ask you to...</font>

417
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:29,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">Miss Clarke, I find tardiness
under any circumstance unacceptable.</font>

418
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:36,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take a seat so that
we may continue.</font>

419
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:40,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

420
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:43,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, as I was saying,</font>

421
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:47,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">you have six minutes
to complete the task in front of you.</font>

422
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:50,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Erm, gentlemen, and lady...</font>

423
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">begin.</font>

424
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:22,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Six minutes.</font>

425
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:26,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is that even possible?
- No, no. Takes me eight.</font>

426
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">This isn't about
crossword puzzles.</font>

427
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:31,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's about how one approaches
solving an impossible problem.</font>

428
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:35,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you tackle the whole thing
at once or divide it into small...</font>

429
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've finished?</font>

430
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:40,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

431
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:56,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">Five minutes and 34 seconds.</font>

432
00:31:57,833 --> 00:31:59,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said to do it in under six.</font>

433
00:32:00,876 --> 00:32:02,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">Congratulations.</font>

434
00:32:02,878 --> 00:32:05,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">My warmest welcome
to His Majesty's Service.</font>

435
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:07,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you speak a word
of what I'm about to show you,</font>

436
00:32:07,925 --> 00:32:09,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">you will be executed
for high treason.</font>

437
00:32:11,221 --> 00:32:13,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will lie to your friends,
your family</font>

438
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:16,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">and everyone you meet
about what it is you really do.</font>

439
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what is it that
we're really doing?</font>

440
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:24,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're going to break an unbreakable
Nazi code and win the war.</font>

441
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:27,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

442

<font color="#FFFFFF">What's that you're reading?</font>

443
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:42,852
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's about cryptography.
- Like secret messages?</font>

444
00:32:44,211 --> 00:32:47,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not secret.
That's the brilliant part.</font>

445
00:32:47,923 --> 00:32:50,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">Messages that anyone can see
but no one knows what they mean</font>

446
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:52,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">unless you have the key.</font>

447
00:32:58,268 --> 00:33:00,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">How's that different
from talking?</font>

448
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Talking?
- When people talk to each other,</font>

449
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:06,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">they never say what they mean,
they say something else.</font>

450
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:09,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you're expected
to just know what they mean.</font>

451
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:10,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only I never do.</font>

452
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:12,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">So...</font>

453
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:14,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">how's that different?</font>

454
00:33:16,243 --> 00:33:19,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alan, I have a funny feeling
you're going to be very good at this.</font>

455
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goodnight, Alan.</font>

456
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goodnight.</font>

457
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">Careful, will you? It's not a toy.</font>

458
00:34:15,846 --> 00:34:17,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Funny. Looks like a toy.</font>

459
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:22,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bloody great £100,000 one.
Your new minion's arrived.</font>

- Well, where's Miss Clarke?</font>

461
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lovely, isn't he?</font>

462
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:35,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not just a usual
humdrum production mill factory.</font>

463
00:34:35,489 --> 00:34:40,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, well, as I was saying,
it's a very important radio factory.</font>

464
00:34:40,454 --> 00:34:42,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not, actually.</font>

465

factories, this one is particularly...</font>

466
00:34:58,512 --> 00:35:01,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you not at Bletchley?</font>

467
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:03,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you so much for your visit,
Mr. Turing.</font>

468
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:06,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Was your trip pleasant?
- Gather your things and let's go.</font>

469
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:09,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry but I'm unable
to accept your offer.</font>

470
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:13,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">We feel that such a position
would hardly be appropriate.</font>

471
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:15,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">You earned a double first
in mathematics.</font>

472
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:18,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">But sadly, wasn't granted
the opportunity to become a fellow.</font>

473
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:20,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">You belong at Bletchley.</font>

474
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:24,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, but for someone
in my position to live, to...</font>

475
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:28,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">to work in a radio factory
so far from home,</font>

476
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:32,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">with all your men,
erm, it would be...</font>

477
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:35,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">indecorous.</font>

478
00:35:36,802 --> 00:35:39,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">What in the world
does that even mean?</font>

479
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:48,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have a group of young ladies
who tend to all of our clerical tasks.</font>

480
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:50,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Assistants, translators.</font>

481
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">They live, erm,
together in town.</font>

482
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:57,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would that be a
more suitable environment?</font>

483
00:35:57,697 --> 00:36:01,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm. So... So I would be working
amongst these women?</font>

484
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:03,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

485
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:07,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wonderful ladies.</font>

486
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:11,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">They even organise social events
at St. Martin's church down the road.</font>

487
00:36:11,253 --> 00:36:13,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really, the whole
thing is quite, er,</font>

488
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">um, decorous.</font>

489
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:23,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, you won't have
proper security clearance, of course,</font>

490
00:36:23,889 --> 00:36:26,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">so we'll have to
improvise things a bit.</font>

491
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you helping me?</font>

492
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:31,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because there is only one thing that
matters in this entire world right now,</font>

493
00:36:31,565 --> 00:36:33,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">do you understand?
And that is breaking Enigma.</font>

494
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:35,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">But... But Mr. Turing...</font>

495
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:39,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you helping me?</font>

496
00:36:39,905 --> 00:36:41,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, um...</font>

497
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:46,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes it's the very people
who no one imagines anything of</font>

498
00:36:46,161 --> 00:36:49,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">who do the things
that no one can imagine.</font>

499
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:09,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir.</font>

500
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:13,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What this?
- Alan Turing's classified military file.</font>

501
00:37:15,025 --> 00:37:16,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Bloody empty.
- Exactly.</font>

502
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:19,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's an empty manila envelope.
- Yeah.</font>

503
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:23,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've cracked the case wide open, then,
haven't you?</font>

504
00:37:23,365 --> 00:37:25,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alan Turing's war records
aren't just classified,</font>

505
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:27,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">they're non-existent.</font>

506
00:37:28,038 --> 00:37:31,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">That means someone's got rid of them,
erased them, burnt them.</font>

507
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:35,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that same person broke
into his house and stole nothing?</font>

508
00:37:36,503 --> 00:37:38,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean.</font>

509
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What, the spies from the papers?
- Soviet spies.</font>

510
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">But first they were professors,
weren't they?</font>

511
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:48,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Radicalised at Cambridge,
then they joined the Communist Party,</font>

512
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:49,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">then the Foreign Office,</font>

513
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:51,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">then leaked information to Stalin
during the war.</font>

514
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:54,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, can you think of anyone else
we know who was at Cambridge,</font>

515
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:57,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">then took up something murky
and top secret when the war broke out?</font>

516
00:37:58,275 --> 00:38:01,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think this Alan Turing
might be a Soviet agent?</font>

517
00:38:01,987 --> 00:38:06,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think something very serious
is happening right here under our noses.</font>

518
00:38:07,409 --> 00:38:10,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wouldn't you like
to find out what it is?</font>

519
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:45,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome, ladies.
If you'd like to follow me.</font>

520
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:50,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some people thought
we were at war with the Germans.</font>

521
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:51,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">Incorrect.</font>

522
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:53,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were at war with the clock.</font>

523
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:55,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">Britain was literally
starving to death.</font>

524
00:38:56,751 --> 00:39:01,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Americans sent over 100,000 tonnes
of food every week</font>

525
00:39:01,463 --> 00:39:04,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">and every week the Germans would
send our desperately needed bread</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">to the bottom of the ocean.</font>

527
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:10,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our daily failure was announced
at the chimes of midnight.</font>

528
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:13,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the sound would haunt
our unwelcome dreams.</font>

529
00:39:14,476 --> 00:39:16,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tick, tock.</font>

530
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:18,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tick.</font>

531
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:26,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn it!</font>

532
00:39:28,365 --> 00:39:30,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What just happened?
- Midnight.</font>

533
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:33,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">All the work we've done today
is useless.</font>

534
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, but don't worry,
we've a few hours</font>

535
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:37,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">before tomorrow's messages
start flooding in,</font>

536
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:40,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">then we start all over again.</font>

537
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">- From scratch.
- I'm so sick of this.</font>

00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:56,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">If this job wasn't already impossible
before, it bloody well is now.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Hugh, don't.</font>

543
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:08,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn you and your
useless machine.</font>

this bloody machine?</font>

548
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:21,860

<font color="#FFFFFF">- Stop!
- You arrogant bastard.</font>

550
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:25,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">You could help us.</font>

551
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:28,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">You could make this go faster
but you won't.</font>

552
00:40:30,385 --> 00:40:31,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get off.</font>

553
00:40:37,559 --> 00:40:39,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's right, Alan.</font>

554
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:45,041

561
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:11,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, Peter.</font>

562
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:53,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">It wasn't just programmable,
it was re-programmable?</font>

589
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:14,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm.</font>

590
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:16,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that your idea
behind Christopher?</font>

591
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:22,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">Human brains can compute large sums
very quickly, even Hugh can do that,</font>

592
00:44:22,284 --> 00:44:24,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I want Christopher
to be smarter.</font>

593
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:29,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">To make a calculation
and then to determine what to do next.</font>

594
00:44:30,043 --> 00:44:31,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like a person does.</font>

595
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:34,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Think of it.</font>

596
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:35,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">An electrical brain.</font>

597
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">A digital computer.</font>

598
00:44:39,052 --> 00:44:40,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">Digital computer?</font>

599
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:43,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

600
00:44:57,402 --> 00:44:58,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's going on?</font>

601
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:00,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's happening?</font>

602
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:03,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, no, no. Don't touch that.
- Stay back.</font>

603
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:05,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's my desk.</font>

604
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:09,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank goodness. I'd hate to think
we were searching the wrong one.</font>

605
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:10,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?
What's going on?</font>

606
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:14,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is a spy in
Bletchley Park.</font>

607
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:16,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Navy thinks that one of us
is a Soviet double agent, Alan.</font>

608
00:45:17,422 --> 00:45:18,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

609
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:22,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our boys intercepted this
on its way to Moscow.</font>

610
00:45:22,762 --> 00:45:24,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look familiar?</font>

611
00:45:28,226 --> 00:45:29,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a Beale cipher.</font>

612
00:45:29,726 --> 00:45:32,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">Encrypted with a phrase from a book
or a poem or...</font>

613
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:40,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">You...</font>

614
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:43,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't seriously think I did this,
do you?</font>

615
00:45:44,659 --> 00:45:46,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Double agents are such bastards.</font>

616
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:51,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">Isolated loners.
No attachments to friends or family.</font>

617
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:52,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Arrogant.</font>

618
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:54,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">Know anybody like that?</font>

619
00:45:58,297 --> 00:45:59,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">I...</font>

620
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:02,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm. I know you don't like me</font>

621
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:05,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">but that does not
make me a Soviet spy.</font>

622
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:08,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing out of the
ordinary, sir.</font>

623
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really? Hmm, all right.</font>

624
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Home Office
may be protecting you now</font>

625
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:19,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">but sooner or later,
you will make a mistake.</font>

626
00:46:21,237 --> 00:46:23,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I needn't bother firing you.</font>

627
00:46:23,405 --> 00:46:25,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">They will hang you for treason.</font>

628
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:48,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello.</font>

629
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:51,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard about what happened.</font>

630
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:54,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all the girls in Hut 3
can talk about.</font>

631
00:46:56,771 --> 00:46:59,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have an idea of what
might cheer you up.</font>

632
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:05,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, because no letter can be
encoded as itself,</font>

633
00:47:05,697 --> 00:47:08,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">there's already a handful of settings
that can be rejected at the outset.</font>

634
00:47:13,706 --> 00:47:15,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is that your team?
- Uh, yes.</font>

635
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:17,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Shall we say hello?
- No.</font>

636
00:47:17,418 --> 00:47:18,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello.</font>

637
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:21,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you not to do that.</font>

638
00:47:22,632 --> 00:47:24,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alan.</font>

639
00:47:24,175 --> 00:47:26,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Uh, Hugh, hello.
- Didn't know you drank.</font>

640
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:28,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">He doesn't, really.
He just sort of sips at the foam.</font>

641
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:30,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll let you
into a little secret, Miss...</font>

642
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:32,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Clarke.
- Miss Clarke.</font>

643
00:47:32,432 --> 00:47:34,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Please.
- Foam's my favourite part, too.</font>

644
00:47:35,268 --> 00:47:37,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is it really?
- Come and join us for a drink.</font>

645
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:40,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We'll be there in a moment.
- Miss Clarke.</font>

646
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:48,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, he likes you.</font>

647
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:50,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes.
- You, uh...</font>

648
00:47:51,452 --> 00:47:53,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got him to like you.</font>

649
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:56,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes.
- Why?</font>

650
00:47:57,666 --> 00:47:59,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I'm a woman
in a man's job</font>

651
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:01,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I don't have the luxury
of being an arse.</font>

652
00:48:02,922 --> 00:48:05,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alan, it doesn't matter
how smart you are,</font>

653
00:48:06,217 --> 00:48:08,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enigma is always smarter.</font>

654
00:48:09,344 --> 00:48:12,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you really want to
solve your puzzle,</font>

655
00:48:12,181 --> 00:48:14,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">then you're going to need
all the help you can get</font>

656
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:18,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">and they are not going to help you
if they do not like you.</font>

657
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:27,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are those?</font>

658
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Apples.
- No.</font>

659
00:48:29,864 --> 00:48:32,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, they really are. Um, I've...</font>

660
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:35,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, Miss Clarke...
Joan, actually, um,</font>

661
00:48:36,289 --> 00:48:37,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">said that it would be nice</font>

662
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:40,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">if I was to bring
you all something.</font>

663
00:48:40,376 --> 00:48:42,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">So here we are.</font>

664
00:48:42,295 --> 00:48:44,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thank you.
- I like apples.</font>

665
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:46,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">My best to Miss Clarke.</font>

666
00:48:46,923 --> 00:48:51,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, there are two people in a wood
and, um, they run into a bear.</font>

667
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:53,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">The first person gets down
on his knees to pray.</font>

668
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:55,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">The second person
starts lacing up his boots.</font>

669
00:48:55,974 --> 00:48:57,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">The first person asks
the second person,</font>

670
00:48:57,893 --> 00:49:01,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">"My dear friend, what are you doing?
You can't outrun a bear."</font>

671
00:49:01,146 --> 00:49:02,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">To which the second
person responds,</font>

672
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:06,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">"I don't have to,
I only have to outrun you."</font>

673
00:49:17,246 --> 00:49:20,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll be with Christopher
if anyone needs me.</font>

674
00:49:20,333 --> 00:49:24,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we assume that the square
root of two is a rational number,</font>

675
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:30,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">then we can say that
the square root of two is A over B,</font>

676
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:34,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">where A and B are whole numbers</font>

677
00:49:34,847 --> 00:49:37,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">and B is not zero.</font>

678
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:40,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mr. Turing, passing notes, are we?
- No, sir.</font>

679
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:50,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only Turing would pass notes
written in gibberish.</font>

680
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:57,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, gentlemen.</font>

681
00:49:57,286 --> 00:50:00,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do not forget your algebra
over the break.</font>

682
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:02,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have a pleasant holiday.</font>

683
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:06,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we'll resume your irrationals
when you return.</font>

684
00:50:38,244 --> 00:50:39,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm.</font>

685
00:50:41,746 --> 00:50:44,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">But Euler's Theorem
gives you that immediately.</font>

686
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:46,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">Erm...</font>

687
00:50:55,677 --> 00:50:57,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here, look at this.</font>

688
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:02,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you run the wires across
the plugboard matrix diagonally,</font>

689
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:05,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">it will eliminate rotor positions
500 times faster.</font>

690
00:51:06,688 --> 00:51:10,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's, uh,
actually not an entirely terrible idea.</font>

691
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:15,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think that was Alan
for "thank you".</font>

692
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:22,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's my sandwich.
- You don't like sandwiches.</font>

693
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:38,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you nervous?</font>

694
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:02,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happens now?</font>

695
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:07,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it should work out
the day's Enigma settings.</font>

696
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:23,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long?</font>

697
00:52:41,826 --> 00:52:44,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">The German Army
has fanned out across Europe,</font>

698
00:52:44,869 --> 00:52:48,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">from Poland to Serbia,
Lithuania to Denmark, Norway to France.</font>

699
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:52,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Nazi flag now flies from more
than two dozen national capitals.</font>

700
00:52:53,045 --> 00:52:57,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">Their campaign mounts in fury
as a free Europe crumbles.</font>

701
00:53:38,007 --> 00:53:39,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it's still going.</font>

702
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:42,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Good morning, sir.
- Morning, Margaret.</font>

703
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:45,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gears keep spinning on and on.
Rotors on and on.</font>

704
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:47,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's endless.</font>

705
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:51,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">- With no result in sight?
- No.</font>

706
00:54:05,326 --> 00:54:06,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Turing.</font>

707
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:20,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">Turing, open the bloody door.</font>

708
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:22,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No.</font>

709
00:54:24,552 --> 00:54:26,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">Open the door or
we'll break it down.</font>

710
00:54:26,554 --> 00:54:28,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't let you in.</font>

711
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:30,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">I cannot let you interfere.</font>

712
00:54:30,516 --> 00:54:32,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on, then.</font>

713
00:54:39,443 --> 00:54:40,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Turn that thing off!</font>

714
00:54:41,362 --> 00:54:43,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Don't, please.</font>

715
00:54:43,447 --> 00:54:45,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, please, please!</font>

716
00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:48,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No, don't! No, no!</font>

717
00:54:52,206 --> 00:54:56,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, then, it seems that your great
big expensive machine doesn't work.</font>

718
00:54:58,128 --> 00:54:59,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">It does.</font>

719
00:55:00,047 --> 00:55:03,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wonderful.
So you've broken Enigma, then?</font>

720
00:55:03,884 --> 00:55:05,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was just...</font>

721
00:55:06,302 --> 00:55:08,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Still working.</font>

722
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:11,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is my associate
from the Home Office.</font>

723
00:55:12,101 --> 00:55:15,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see,
£100,000 is rather a lot of money</font>

724
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:17,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he's here to see
what you have to show for it.</font>

725
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:21,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will never understand</font>

726
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:25,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">the importance of what
I am creating here!</font>

727
00:55:26,657 --> 00:55:29,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you decrypted
any German messages?</font>

728
00:55:30,119 --> 00:55:31,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">A single one?</font>

729
00:55:32,788 --> 00:55:35,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you point to anything at all
that you've achieved?</font>

730
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:37,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

731
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:41,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your funding is up
and our patience has expired.</font>

732
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:46,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's with such great pleasure
that I am finally able to say this.</font>

733
00:55:46,635 --> 00:55:48,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alan Turing, you're fired.</font>

734
00:55:50,264 --> 00:55:52,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please escort Mr. Turing
from the premises.</font>

735
00:55:53,976 --> 00:55:55,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

736
00:55:57,103 --> 00:55:58,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">I beg your pardon?</font>

737
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:06,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you fire Alan,</font>

738
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:09,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">well, then, you'll
have to fire me, too.</font>

739
00:56:09,949 --> 00:56:11,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">What on earth are you saying?</font>

740
00:56:12,327 --> 00:56:13,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">Trust me when I tell
you there is no one</font>

741
00:56:14,038 --> 00:56:16,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">who would rather say this
less than I do but...</font>

742
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:21,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">he's right. Alan is right.</font>

743
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:25,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">His machine can work and it's probably
the best chance that we've got.</font>

744
00:56:26,467 --> 00:56:28,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">God, it's beyond belief.</font>

745
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:32,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you fire them,
you'll have to fire me, too.</font>

746
00:56:32,847 --> 00:56:34,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">And me.</font>

747
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:37,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're the best
cryptographic minds in Britain.</font>

748
00:56:37,978 --> 00:56:39,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you going to fire us all?</font>

749
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:42,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">Commander, at least
give us some more time.</font>

750
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:46,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">Six months. And if the machine doesn't
produce any results that we need,</font>

751
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:49,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">then we'll go back to doing things
the old way. How about that?</font>

752
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:58,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">One month.</font>

753
00:56:58,331 --> 00:57:01,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then so help me God,
you're all gone.</font>

754
00:57:02,335 --> 00:57:03,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, leave him.</font>

755
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:15,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thank you.
- You're welcome.</font>

756
00:57:16,682 --> 00:57:19,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, and, Alan, your machine,</font>

757
00:57:22,106 --> 00:57:23,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">it had better bloody work.</font>

758
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:33,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hugh...</font>

759
00:57:34,076 --> 00:57:35,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">I swear,</font>

760
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:38,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not a spy.</font>

761
00:57:39,914 --> 00:57:42,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, for God's sake,
of course you're not a bloody spy.</font>

762
00:57:42,708 --> 00:57:45,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- Denniston gave me the Beale cipher</font>

763
00:57:45,628 --> 00:57:48,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">and guess what? I cracked it.</font>

764
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:52,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Ask, and it shall be given to you;
seek and ye shall find."</font>

765
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:54,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Matthew 7:7.
That was the key.</font>

766
00:57:55,806 --> 00:57:58,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">Far too simple for
the likes of you.</font>

767
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:01,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pity Denniston disagrees.</font>

768
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:14,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come in.</font>

769
00:58:16,577 --> 00:58:18,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir, I think I've got Turing.</font>

770
00:58:19,788 --> 00:58:23,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">I tailed him to a pub last night where
he met a bloke. Exchanged an envelope.</font>

771
00:58:24,418 --> 00:58:27,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I follow this other fella,
pick him up, gave him a good shake.</font>

772
00:58:29,338 --> 00:58:32,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He's a poofter. He confessed.
- What?</font>

773
00:58:33,594 --> 00:58:35,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">The man admitted it.
Arnold Murray.</font>

774
00:58:36,096 --> 00:58:38,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hangs around that pub,
men pay him for a go.</font>

775
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:41,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">Turing's one of the
men that paid.</font>

776
00:58:41,268 --> 00:58:43,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only Mr. Murray here
then has the bright idea</font>

777
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:45,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">of robbing Turing's house after,
with a friend.</font>

778
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:48,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what Turing's hiding.</font>

779
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:50,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, he's a poof, not a spy.</font>

780
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:52,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- What's the matter?</font>

781
00:58:52,445 --> 00:58:54,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can charge a university professor
with indecency.</font>

782
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:57,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, this is... It's bloody rubbish.
Turing's up to something important.</font>

783
00:58:57,826 --> 00:59:00,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's committed a crime
and he's broken the law.</font>

784
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:01,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">And with a bloke.</font>

785
00:59:01,621 --> 00:59:03,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus Christ, it's
bloody disgusting.</font>

786
00:59:03,331 --> 00:59:05,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">This isn't the investigation
I was conducting.</font>

787
00:59:05,876 --> 00:59:07,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bring him in.</font>

788
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:09,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait.</font>

789
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:13,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me interrogate him. Please.
Give me half an hour alone</font>

790
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:16,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then I swear, I'll spend
the next month running errands</font>

791
00:59:16,135 --> 00:59:18,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">on as many rubbish
cases as you like.</font>

792
00:59:19,139 --> 00:59:20,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine.</font>

793
00:59:20,389 --> 00:59:23,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, will someone get me a warrant
for the arrest of Alan Turing?</font>

794
00:59:39,992 --> 00:59:41,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alan?</font>

795
00:59:41,202 --> 00:59:43,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">Christopher's simply not
moving fast enough.</font>

796
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:46,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We should talk.
- And even with the diagonal board,</font>

797
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">he's still not eliminating settings
as quickly as we need him to...</font>

798
00:59:49,335 --> 00:59:51,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm leaving.
- But you've just walked in.</font>

799
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:55,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No, Bletchley.</font>

800
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:58,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- It's my parents.</font>

801
00:59:58,762 --> 01:00:01,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm 25, I'm unmarried,
I'm living alone and they want me home.</font>

802
01:00:02,224 --> 01:00:04,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's just ridiculous.</font>

803
01:00:04,893 --> 01:00:06,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's my parents.</font>

804
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:09,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">You... You can't leave.
I won't let you.</font>

805
01:00:10,356 --> 01:00:11,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">"I'll miss you."</font>

806
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:14,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what a normal person
might say in this situation.</font>

807
01:00:14,068 --> 01:00:16,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care what is normal.</font>

808
01:00:16,195 --> 01:00:17,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">What am I supposed to do, Alan?</font>

809
01:00:20,032 --> 01:00:23,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">I... I will not
give up my parents.</font>

810
01:00:24,371 --> 01:00:25,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">You...</font>

811
01:00:25,454 --> 01:00:29,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have an opportunity here
to make some actual use of your life.</font>

812
01:00:29,793 --> 01:00:31,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">And end up like you? No, thanks.</font>

813
01:00:33,045 --> 01:00:37,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry you're lonely
but Enigma will not save you.</font>

814
01:00:38,050 --> 01:00:40,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you decipher that,
you fragile narcissist?</font>

815
01:00:40,554 --> 01:00:43,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or would you like me to go and fetch
your precious Christopher to help?</font>

816
01:00:49,313 --> 01:00:50,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

817
01:00:57,403 --> 01:01:00,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you...
I want you to stay because I like you.</font>

818
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:03,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like talking to you.</font>

819
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:06,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like talking to
you, too, Alan.</font>

820
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:16,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what if you weren't alone?
What if you had a husband?</font>

821
01:01:17,798 --> 01:01:19,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you have one in mind?</font>

822
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:21,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do.</font>

823
01:01:22,179 --> 01:01:23,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hugh?</font>

824
01:01:24,264 --> 01:01:25,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hugh's terribly attractive,
I'll give you that,</font>

825
01:01:25,766 --> 01:01:28,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I don't really think
he's the marrying kind.</font>

826
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:31,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I... I wasn't thinking of Hugh.</font>

827
01:01:31,103 --> 01:01:34,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or Peter. Peter's so quiet.</font>

828
01:01:39,612 --> 01:01:41,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

829
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:44,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But this makes sense.
- Did you just propose to me?</font>

830
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:47,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it is the
logical thing to do.</font>

831
01:01:47,621 --> 01:01:48,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is ridiculous.</font>

832
01:01:48,789 --> 01:01:49,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is your parents.</font>

833
01:01:49,873 --> 01:01:52,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't believe
that this is happening.</font>

834
01:01:57,005 --> 01:01:58,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">Joan...</font>

835
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:01,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is your middle name
Caroline or Catherine?</font>

836
01:02:01,635 --> 01:02:02,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">Elizabeth.</font>

837
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:06,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">Erm, Joan Elizabeth
Clarke, erm...</font>

838
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:11,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">will you marry me?</font>

839
01:02:20,362 --> 01:02:22,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's beautiful.</font>

840
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:25,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I know it isn't
ordinary but...</font>

841
01:02:27,411 --> 01:02:29,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">whoever loved ordinary?</font>

842
01:02:29,413 --> 01:02:31,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">She had it in both hands.</font>

843
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:34,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">And she looked up at me
with her doe eyes and said,</font>

844
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:36,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Am I supposed to put
that in my mouth?"</font>

845
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:40,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I said,
"Yes, you know, the French way."</font>

846
01:02:41,590 --> 01:02:44,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">So she pops it in,
clamps her lips around it,</font>

847
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:47,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">and starts humming
the bloody Marseillaise.</font>

848
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:53,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Come and have a dance.
- No, no, no, no.</font>

849
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:54,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can dance with your fiancé
any time you like.</font>

850
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:56,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right now, this moment...</font>

851
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:57,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">my turn.</font>

852
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:27,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the matter?</font>

853
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:34,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if...</font>

854
01:03:40,733 --> 01:03:45,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if I don't fancy being with Joan
in that way?</font>

855
01:03:48,742 --> 01:03:50,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because you're a homosexual?</font>

856
01:03:54,581 --> 01:03:56,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">I suspected.</font>

857
01:03:57,416 --> 01:04:01,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, should I tell her
that I've had affairs with men?</font>

858
01:04:03,088 --> 01:04:07,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, in my admittedly
limited experience,</font>

859
01:04:07,594 --> 01:04:11,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">women tend to be a bit touchy about
accidentally marrying homosexuals.</font>

860
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:16,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps not spreading this information
about might be in your best interest.</font>

861
01:04:19,773 --> 01:04:22,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">I care for her, I truly do. I...</font>

862
01:04:26,112 --> 01:04:29,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">I... I just don't
know if I can, erm...</font>

863
01:04:30,449 --> 01:04:33,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">- pretend about...
- You can't tell anyone, Alan.</font>

864
01:04:33,994 --> 01:04:35,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's illegal.</font>

865
01:04:36,623 --> 01:04:39,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Denniston is looking
for any excuse he can to put you away.</font>

866
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:42,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I know.
- This has to stay a secret.</font>

867
01:04:43,295 --> 01:04:44,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, it's your turn.</font>

868
01:04:45,215 --> 01:04:46,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, okay.</font>

869
01:05:31,844 --> 01:05:34,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a sport for girls!</font>

870
01:05:34,179 --> 01:05:36,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not a sport for girls!</font>

871
01:06:09,590 --> 01:06:12,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Cup of tea?
- No, thank you.</font>

872
01:06:26,608 --> 01:06:28,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Turing, can I
tell you a secret?</font>

873
01:06:29,152 --> 01:06:30,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm quite good with those.</font>

874
01:06:30,903 --> 01:06:32,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm here to help you.</font>

875
01:06:35,115 --> 01:06:36,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, clearly.</font>

876
01:06:43,958 --> 01:06:45,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can machines think?</font>

877
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:49,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, so you've read some
of my published works?</font>

878
01:06:49,338 --> 01:06:51,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">What makes you say that?</font>

879
01:06:51,757 --> 01:06:54,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, because I'm sitting
in a police station</font>

880
01:06:54,344 --> 01:06:56,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">accused of entreating
a young man to touch my penis</font>

881
01:06:56,929 --> 01:07:00,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you just asked me
if machines can think.</font>

882
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:04,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, can they?</font>

883
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:09,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could machines ever think
as human beings do?</font>

884
01:07:10,110 --> 01:07:11,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Most people say not.</font>

885
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:14,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not most people.</font>

886
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:20,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, the problem is
you're asking a stupid question.</font>

887
01:07:20,994 --> 01:07:22,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am?</font>

888
01:07:22,496 --> 01:07:26,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course machines
can't think as people do.</font>

889
01:07:27,501 --> 01:07:30,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">A machine is different
from a person.</font>

890
01:07:32,798 --> 01:07:34,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hence they think differently.</font>

891
01:07:38,471 --> 01:07:40,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">The interesting question is
just because something,</font>

892
01:07:40,974 --> 01:07:43,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">er, thinks differently from you,</font>

893
01:07:43,143 --> 01:07:45,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">does that mean
it's not thinking?</font>

894
01:07:47,813 --> 01:07:51,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we allow for humans to have
such divergences from one another.</font>

895
01:07:55,487 --> 01:07:57,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">You like strawberries.
I hate ice-skating.</font>

896
01:07:57,824 --> 01:08:00,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">You cry at sad films.</font>

897
01:08:00,702 --> 01:08:02,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am allergic to pollen.</font>

898
01:08:04,664 --> 01:08:07,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is the point
of different tastes, different...</font>

899
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:12,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">preferences if not to say
that our brains work differently,</font>

900
01:08:12,547 --> 01:08:14,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">that we think differently?</font>

901
01:08:17,092 --> 01:08:18,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if we can say
that about one another,</font>

902
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:22,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">then why can't we say
the same thing for brains</font>

903
01:08:22,222 --> 01:08:25,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">built of copper and wire, steel?</font>

904
01:08:26,351 --> 01:08:31,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's this big paper you wrote?
What's it called?</font>

905
01:08:32,524 --> 01:08:34,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Imitation Game.</font>

906
01:08:34,194 --> 01:08:36,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right, that's...
That's what it's about?</font>

907
01:08:42,202 --> 01:08:43,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you like to play?</font>

908
01:08:44,369 --> 01:08:46,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Play?
- It's a game.</font>

909
01:08:46,872 --> 01:08:48,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">A test of sorts.</font>

910
01:08:49,708 --> 01:08:54,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">For determining whether something
is a... a machine or a human being.</font>

911
01:08:55,215 --> 01:08:58,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How do I play?
- Well, there's a judge and a subject.</font>

912
01:08:59,719 --> 01:09:03,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the judge asks questions
and depending on the subject's answers,</font>

913
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:08,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">determines who he is talking with, er,
what he is talking with and, um,</font>

914
01:09:10,814 --> 01:09:13,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">all you have to do is
ask me a question.</font>

915
01:09:19,154 --> 01:09:20,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did you do during the war?</font>

916
01:09:20,907 --> 01:09:23,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">I worked in a radio factory.</font>

917
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:27,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did you really
do during the war?</font>

918
01:09:31,917 --> 01:09:33,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you paying attention?</font>

919
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:54,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn it!</font>

920
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:04,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're soon out of time.
Our month.</font>

921
01:10:05,784 --> 01:10:07,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">So that's it, then, is it?</font>

922
01:10:07,453 --> 01:10:09,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, the trouble is it doesn't matter
how much we improve it.</font>

923
01:10:09,831 --> 01:10:11,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">The machine's never
going to be able to process</font>

924
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:13,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">159 million million million
possibilities in time.</font>

925
01:10:13,835 --> 01:10:15,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just bloody hopeless.</font>

926
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:18,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's searching. It's just...</font>

927
01:10:19,673 --> 01:10:21,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">It doesn't know what
it's searching for.</font>

928
01:10:22,676 --> 01:10:24,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we knew what the messages
were going to say...</font>

929
01:10:24,386 --> 01:10:25,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we knew what the messages
were going to say,</font>

930
01:10:26,014 --> 01:10:27,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">we wouldn't have to
decrypt them at all.</font>

931
01:10:33,061 --> 01:10:34,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's Alan's friend?</font>

932
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:37,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hugh? He's a bit of
a cad, actually.</font>

933
01:10:38,734 --> 01:10:40,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">So my type, then?</font>

934
01:10:40,235 --> 01:10:42,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, I'll introduce you.
- No...</font>

935
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:44,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll come over.</font>

936
01:10:44,532 --> 01:10:46,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are you sure?
- Yes.</font>

937
01:10:46,492 --> 01:10:49,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">I smiled at him 15 minutes ago
and haven't looked back since.</font>

938
01:10:52,039 --> 01:10:53,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who's that with Joan?
- Mmm?</font>

939
01:10:54,833 --> 01:10:57,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Er, Helen. Works with her.</font>

940
01:10:57,170 --> 01:10:58,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's really pretty.</font>

941
01:10:58,712 --> 01:11:00,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">She wants me to come over.</font>

942
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:02,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? How... How on earth
can you know that?</font>

943
01:11:03,009 --> 01:11:05,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">She smiled at me a while back
and she hasn't looked again since.</font>

944
01:11:12,185 --> 01:11:13,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">And got him.</font>

945
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:17,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, why is this, that when
I was single I found it very boring,</font>

946
01:11:17,439 --> 01:11:20,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">but now that I'm engaged,
I just find it dreadfully fun?</font>

947
01:11:22,779 --> 01:11:24,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bingo, she's in.</font>

948
01:11:24,279 --> 01:11:25,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alan, introduce us.</font>

949
01:11:26,032 --> 01:11:28,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?
Why me?</font>

950
01:11:30,203 --> 01:11:31,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because there's nothing
like a friend's engagement</font>

951
01:11:31,912 --> 01:11:33,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">to make a woman want to do
something she'll later regret</font>

952
01:11:34,082 --> 01:11:37,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">with the fiancé's
better-looking chum. Let's go.</font>

953
01:11:42,547 --> 01:11:45,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">Half a crown says
Alan bollockses this up entirely.</font>

954
01:11:45,717 --> 01:11:47,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">No bet.</font>

955
01:11:47,261 --> 01:11:49,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Alan Turing has a theory.
- He has many.</font>

956
01:11:50,222 --> 01:11:52,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">He believes that the regulations
against men and women</font>

957
01:11:52,557 --> 01:11:54,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">working side by side are sound</font>

958
01:11:55,060 --> 01:11:57,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">because such proximity
will necessarily lead to romance.</font>

959
01:11:57,604 --> 01:12:00,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Er, what? No, I don't. I...
- However, I disagree.</font>

960
01:12:01,067 --> 01:12:02,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You do?
- Yeah.</font>

961
01:12:02,652 --> 01:12:05,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think that if I were working
beside a woman all day long,</font>

962
01:12:05,113 --> 01:12:07,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could appreciate
her abilities and intellect</font>

963
01:12:07,907 --> 01:12:09,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">without taking her to bed.</font>

964
01:12:11,243 --> 01:12:12,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, have we met?</font>

965
01:12:13,246 --> 01:12:15,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't recall.
But let's assume we haven't.</font>

966
01:12:15,414 --> 01:12:17,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">Helen Stewart, Hugh Alexander.</font>

967
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:19,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">So who do you agree with?
Alan or myself?</font>

968
01:12:19,127 --> 01:12:20,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, Alan, of course.</font>

969
01:12:21,587 --> 01:12:23,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm very flattered really, but I...
I don't think that...</font>

970
01:12:23,965 --> 01:12:25,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rubbish.</font>

971
01:12:25,591 --> 01:12:27,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I work beside
a man every day</font>

972
01:12:27,969 --> 01:12:30,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I can't help but have developed
a bit of a crush on him.</font>

973
01:12:30,304 --> 01:12:32,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, who is this man?
So I can kick his arse.</font>

974
01:12:32,265 --> 01:12:34,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, there's no need to worry,
it's been chaste.</font>

975
01:12:34,266 --> 01:12:37,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've never even met.
He's a German.</font>

976
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:39,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now I really want to kill him.</font>

977
01:12:39,479 --> 01:12:43,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Er... How... How do you mean
you work alongside a German?</font>

978
01:12:43,984 --> 01:12:47,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, each of us intercepts messages
from a specific German radio tower.</font>

979
01:12:47,488 --> 01:12:49,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we have a counterpart
on the other side</font>

980
01:12:49,114 --> 01:12:50,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">who's tip-tapping
out the messages.</font>

981
01:12:50,615 --> 01:12:52,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone types a
touch differently,</font>

982
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:54,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">so you get to know
the rhythm of your counterpart.</font>

983
01:12:54,619 --> 01:12:56,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's strangely intimate.</font>

984
01:12:56,456 --> 01:12:58,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">I feel as if I know him so well.</font>

985
01:12:58,457 --> 01:12:59,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a pity he has a girlfriend</font>

986
01:12:59,833 --> 01:13:02,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">but that's why I disagree
with you, Mr. Alexander,</font>

987
01:13:02,545 --> 01:13:04,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">because I'm in love
with a co-worker of sorts</font>

988
01:13:04,463 --> 01:13:05,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we've never even met.</font>

989
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:09,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, allow me to buy you another pint
and I'll tell you why you're wrong.</font>

990
01:13:09,801 --> 01:13:11,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's.</font>

991
01:13:11,636 --> 01:13:13,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excellent.</font>

992
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:17,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks.</font>

993
01:13:17,643 --> 01:13:21,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">Erm... Pints and a sloe gin.</font>

994
01:13:24,317 --> 01:13:26,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">In case you were wondering,
that's what flirting looks like.</font>

995
01:13:26,694 --> 01:13:28,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">Helen!</font>

996
01:13:29,488 --> 01:13:31,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Alan!
- Yes, Alan?</font>

997
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:35,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you think your German
counterpart has a girlfriend?</font>

998
01:13:35,368 --> 01:13:36,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just a stupid joke.
Don't worry about it.</font>

999
01:13:36,996 --> 01:13:38,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no, no, no. Tell me.</font>

1000
01:13:39,998 --> 01:13:42,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, each of his messages
begins with the same five letters.</font>

1001
01:13:42,335 --> 01:13:44,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">C-I-L-L-Y.</font>

1002
01:13:44,837 --> 01:13:47,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I suspect that Cilly
must be the name of his amore.</font>

1003
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:49,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">But that's impossible.
The Germans are instructed to use</font>

1004
01:13:49,509 --> 01:13:51,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">five random letters
at the start of every message.</font>

1005
01:13:51,676 --> 01:13:53,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, this bloke doesn't.</font>

1006
01:13:53,762 --> 01:13:56,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Love will make a man
do strange things, I suppose.</font>

1007
01:13:56,515 --> 01:13:58,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">In this case,</font>

1008
01:13:58,184 --> 01:14:00,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">love just lost Germany
the whole bloody war!</font>

1009
01:14:00,895 --> 01:14:02,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh!
- Go, Peter.</font>

1010
01:14:04,689 --> 01:14:06,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry.</font>

1011
01:14:07,859 --> 01:14:09,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alan!</font>

1012
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:12,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alan!</font>

1013
01:14:12,614 --> 01:14:14,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Whoa, whoa!
- Stop!</font>

1014
01:14:16,202 --> 01:14:17,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, no, no...
- Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!</font>

1015
01:14:19,538 --> 01:14:22,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hugh Alexander. John Cairncross.
Peter bloody Hilton.</font>

1016
01:14:23,042 --> 01:14:24,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alan?</font>

1017
01:14:24,961 --> 01:14:26,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">What...</font>

1018
01:14:29,090 --> 01:14:31,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">What... What if...</font>

1019
01:14:31,466 --> 01:14:35,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if Christopher doesn't have to
search through all of the settings?</font>

1020
01:14:36,096 --> 01:14:38,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if he only has
to search through</font>

1021
01:14:38,557 --> 01:14:41,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">ones that produce words we already
know will be in the message?</font>

1022
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:44,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Repeated words. Predictable words.
- Exactly.</font>

1023
01:14:47,733 --> 01:14:49,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look. Look, like this one.</font>

1024
01:14:49,402 --> 01:14:51,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">"0600 hours. Weather today is clear.
Rain in the evening.</font>

1025

1026
01:14:55,073 --> 01:14:56,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that's it.</font>

1027
01:14:56,701 --> 01:14:58,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">Exactly.</font>

1028
01:14:58,202 --> 01:15:01,512

01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:17,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm so sorry.</font>

1177
01:23:19,078 --> 01:23:22,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not God, Alan, you don't
get to decide who lives and who dies.</font>

1178
01:23:23,332 --> 01:23:24,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, we do.</font>

1179
01:23:28,045 --> 01:23:29,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

1180
01:23:29,380 --> 01:23:31,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because no one else can.</font>

1181
01:24:20,055 --> 01:24:21,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you telling me this?</font>

1182
01:24:22,807 --> 01:24:28,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need your help to keep this a secret
from Admiralty, Army, RAF.</font>

1183
01:24:29,814 --> 01:24:34,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one can know we broke Enigma.
Not even Denniston.</font>

1184
01:24:35,654 --> 01:24:37,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's in the process
of having you fired.</font>

1185
01:24:38,073 --> 01:24:39,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can take care of that.</font>

1186
01:24:40,117 --> 01:24:42,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">While we develop a system
to help you determine</font>

1187
01:24:42,327 --> 01:24:45,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">how much intelligence to act on.</font>

1188
01:24:45,413 --> 01:24:47,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which, er, attacks to stop,
which to let through.</font>

1189
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:50,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">Statistical analysis.</font>

1190
01:24:50,418 --> 01:24:54,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">The minimal number of actions
it would take for us to win the war</font>

1191
01:24:55,340 --> 01:24:59,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">but the maximum number we can take
before the Germans get suspicious.</font>

1192
01:25:00,511 --> 01:25:03,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you're going to
trust all this to statistics?</font>

1193
01:25:05,184 --> 01:25:06,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">- To maths?
- Correct.</font>

1194
01:25:06,769 --> 01:25:10,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then MI6 can come up with
the lies that we tell everybody else.</font>

1195
01:25:10,439 --> 01:25:12,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll need a believable
alternative source</font>

1196
01:25:12,690 --> 01:25:15,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">for all the pieces
of information you use.</font>

1197
01:25:15,359 --> 01:25:17,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">A false story so
that we can explain</font>

1198
01:25:17,529 --> 01:25:20,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">how we got our information
that has nothing to do with Enigma.</font>

1199
01:25:20,532 --> 01:25:23,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then you can leak those
stories to the, er, the Germans.</font>

1200
01:25:23,702 --> 01:25:25,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then to our own military.</font>

1201
01:25:31,542 --> 01:25:35,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maintain a conspiracy of lies
at the highest levels of government?</font>

1202
01:25:44,139 --> 01:25:45,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sounds right up my alley.</font>

1203
01:25:49,728 --> 01:25:53,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alan, I so rarely
have cause to say this,</font>

1204
01:25:53,148 --> 01:25:56,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you are exactly the man
I always hoped you would be.</font>

1205
01:26:10,582 --> 01:26:13,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">They codenamed it Ultra.</font>

1206
01:26:13,543 --> 01:26:17,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">It became the largest store
of military intelligence</font>

1207
01:26:18,090 --> 01:26:19,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the history of the world.</font>

1208
01:26:26,765 --> 01:26:29,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was like having a tap
on Himmler's intercom.</font>

1209
01:26:30,601 --> 01:26:32,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">I-E-O...</font>

1210
01:26:33,396 --> 01:26:34,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">T-X-X...</font>

1211
01:26:34,898 --> 01:26:37,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">Secrecy became the primary concern</font>

1212
01:26:37,192 --> 01:26:40,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">and for some reason, they...
They trusted me.</font>

1213
01:26:41,947 --> 01:26:46,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peter, do you have the, er...
the 6:30 decrypt?</font>

1214
01:27:27,158 --> 01:27:28,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a Beale cipher.</font>

1215
01:27:28,784 --> 01:27:30,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">Encrypted with a
phrase from a...</font>

1216
01:27:30,328 --> 01:27:33,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Ask, and it shall be given
to you; seek and ye will find."</font>

1217
01:27:33,247 --> 01:27:35,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Matthew 7:7.
That was the key.</font>

1218
01:27:35,792 --> 01:27:38,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peter will come
around eventually.</font>

1219
01:27:46,677 --> 01:27:48,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jack?</font>

1220
01:27:48,596 --> 01:27:50,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could you give Alan
and me a moment, please?</font>

1221
01:28:02,444 --> 01:28:05,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Soviets and us,
we're on the same side.</font>

1222
01:28:06,323 --> 01:28:08,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">What I'm doing
will help Britain.</font>

1223
01:28:08,992 --> 01:28:11,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to tell Denniston.</font>

1224
01:28:12,537 --> 01:28:13,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you don't.</font>

1225
01:28:15,122 --> 01:28:17,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because if you tell
him my secret,</font>

1226
01:28:18,210 --> 01:28:19,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll tell him yours.</font>

1227
01:28:22,046 --> 01:28:24,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know what they
do to homosexuals?</font>

1228
01:28:25,884 --> 01:28:28,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll never be able to work again.
Never be able to teach.</font>

1229
01:28:29,011 --> 01:28:30,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your precious machine?</font>

1230
01:28:31,555 --> 01:28:33,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">I doubt you'll ever
see him again.</font>

1231
01:28:49,740 --> 01:28:51,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello. Can I...</font>

1232
01:28:51,158 --> 01:28:53,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">um, speak to Stewart Menzies,
please? It's urgent.</font>

1233
01:28:54,078 --> 01:28:56,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">One moment, please.</font>

1234
01:28:59,417 --> 01:29:01,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello. Menzies.</font>

1235
01:29:04,338 --> 01:29:07,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some advice about keeping secrets.</font>

1236
01:29:09,761 --> 01:29:13,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a lot easier if you
don't know them in the first place.</font>

1237
01:29:14,599 --> 01:29:18,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">Were they steaming my letters,
tapping my telephone?</font>

1238
01:29:18,936 --> 01:29:21,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">Trailing my nervous walks?</font>

1239
01:29:22,399 --> 01:29:23,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I...</font>

1240
01:29:24,775 --> 01:29:26,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never did find out.</font>

1241
01:29:27,445 --> 01:29:29,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">Joan?</font>

1242
01:29:33,243 --> 01:29:35,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Joan? What's...</font>

1243
01:29:37,872 --> 01:29:40,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Where's Joan?</font>

1244
01:29:41,626 --> 01:29:43,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">Military prison.</font>

1245
01:29:45,796 --> 01:29:47,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">What have you done?</font>

1246
01:29:47,798 --> 01:29:49,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Decoded Enigma intercepts.</font>

1247
01:29:49,426 --> 01:29:51,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">I found a pile of them
in the bedside table.</font>

1248
01:29:51,302 --> 01:29:54,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no. I... I gave those to her
over a year ago</font>

1249
01:29:54,597 --> 01:29:56,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">when I was trying to figure out</font>

1250
01:29:56,475 --> 01:29:58,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">- a link between...
- I'm sure you did.</font>

1251
01:29:58,435 --> 01:30:00,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">Denniston's been looking
for a Soviet spy.</font>

1252
01:30:00,479 --> 01:30:02,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's been looking inside Hut 8.</font>

1253
01:30:03,981 --> 01:30:05,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know who the spy is.</font>

1254
01:30:07,109 --> 01:30:09,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">It... It's not Joan. It's...</font>

1255
01:30:10,654 --> 01:30:12,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Cairncross.</font>

1256
01:30:12,823 --> 01:30:16,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">I... I found the Beale cipher,
the Bible.</font>

1257
01:30:17,328 --> 01:30:19,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">God, I wish you'd been the spy.</font>

1258
01:30:21,291 --> 01:30:23,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'd be so much better
at this than he is.</font>

1259
01:30:24,795 --> 01:30:26,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">You knew it was him?</font>

1260
01:30:26,671 --> 01:30:28,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course I bloody knew.</font>

1261
01:30:28,590 --> 01:30:30,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew before he
came to Bletchley.</font>

1262
01:30:31,592 --> 01:30:33,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you think I
had him placed here?</font>

1263
01:30:33,177 --> 01:30:35,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we have an Enigma machine.</font>

1264
01:30:36,139 --> 01:30:37,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, Polish Intelligence smuggled...</font>

1265
01:30:37,515 --> 01:30:38,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what's the problem?</font>

1266
01:30:39,016 --> 01:30:43,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">You placed a...
a Soviet agent at Bletchley Park?</font>

1267
01:30:43,604 --> 01:30:46,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's really quite useful to be able to
leak whatever we want to Stalin.</font>

1268
01:30:48,609 --> 01:30:50,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">Churchill's too damn paranoid.</font>

1269
01:30:50,945 --> 01:30:54,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">He won't share a shred
of intelligence with the Soviets.</font>

1270
01:30:54,990 --> 01:30:57,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not even information that
will help them against the Germans.</font>

1271
01:30:57,368 --> 01:31:00,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's... so much secrecy.</font>

1272
01:31:02,123 --> 01:31:05,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cairncross has no idea
we know, of course.</font>

1273
01:31:05,210 --> 01:31:07,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's really not the
brightest bulb.</font>

1274
01:31:09,171 --> 01:31:11,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which is why I need your help.</font>

1275
01:31:11,507 --> 01:31:13,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to know what
to leak to John,</font>

1276
01:31:13,217 --> 01:31:15,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">what to feed to the Soviets
as well as the British.</font>

1277
01:31:16,011 --> 01:31:17,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">I...</font>

1278
01:31:18,055 --> 01:31:20,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not a... I'm not a spy.
I'm...</font>

1279
01:31:21,309 --> 01:31:23,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just a mathematician.</font>

1280
01:31:23,979 --> 01:31:26,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know a lot of spies, Alan.</font>

1281
01:31:27,314 --> 01:31:30,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've got more secrets
than the best of them.</font>

1282
01:31:34,655 --> 01:31:38,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">You... You have to promise me
that you will release Joan.</font>

1283
01:31:38,993 --> 01:31:40,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, Joan's at the market.</font>

1284
01:31:40,494 --> 01:31:42,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's going to be back
in an hour. I lied.</font>

1285
01:31:44,916 --> 01:31:46,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd better hold on to these.</font>

1286
01:31:46,877 --> 01:31:50,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">If anybody finds out about them,
prison will be the least of her worries.</font>

1287
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:54,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Alan,</font>

1288
01:31:56,051 --> 01:31:58,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">we're going to have
such a wonderful war together.</font>

1289
01:32:18,115 --> 01:32:19,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need you to leave Bletchley.</font>

1290
01:32:19,783 --> 01:32:20,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

1291
01:32:20,952 --> 01:32:23,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Menzies. I don't trust him.</font>

1292
01:32:23,454 --> 01:32:25,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not safe here.</font>

1293
01:32:25,207 --> 01:32:26,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think it's
any safer anywhere else?</font>

1294
01:32:26,875 --> 01:32:29,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need to get away.
You need to get very far away from me.</font>

1295
01:32:29,377 --> 01:32:30,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alan, what's happened?</font>

1296
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:37,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't be engaged any more.
You...</font>

1297
01:32:37,969 --> 01:32:41,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your parents need to take you back
and find you a husband elsewhere.</font>

1298
01:32:43,390 --> 01:32:45,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's wrong with you?</font>

1299
01:32:46,435 --> 01:32:49,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have something,
er, to tell you.</font>

1300
01:32:49,648 --> 01:32:50,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm...</font>

1301
01:32:53,984 --> 01:32:55,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a homosexual.</font>

1302
01:32:58,739 --> 01:33:01,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">- All right.
- No, no. Men, Joan.</font>

1303
01:33:03,578 --> 01:33:05,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Not women.
- So what?</font>

1304
01:33:06,497 --> 01:33:08,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I... I just told you.</font>

1305
01:33:08,123 --> 01:33:09,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what?</font>

1306
01:33:12,671 --> 01:33:14,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had my suspicions,
I always did.</font>

1307
01:33:16,173 --> 01:33:20,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we're not like other people.
We love each other in our own way</font>

1308
01:33:20,136 --> 01:33:22,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we can have the life together
that we want.</font>

1309
01:33:22,305 --> 01:33:24,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">You... You won't be
the perfect husband.</font>

1310
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:28,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I can promise you, I harbour
no intention of being the perfect wife.</font>

1311
01:33:28,936 --> 01:33:33,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll not be fixing your lamb all day
while you come home from the office.</font>

1312
01:33:33,524 --> 01:33:35,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll work.</font>

1313
01:33:35,944 --> 01:33:37,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll work.</font>

1314
01:33:39,029 --> 01:33:41,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we'll have each
other's company.</font>

1315
01:33:41,865 --> 01:33:44,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll have each other's minds.</font>

1316
01:33:44,661 --> 01:33:47,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">That sounds like a better
marriage than most.</font>

1317
01:33:49,707 --> 01:33:51,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I care for you.</font>

1318
01:33:52,877 --> 01:33:54,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you care for me.</font>

1319
01:33:56,547 --> 01:33:58,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we understand
one another more than...</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't.</font>

1322
01:34:07,725 --> 01:34:09,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- Care for you.</font>

1323
01:34:10,228 --> 01:34:11,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never did.</font>

1324
01:34:11,729 --> 01:34:14,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">I... I just needed
you to break Enigma.</font>

1325
01:34:14,858 --> 01:34:17,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've done that now, so...
So you can go.</font>

1326
01:34:23,490 --> 01:34:25,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not going anywhere.</font>

1327
01:34:26,869 --> 01:34:28,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've spent entirely
too much of my life</font>

1328
01:34:28,747 --> 01:34:30,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">worried about what
you think of me</font>

1329
01:34:30,332 --> 01:34:32,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">or what my parents think of me</font>

1330
01:34:32,333 --> 01:34:34,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">or the boys in Hut 8
or the girls in Hut 3.</font>

1331
01:34:34,502 --> 01:34:36,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">And do you know what? I'm done.</font>

1332
01:34:37,671 --> 01:34:40,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the most important
work I will ever do</font>

1333
01:34:41,009 --> 01:34:44,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">and no one is going to stop me,
least of all you.</font>

1334
01:34:47,265 --> 01:34:49,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know what?
They were right.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">You really are a monster.</font>

1337
01:35:17,002 --> 01:35:21,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">The war dragged on
for two more solitary years</font>

1338
01:35:24,135 --> 01:35:27,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">and every day we performed
our blood-soaked calculus.</font>

1339
01:35:30,100 --> 01:35:33,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every day we decided
who lived and who died.</font>

1340
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:38,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every day we helped the Allies
to victories and nobody knew.</font>

1341
01:35:42,569 --> 01:35:44,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stalingrad.</font>

1342
01:35:44,905 --> 01:35:47,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Ardenne.
The invasion of Normandy.</font>

1343
01:35:48,993 --> 01:35:51,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">All victories that would not
have been possible</font>

1344
01:35:51,246 --> 01:35:53,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">without the intelligence
that we supplied.</font>

1345
01:35:54,748 --> 01:35:57,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">And people talk about the war</font>

1346
01:35:57,752 --> 01:36:01,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">as this epic battle
between civilisations.</font>

1347
01:36:03,550 --> 01:36:07,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Freedom versus tyranny.
Democracy versus Nazism.</font>

1348
01:36:08,637 --> 01:36:12,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">Armies of millions
bleeding into the ground.</font>

1349
01:36:12,850 --> 01:36:16,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fleets of ships
weighing down the oceans.</font>

1350
01:36:16,104 --> 01:36:20,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">Planes dropping bombs from the sky
until they obliterated the sun itself.</font>

1351
01:36:22,152 --> 01:36:24,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">The war wasn't like that for us.</font>

1352
01:36:27,614 --> 01:36:29,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">For us it was just...</font>

1353
01:36:31,034 --> 01:36:32,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">half a dozen crossword
enthusiasts</font>

1354
01:36:33,078 --> 01:36:35,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">in a tiny village
in the South of England.</font>

1355
01:36:38,710 --> 01:36:40,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">your victory.</font>

1356
01:36:40,545 --> 01:36:42,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is the victory</font>

1357
01:36:43,256 --> 01:36:47,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">of the cause of freedom
in every land.</font>

1358
01:36:51,972 --> 01:36:55,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a solemn but glorious hour.</font>

1359
01:36:56,810 --> 01:37:01,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish that Franklin D Roosevelt
had lived to see this day.</font>

1360
01:37:02,274 --> 01:37:04,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was I God? No.</font>

1361
01:37:04,569 --> 01:37:07,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because God didn't win the war,</font>

1362
01:37:08,655 --> 01:37:10,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">we did.</font>

1363
01:37:22,628 --> 01:37:24,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what happens now?</font>

1364
01:37:26,216 --> 01:37:29,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it back to university for us,
I suppose?</font>

1365
01:37:30,220 --> 01:37:31,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, pretty much.</font>

1366
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:33,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you've one other
thing left to do</font>

1367
01:37:33,389 --> 01:37:35,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">before your service
to your government is concluded.</font>

1368
01:37:35,682 --> 01:37:38,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's that?
- Burn everything.</font>

1369
01:37:38,685 --> 01:37:40,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Burn? Why?</font>

1370
01:37:40,229 --> 01:37:43,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were told when you started
this was a top secret programme.</font>

1371
01:37:43,358 --> 01:37:45,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you think we were joking?</font>

1372
01:37:45,818 --> 01:37:47,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the war is over.</font>

1373
01:37:47,362 --> 01:37:49,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">This war is.
But there'll be others.</font>

1374
01:37:49,697 --> 01:37:52,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we know how to break a code</font>

1375
01:37:52,115 --> 01:37:54,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">that everybody else
believes is unbreakable.</font>

1376
01:37:55,619 --> 01:37:57,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">Precisely.</font>

1377
01:37:58,706 --> 01:38:00,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tear it down, light it up.</font>

1378
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:03,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sweep away the ashes.
None of you have ever met before.</font>

1379
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:07,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">None of you have ever
even heard the word "Enigma".</font>

1380
01:38:09,425 --> 01:38:11,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have a safe trip home.</font>

1381
01:38:14,596 --> 01:38:16,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">Behave.</font>

1382
01:38:16,390 --> 01:38:18,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">With a bit of luck,
you'll never have to see me</font>

1383
01:38:18,184 --> 01:38:20,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">or one another again
for the rest of your lives.</font>

1384
01:38:36,243 --> 01:38:37,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's unbelievable.</font>

1385
01:38:39,913 --> 01:38:41,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, Detective,</font>

1386
01:38:43,835 --> 01:38:45,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">you get to judge.</font>

1387
01:38:48,088 --> 01:38:49,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">So tell me,</font>

1388
01:38:51,341 --> 01:38:52,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">what am I?</font>

1389
01:38:54,636 --> 01:38:58,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">Am I a machine?
Am I a person?</font>

1390
01:39:00,350 --> 01:39:02,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">Am I a war hero?</font>

1391
01:39:04,605 --> 01:39:06,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Am I a criminal?</font>

1392
01:39:10,485 --> 01:39:12,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't judge you.</font>

1393
01:39:15,449 --> 01:39:17,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, then.</font>

1394
01:39:20,329 --> 01:39:23,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're no help to me at all.</font>

1395
01:39:26,293 --> 01:39:27,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come in.</font>

1396
01:39:32,257 --> 01:39:34,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanted to see me, sir?</font>

1397
01:39:34,385 --> 01:39:36,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">Turing. Sit down.</font>

1398
01:39:48,483 --> 01:39:50,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is something the matter?</font>

1399
01:39:50,902 --> 01:39:53,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">You and Christopher Morcom
are quite close.</font>

1400
01:39:53,529 --> 01:39:55,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wouldn't say that.</font>

1401
01:39:55,489 --> 01:39:56,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, your mathematics
teacher says</font>

1402
01:39:57,074 --> 01:39:58,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">the two of you
are positively inseparable.</font>

1403
01:39:58,784 --> 01:40:00,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're the best
students in the class.</font>

1404
01:40:01,703 --> 01:40:03,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">He caught you passing
notes the other day.</font>

1405
01:40:03,789 --> 01:40:06,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cryptography, to pass the time.
The class is too simple.</font>

1406
01:40:06,917 --> 01:40:10,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">You and your friend solve
maths problems during maths class</font>

1407
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:12,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">because the maths
class is too dull?</font>

1408
01:40:13,423 --> 01:40:15,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not my friend.</font>

1409
01:40:15,217 --> 01:40:18,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, I'm told he's your only friend.
- Who said that?</font>

1410
01:40:21,724 --> 01:40:24,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something's come up
concerning Morcom.</font>

1411
01:40:25,269 --> 01:40:26,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why am I here?</font>

1412
01:40:29,606 --> 01:40:31,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">Christopher is dead.</font>

1413
01:40:39,908 --> 01:40:41,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't understand.</font>

1414
01:40:41,577 --> 01:40:45,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">His mother sent word this morning.
The family were on holiday, you see.</font>

1415
01:40:50,168 --> 01:40:51,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't understand.</font>

1416
01:40:51,837 --> 01:40:55,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, he had bovine tuberculosis,
as I'm sure he told you.</font>

1417
01:40:56,926 --> 01:41:02,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">So this won't come as a shock
but still, all the same, I'm sorry.</font>

1418
01:41:04,434 --> 01:41:06,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're mistaken.</font>

1419
01:41:07,686 --> 01:41:09,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did he not tell you?</font>

1420
01:41:10,355 --> 01:41:12,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, he's been sick
for a long time.</font>

1421
01:41:12,859 --> 01:41:15,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">He knew this was coming soon.</font>

1422
01:41:16,319 --> 01:41:18,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">But he had a stiff
upper lip about it.</font>

1423
01:41:18,238 --> 01:41:19,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good lad.</font>

1424
01:41:21,826 --> 01:41:23,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are you all right, Turing?
- Yes. Of course.</font>

1425
01:41:23,953 --> 01:41:26,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like I said,
I didn't know him very well.</font>

1426
01:41:26,872 --> 01:41:30,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, I see. Very well.</font>

1427
01:41:34,630 --> 01:41:37,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">May I leave, Headmaster?</font>

1428
01:41:51,229 --> 01:41:53,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">Congratulations, sir.</font>

1429
01:42:20,717 --> 01:42:22,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry.</font>

1430
01:42:26,681 --> 01:42:29,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would have come.
I would have testified.</font>

1431
01:42:30,853 --> 01:42:34,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what would you have said?
That I... I wasn't a homosexual?</font>

1432
01:42:34,731 --> 01:42:38,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alan, this is serious.
They could send you to jail.</font>

1433
01:42:38,277 --> 01:42:39,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, damn it.</font>

1434
01:42:43,032 --> 01:42:46,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Your hands, you're twitching.
- No. No, I'm not.</font>

1435
01:42:46,202 --> 01:42:47,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Alan.
- Er...</font>

1436
01:42:49,788 --> 01:42:51,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the medication.</font>

1437
01:42:52,707 --> 01:42:54,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">The medication?</font>

1438
01:42:55,545 --> 01:42:59,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, the judge gave
me, um, a choice.</font>

1439
01:42:59,256 --> 01:43:03,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">Either two years in prison or
hor... hormonal therapy.</font>

1440
01:43:03,511 --> 01:43:05,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

1441
01:43:05,971 --> 01:43:08,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, my God!
- Yes, yes, that's right.</font>

1442
01:43:08,474 --> 01:43:11,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chemical castration.</font>

1443
01:43:11,101 --> 01:43:15,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">To, er, to cure me of my, um,
homosexual predilections.</font>

1444
01:43:16,858 --> 01:43:19,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, of course I chose that.
I mean, I couldn't...</font>

01:43:20,694 --> 01:43:22,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">work in prison and...</font>

1446
01:43:23,698 --> 01:43:25,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

1447
01:43:26,951 --> 01:43:28,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, I'm going to speak
to your doctors.</font>

1448
01:43:28,953 --> 01:43:31,689

- I'm... I'm fine.</font>

1449
01:43:31,788 --> 01:43:33,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Please let me help you.
- No, I...</font>

1450
01:43:33,623 --> 01:43:36,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't need your help,
thank you.</font>

1451
01:43:36,627 --> 01:43:38,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alan, you do not have
to do this alone.</font>

1452
01:43:39,838 --> 01:43:41,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not alone.</font>

1453
01:43:45,094 --> 01:43:46,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never have been.</font>

1454
01:43:51,182 --> 01:43:53,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">Christopher's become so smart.</font>

my treatment, then they'll...</font>

1456
01:44:04,697 --> 01:44:07,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'll take him away from me.</font>

1457
01:44:08,242 --> 01:44:09,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">You...</font>

1458
01:44:12,622 --> 01:44:16,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">You... You... You can't let them
do that. You can't.</font>

1459
01:44:17,627 --> 01:44:20,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">You... You can't
let them leave me alone.</font>

1460
01:44:23,591 --> 01:44:25,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't...
I don't want to be alone.</font>

1462
01:44:26,927 --> 01:44:28,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, all right.</font>

1463
01:44:28,930 --> 01:44:31,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

1464
01:44:31,932 --> 01:44:34,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all right,
come and sit down.</font>

1465
01:44:37,438 --> 01:44:39,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all right.
Come and sit down.</font>

1466
01:44:43,444 --> 01:44:45,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all right.</font>

1467
01:44:55,497 --> 01:44:58,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, well...</font>

1468
01:44:59,042 --> 01:45:02,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a much nicer ring
than the one I... I made you.</font>

1469
01:45:02,421 --> 01:45:04,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

1470
01:45:04,172 --> 01:45:05,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">His name's Jock.</font>

1471
01:45:06,007 --> 01:45:08,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's an army man, if
you can believe it.</font>

1472
01:45:08,844 --> 01:45:11,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">We work together.</font>

1473
01:45:14,350 --> 01:45:16,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't we do a
crossword puzzle?</font>

1474
01:45:18,229 --> 01:45:20,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">It'll only take us five minutes.</font>

1475
01:45:20,189 --> 01:45:21,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or in your case, six.</font>

1476
01:45:26,820 --> 01:45:28,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">There.</font>

1477
01:45:51,720 --> 01:45:53,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps later.</font>

1478
01:45:55,056 --> 01:45:56,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, of course.</font>

1479
01:46:02,439 --> 01:46:04,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got what you
wanted, didn't you?</font>

1480
01:46:05,650 --> 01:46:07,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">Work, a husband.</font>

1481
01:46:08,570 --> 01:46:10,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Normal life.</font>

1482
01:46:20,416 --> 01:46:23,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one normal could
have done that.</font>

1483
01:46:27,006 --> 01:46:29,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know, this morning,</font>

1484
01:46:30,216 --> 01:46:34,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was on a train that went
through a city that wouldn't exist</font>

1485
01:46:34,637 --> 01:46:36,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">if it wasn't for you.</font>

1486
01:46:38,309 --> 01:46:42,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">I bought a ticket from a man
who would likely be dead</font>

1487
01:46:42,771 --> 01:46:45,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">if it wasn't for you.</font>

1488
01:46:45,106 --> 01:46:47,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">I read up on my work,</font>

1489
01:46:48,319 --> 01:46:51,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">a whole field of
scientific inquiry</font>

1490
01:46:51,947 --> 01:46:55,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">that only exists because of you.</font>

1491
01:46:58,162 --> 01:47:01,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, if you wish
you could have been normal,</font>

1492
01:47:03,458 --> 01:47:05,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can promise you, I do not.</font>

1493
01:47:07,837 --> 01:47:10,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">The world is an
infinitely better place</font>

1494
01:47:10,716 --> 01:47:13,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">precisely because you weren't.</font>

1495
01:47:16,846 --> 01:47:18,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you...</font>

1496
01:47:19,015 --> 01:47:20,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you really think that?</font>

1497
01:47:22,394 --> 01:47:23,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think</font>

1498
01:47:25,021 --> 01:47:28,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">that sometimes it is the people
who no one imagines anything of</font>

1499
01:47:28,900 --> 01:47:33,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">who do the things
that no one can imagine.</font>
