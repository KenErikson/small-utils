1
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you watching closely?</font>

2
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:09,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every magic trick consists of three parts, or acts.</font>

3
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">The first part is called "the pledge".</font>

4
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">The magician shows you something ordinary.</font>

5
00:01:16,189 --> 00:01:19,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">A deck of cards, a bird or a man.</font>

6
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">He shows you this object.</font>

7
00:01:28,769 --> 00:01:31,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps he asks you to inspect it,</font>

8
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">to see that it is indeed real,</font>

9
00:01:34,539 --> 00:01:37,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">unaltered, normal.</font>

10
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, of course, it probably isn't.</font>

11
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:46,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where do you think you're going?</font>

12
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm part of the bloody act, you fool.</font>

13
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:03,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">The second act is called "the turn".</font>

14
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">The magician takes the ordinary something</font>

15
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:26,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">and makes it do something extraordinary.</font>

16
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:34,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now you're looking for the secret, but you won't find it,</font>

17
00:02:34,699 --> 00:02:38,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">because, of course, you're not really looking.</font>

18
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:40,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't really want to know.</font>

19
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:45,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to be... fooled.</font>

20
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you wouldn't clap yet,</font>

21
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:54,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">because making something disappear isn't enough.</font>

22
00:02:54,289 --> 00:02:57,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have to bring it back.</font>

23
00:02:59,389 --> 00:03:03,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why every magic trick has a third act.</font>

24
00:03:03,229 --> 00:03:04,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">The hardest part.</font>

25
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">The part we call...</font>

26
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:08,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">". the prestige".</font>

27
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">The prestige? And did Robert Angier, the Great Danton, your employer,</font>

28
00:03:23,949 --> 00:03:26,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">get to that final part of his trick that night?</font>

29
00:03:26,449 --> 00:03:28,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, sir. Something went wrong.
- What went wrong?</font>

30
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:33,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw someone making their way below stage.</font>

31
00:03:33,289 --> 00:03:35,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">I followed him.</font>

32
00:03:35,259 --> 00:03:38,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was Borden, watching Mr. Angier drown.</font>

33
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:42,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you please describe your occupation to the jury, Mr. Cutter.</font>

34
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:44,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm an ing茅nieur, I design illusions</font>

35
00:03:44,539 --> 00:03:47,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">and construct the apparatus necessary for performing them.</font>

36
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:52,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, Mr. Cutter, was this water-filled tank beneath the stage</font>

37
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">part of Mr. Angier's illusion?</font>

38
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:57,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. The tank was brought on for the first trick</font>

39
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:59,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then taken offstage.</font>

40
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">Borden must have placed it under the trap door after the end of it.</font>

41
00:04:03,289 --> 00:04:04,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">How large was this tank?</font>

42
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:07,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a normal tank for escape under water,</font>

43
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">about 400 or 500 gallons.</font>

44
00:04:09,789 --> 00:04:12,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you think he was able to move the tank</font>

45
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">under the trap door without anyone noticing?</font>

46
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a magician, ask him.</font>

47
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">I ask again,</font>

48
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">would this man explain the mechanics of Mr. Angier's illusion.</font>

49
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:25,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Real Transported Man is one of the most sought after illusions</font>

50
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">in this business.</font>

51
00:04:26,379 --> 00:04:27,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have the right to sell it on.</font>

52
00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:30,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I reveal the method here, the trick is worthless.</font>

53
00:04:30,709 --> 00:04:32,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">How can we know that the tank wasn't simply</font>

54
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:35,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">some part of the trick that went wrong?</font>

55
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Cutter, I see your predicament.</font>

56
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">But Alfred Borden's life hangs in the balance.</font>

57
00:04:40,189 --> 00:04:43,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you were prepared to disclose the details to me in private,</font>

58
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:46,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">I might be able to judge their relevance to the case.</font>

59
00:04:46,329 --> 00:04:48,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">Might this be an acceptable compromise?</font>

60
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:10,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to have to ask you to turn out your pockets.</font>

61
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:18,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not my idea, sir. The warden saw his show in Manchester last year</font>

62
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:20,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">where he vanished into thin air.</font>

63
00:05:20,329 --> 00:05:22,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's convinced he'll try and escape.</font>

64
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told him the only way Borden's going to disappear</font>

65
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:31,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">is if I leave him out there with the other inmates.</font>

66
00:05:37,409 --> 00:05:38,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Check the locks...</font>

67
00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:42,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">twice.</font>

68
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:51,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">My name is Owens.</font>

69
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:53,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a solicitor.</font>

70
00:05:54,029 --> 00:05:57,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">I represent Lord Caldlow, an accomplished amateur magician and...</font>

71
00:05:57,769 --> 00:06:00,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">How much?</font>

72
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:02,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He is interested...
- How much for my tricks?</font>

73
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:04,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Five thousand pounds.</font>

74
00:06:04,509 --> 00:06:07,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Talk to Fallon, my ing茅nieur. Money's for him.</font>

75
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:10,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I did. He offered to sell me your tricks.</font>

76
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:13,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">All except the most valuable one, The Transported Man.</font>

77
00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:17,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I won't forgive myself for selling my greatest trick.</font>

78
00:06:17,149 --> 00:06:18,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even for your daughter?</font>

79
00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:24,589
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you are for the drop, your daughter is going to need looking after.</font>

80
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fallon will take care of her.</font>

81
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:28,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perfect, Fallon.</font>

82
00:06:28,269 --> 00:06:30,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">A man with a past as obscure as your own.</font>

83
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:35,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">The courts have motioned she be removed from his care. She will be an orphan.</font>

84
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:37,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you're no stranger to the workhouse.</font>

85
00:06:38,509 --> 00:06:40,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's better than here?</font>

86
00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:43,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm offering you a way to wrap up your affairs with dignity.</font>

87
00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:45,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm offering your daughter a future.</font>

88
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">As Lord Caldlow's ward, she will want for nothing...</font>

89
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:50,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">ever.</font>

90
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, think it over.</font>

91
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:57,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Lord Caldlow would like you to have this,</font>

92
00:06:57,659 --> 00:07:00,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">as a show of good faith. It might be of interest.</font>

93
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:03,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robert Angier's diary, including the time he spent in Colorado</font>

94
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">Iearning your trick.</font>

95
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He never learned it.
- Really?</font>

96
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:10,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">On his return, he mounted a version of The Transported Man</font>

97
00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:14,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">that the papers said was better even than your original.</font>

98
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:15,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you want Angier's secrets,</font>

99
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:21,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">you go dig him up and ask him yourself.</font>

100
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:23,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want your secret, Mr. Borden.</font>

101
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Consider your daughter.</font>

102
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">A cipher,</font>

103
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:39,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">an enigma...</font>

104
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">a search,</font>

105
00:07:43,069 --> 00:07:44,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">a search for answers.</font>

106
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:55,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even if Colorado is the end of my journey,</font>

107
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">it'll take much longer to unravel</font>

108
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:00,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">the rest of Borden's secrets.</font>

109
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:04,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, the cipher in his notebook is</font>

110
00:08:04,899 --> 00:08:07,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">unlocked by a single word,</font>

111
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:10,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it will still take months to translate his writing.</font>

112
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">And to know his mind.</font>

113
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:18,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, my passion is equal to the task.</font>

114
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:35,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Angier, welcome to Colorado Springs.</font>

115
00:08:50,539 --> 00:08:53,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The whole town has electricity.
- Yes, sir.</font>

116
00:09:10,789 --> 00:09:12,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well...</font>

117
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">quite a reception.</font>

118
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:16,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're our first guest of the season, Mr. Angier.</font>

119
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your telegram didn't indicate how long you'd be staying with us.</font>

120
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:21,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">As long as it takes.</font>

121
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:25,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will need a coach tomorrow to take me up the mountain.</font>

122
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:26,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, the peak's closed, sir.</font>

123
00:09:26,909 --> 00:09:28,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">For scientific experimentation.</font>

124
00:09:28,809 --> 00:09:30,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I know.</font>

125
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:32,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why I'm here.</font>

126
00:09:39,389 --> 00:09:41,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa. Whoa.</font>

127
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:46,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll have to walk the rest, I'm afraid, sir.</font>

128
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:25,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm amazed how many of you newspaper writers</font>

129
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">can't read my sign.</font>

130
00:10:31,909 --> 00:10:34,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not the welcome I was expecting.</font>

131
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you.</font>

132
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the Great Danton.</font>

133
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw your show in London.</font>

134
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:50,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seven times you guessed every object</font>

135
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">the audience had in their pockets.</font>

136
00:10:52,629 --> 00:10:56,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Alley. Sorry about the fence. People keep interfering with our work.</font>

137
00:10:56,769 --> 00:10:59,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I've come to see Tesla.
- Why?</font>

138
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:03,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">He made a machine for a colleague of mine some time ago.</font>

139
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:07,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Can you get me a meeting with him?
- Impossible, I'm afraid.</font>

140
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:09,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've brought a lot of money.</font>

141
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:11,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, Mr. Angier.</font>

142
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">I simply can't help.</font>

143
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:19,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll be staying at the hotel, indefinitely.</font>

144
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, what am I holding?</font>

145
00:11:24,629 --> 00:11:25,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your watch.</font>

146
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:34,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Borden's journal entry for April 3,1897,</font>

00:11:52,419 --> 00:11:55,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">is willing to bind this lovely young woman?</font>

154
00:11:56,929 --> 00:11:58,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me!</font>

155
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you would tie her wrists,</font>

156
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">bind her feet...</font>

157
00:12:11,909 --> 00:12:14,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">around the ankle.</font>

158
00:12:14,509 --> 00:12:16,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are either of you two gentlemen sailors?</font>

159
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:18,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- No.</font>

160
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure you can both tie a strong knot.</font>

161
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's complacent, he's predictable, he's boring.</font>

162
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:31,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Milton has gotten success, whatever that means,</font>

163
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:35,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">so now he's scared. He won't take any risks at all.</font>

164
00:13:35,129 --> 00:13:38,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's squandering the goodwill of his audience with tired,</font>

165
00:13:38,259 --> 00:13:40,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">- second-rate tricks...
- They're all favorites.</font>

166
00:13:40,929 --> 00:13:44,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me something fresh. He won't even try a bloody bullet catch.</font>

167
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">A bullet catch is suicide.</font>

168
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">All it takes is some smartass volunteer to put a button in the barrel.</font>

169
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Use a plant.
- You can't for every trick.</font>

170
00:13:52,909 --> 00:13:54,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">No seats left for the punters.</font>

171
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:58,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, no bullet catch, whatever, but the point is a real magician</font>

172
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">tries to invent something new</font>

173
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:03,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">that other magicians will scratch their heads over.</font>

174
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then you sell it to him for a small fortune.</font>

175
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:08,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- I suppose you have such a trick?</font>

176
00:14:08,789 --> 00:14:11,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I sure do.
- Would you care to sell it to me?</font>

177
00:14:11,429 --> 00:14:13,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No one else can do my trick.</font>

178
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Any trick can be duplicated.
- Wrong.</font>

179
00:14:15,299 --> 00:14:19,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">If Mr. Borden has invented his masterpiece,</font>

180
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">he's prepared to do it.</font>

181
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:23,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Milton is a showman, but Borden is right,</font>

182
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:24,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">he won't get his hands dirty.</font>

183
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:28,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you want to see what it takes to make real magic,</font>

184
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:32,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">go to the Tenley. There's a Chinaman there and he really has what it takes.</font>

185
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:34,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Chung Ling Soo.
- I can't afford that.</font>

186
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know the bloke run the door.</font>

187
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:40,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">You two go and see that show, and whichever one of you can tell me</font>

188
00:14:41,019 --> 00:14:44,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">how he does the goldfish bowl trick gets the prize.</font>

189
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Which is?
- Ten minutes onstage</font>

190
00:14:46,529 --> 00:14:48,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">with my old friend, Mr. Ackerman.</font>

191
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:49,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Really?
- Who's Ackerman?</font>

192
00:14:49,929 --> 00:14:52,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">The top theatrical agent in London.</font>

193
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:56,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I saw you drop the knot again.
- I turned my wrists.</font>

194
00:14:56,139 --> 00:14:58,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some nights you just don't get it, do you?</font>

195
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, if that knot slips and Julia's on the hoist,</font>

196
00:15:01,779 --> 00:15:02,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">she'll break her leg.</font>

197
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:04,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the wrong knot.</font>

198
00:15:04,649 --> 00:15:07,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like I said, the Langford double will hold tighter.</font>

199
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:11,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Langford double isn't a wet knot. It's too dangerous.</font>

200
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:13,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">If the rope swells, she can't slip it.</font>

201
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:16,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I can slip a Langford underwater.
- We can practice.</font>

202
00:15:16,789 --> 00:15:20,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Borden, he said no.
- Oh, you know knots better than me?</font>

203
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:22,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, no more mistakes.</font>

204
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:25,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. Yeah? Do you? You want to take over?</font>

205
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:28,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Just leave.
- I didn't think so.</font>

206
00:15:33,009 --> 00:15:34,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Cutter, where's he from?</font>

207
00:15:34,909 --> 00:15:38,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are you from? He shifts props for Virgil at the hall.</font>

208
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:41,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Worried he'll steal your tricks?
- Doesn't deal in methods.</font>

209
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How do you know?
- Because I hired him</font>

210
00:15:44,649 --> 00:15:47,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">to find out how Virgil does the orange trick.</font>

211
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I don't trust him.
- He's a natural magician.</font>

212
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Course you can't trust him.</font>

213
00:15:52,529 --> 00:15:53,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think he's all right.</font>

214
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You think everyone's all right.
- Even you.</font>

215
00:15:56,370 --> 00:16:00,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Watch your sightlines. If I can see you kiss your wife's leg every night,</font>

216
00:16:00,269 --> 00:16:02,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">so can the blokes at the ends of rows three and four!</font>

217
00:16:35,009 --> 00:16:37,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're wrong. It can't be.</font>

218
00:16:37,509 --> 00:16:41,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Look at the man.
- This is the trick.</font>

219
00:16:41,309 --> 00:16:43,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the performance. Right here.</font>

220
00:16:43,409 --> 00:16:45,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is why no one can detect his method.</font>

221
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:49,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Total devotion to his art.</font>

222
00:16:50,149 --> 00:16:51,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">A lot of self-sacrifice.</font>

223
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know.</font>

224
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:57,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the only way to escape...</font>

225
00:16:57,159 --> 00:16:59,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">all this, you know?</font>

226
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:07,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can barely lift this thing and it's not even filled with water.</font>

227
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:11,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or fish, look.</font>

228
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:13,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know. Hang on a second.</font>

229
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:18,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">He must be strong as an ox.</font>

230
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:23,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's been pretending to be a cripple for years.</font>

231
00:17:23,549 --> 00:17:27,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any time he's in public, any time he goes out. It's unthinkable.</font>

232
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:30,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">Borden saw it at once. But I couldn't fathom it.</font>

233
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:33,089
<font color="#FFFFFF">Living my whole life pretending to be someone else.</font>

234
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are pretending.</font>

235
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think changing a name compares.</font>

236
00:17:37,069 --> 00:17:39,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not your name. Who you are and where you're from.</font>

237
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:43,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">I promised I wouldn't embarrass my family with my theatrical endeavors.</font>

238
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:47,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought of a name for you.</font>

239
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:52,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Great Danton.</font>

240
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:55,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you like it? But it's sophisticated.</font>

241
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:56,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's French.</font>

242
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:06,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Borden writes as if no one but he understood the true nature of magic.</font>

243
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:15,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">But what does he know of self-sacrifice?</font>

244
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">You bloody fool.</font>

245
00:18:50,069 --> 00:18:53,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He killed it.
- It's OK.</font>

246
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:57,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He killed it.
- He didn't.</font>

247
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:03,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, now he'll bring it back.</font>

248
00:19:05,589 --> 00:19:08,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, he killed it.
- No, he didn't.</font>

249
00:19:16,829 --> 00:19:19,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, see, he's all right. He's fine.</font>

250
00:19:19,869 --> 00:19:23,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Look at him.
- But where's his brother?</font>

251
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a sharp lad, your son.</font>

252
00:19:30,009 --> 00:19:32,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, he's my nephew.</font>

253
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah.</font>

254
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the lucky one today.</font>

255
00:20:00,509 --> 00:20:03,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you watching closely?</font>

256
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:07,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look closer.</font>

257
00:20:11,019 --> 00:20:12,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never show anyone.</font>

258
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:15,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'll beg you and flatter you for the secret,</font>

259
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:19,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">but as soon as you give it up, you'll be nothing to them.</font>

260
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:21,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">You understand? Nothing.</font>

261
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:24,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">The secret impresses no one.</font>

262
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:28,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">The trick you use it for is everything.</font>

263
00:20:32,579 --> 00:20:35,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, thank you for lunch, Mr. Borden.</font>

264
00:20:35,579 --> 00:20:37,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're welcome.</font>

265
00:20:38,509 --> 00:20:40,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alfred, it's Alfred.</font>

266
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alfred.</font>

267
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I could use a cup of tea.</font>

268
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:48,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't allow... It's the landlord. It's not...</font>

269
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:53,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think that's... Is that enough to keep me out?</font>

270
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:56,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think so.</font>

271
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:59,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I'll see you again?</font>

272
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:10,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Milk and sugar?</font>

273
00:21:31,869 --> 00:21:33,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's in there?</font>

274
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">Angier's machine.</font>

275
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:46,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">You built this, Mr. Cutter?</font>

276
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:48,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no, sir. This wasn't built by a magician.</font>

277
00:21:49,049 --> 00:21:51,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">This was built by a wizard.</font>

278
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:56,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">A man who can actually do what magicians pretend to do.</font>

279
00:21:56,230 --> 00:22:00,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me, Your Honor, what happens with these things after the trial?</font>

280
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">They've been sold to a Lord Caldlow.</font>

281
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:05,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">An avid collector, very interested in the case.</font>

282
00:22:05,369 --> 00:22:07,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Well, don't let him take this.</font>

283
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:10,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why ever not?
- It's too dangerous.</font>

284
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:12,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure beneath its bells and whistles</font>

285
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's got a simple and disappointing trick.</font>

286
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:17,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">The most disappointing of all, sir.</font>

287
00:22:20,019 --> 00:22:21,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">It has no trick.</font>

288
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:25,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's real.</font>

289
00:22:28,859 --> 00:22:31,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the tank Angier drowned in?</font>

290
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:33,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

291
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:35,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the...</font>

292
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:38,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">place where the performer's hand reaches through</font>

293
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">to the trick padlock.</font>

294
00:22:40,069 --> 00:22:42,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">A standard magical apparatus for escapes?</font>

295
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:44,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, with one important difference.</font>

296
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:47,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">This isn't a trick lock.</font>

297
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:49,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's been switched for a real one.</font>

298
00:22:49,109 --> 00:22:51,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">What a way to kill someone.</font>

299
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:53,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're magicians, Your Honor.</font>

300
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:59,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">Showmen, men who live by dressing up plain and sometimes brutal truths,</font>

301
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">to amaze, to shock.</font>

302
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even without an audience?</font>

303
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">There was an audience.</font>

304
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see, this water tank</font>

305
00:23:10,829 --> 00:23:14,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">was of particular significance to these two men.</font>

306
00:23:15,569 --> 00:23:18,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Particularly awful significance.</font>

307
00:23:21,009 --> 00:23:26,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which of you brave souls is willing to bind this lovely young woman?</font>

308
00:23:28,579 --> 00:23:30,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you would tie her wrists,</font>

309
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:32,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">bind her feet around the ankle.</font>

310
00:23:45,539 --> 00:23:48,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are either of you gentlemen sailors?
- No.</font>

311
00:23:50,109 --> 00:23:52,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure you can both tie a strong knot.</font>

312
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robert!</font>

313
00:25:10,849 --> 00:25:12,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no.</font>

314
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:18,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Julia. Julia!</font>

315
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew an old sailor once.</font>

316
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:09,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">They told me he went overboard,</font>

317
00:26:09,349 --> 00:26:11,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">tangled in the sails.</font>

318
00:26:11,509 --> 00:26:13,309

00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:17,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it took him five minutes to cough.</font>

320
00:26:17,349 --> 00:26:19,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said it was like...</font>

321
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">going home.</font>

322
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:28,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you want, Borden?</font>

323
00:26:35,769 --> 00:26:37,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry for your loss, Angier.</font>

324
00:26:41,609 --> 00:26:43,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which knot did you tie?</font>

325
00:26:46,819 --> 00:26:49,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">I keep asking myself that.</font>

326
00:26:49,819 --> 00:26:51,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And?
- And...</font>

327
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:56,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, I just don't know.</font>

328

330
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:07,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't know?</font>

331
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:13,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't know?</font>

332
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:22,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Alfred?
- Good news. We got our first booking.</font>

333
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think we've had the pleasure.</font>

334
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:28,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mr. Fallon is my ing茅nieur.
- Where did you get all...?</font>

335
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:32,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I had to borrow and... don't ask.
- He's a very enterprising soul</font>

336
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">is... is Mr. Fallon. So...</font>

337
00:27:34,259 --> 00:27:37,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We can't afford to pay him.
- The money will come with the audience.</font>

338
00:27:37,769 --> 00:27:41,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">But what about until then? What I earn, it's barely enough for us.</font>

339
00:27:41,539 --> 00:27:45,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry about it. I'll share half my food with him or something.</font>

340
00:27:45,569 --> 00:27:48,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're going to be doing that with someone else.</font>

341
00:27:48,609 --> 00:27:50,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. You're...</font>

342
00:27:50,579 --> 00:27:52,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">Having a baby.</font>

343
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

344
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:58,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should have told Fallon. That is great.</font>

345
00:27:58,789 --> 00:28:01,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, come here.</font>

346
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:04,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

347
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:05,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alfred, what is this?</font>

348
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:10,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, this is just the trick to work Ackerman up at the end of my act.</font>

349
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it the masterpiece, the great trick?</font>

350
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:15,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no, the world is not ready for that one yet.</font>

351
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:20,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is just your run-of-the-mill, daring, spectacular bullet catch.</font>

352
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:22,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">- A bullet catch.
- Yeah, but it's safe.</font>

353
00:28:22,809 --> 00:28:25,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">I promise. Look.</font>

354
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Shoot me.
- Shoot you?</font>

355
00:28:29,819 --> 00:28:31,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on, shoot me.</font>

356
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:35,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Right there.
- No, I can't.</font>

357
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:38,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, not there. Shoot me here. Don't...</font>

358
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:45,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">How's that?</font>

359
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's very good. Tell me how you do it.</font>

360
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:49,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I can't do that.</font>

361
00:28:52,009 --> 00:28:54,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, then you can't do it.
- I can't do it?</font>

362
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:58,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, but I can't raise a child on my own.</font>

363
00:28:58,349 --> 00:29:00,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't tell anybody that I told you.</font>

364
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:03,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">- OK.
- Gunpowder.</font>

365
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:06,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wadding.</font>

366
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:10,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then the bullet.</font>

367
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:12,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ramrod.</font>

368
00:29:17,569 --> 00:29:19,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold out your hand.</font>

369
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:25,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">The bullet is not even in the gun when the charge is fired.</font>

370
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:29,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once you know, it's actually very obvious.</font>

371
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I mean, you still get...</font>

372
00:29:32,549 --> 00:29:34,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's dangerous.</font>

373
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:36,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">- People still get killed doing that.
- How?</font>

374
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:39,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">You get some smartass who could put a penny or a button</font>

375
00:29:39,289 --> 00:29:42,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">or, God forbid, Sarah, somebody could put a bullet down there.</font>

376
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:45,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry. Don't worry,</font>

377
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:49,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">because I'm not gonna let anything happen.</font>

378
00:29:49,299 --> 00:29:52,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything's gonna be all right because...</font>

379
00:29:53,539 --> 00:29:56,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love you very much.</font>

380
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Say it again.
- I love you.</font>

381
00:30:03,809 --> 00:30:06,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Not today.
- What?</font>

382
00:30:06,349 --> 00:30:09,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, some days it's not true, and today you don't mean it.</font>

383
00:30:09,589 --> 00:30:12,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe today you're more in love with magic than me.</font>

384
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:15,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like being able to tell the difference.</font>

385
00:30:15,589 --> 00:30:18,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">It makes the days it is true</font>

386
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:20,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">mean something.</font>

387
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:23,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

388
00:30:42,849 --> 00:30:46,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Metal rings, ladies and gentlemen.</font>

389
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">If there are any ladies and gentlemen here.</font>

390
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Solid metal.
- Seen that already.</font>

391
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:04,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who threw that?</font>

392
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is what you came for, is it?</font>

393
00:31:26,299 --> 00:31:27,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">So...</font>

394
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">who wants to volunteer?</font>

395
00:31:30,869 --> 00:31:32,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I do!
- Me!</font>

396
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me.</font>

397
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:45,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me.</font>

398
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:01,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you man enough, sir?</font>

399
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:08,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

400
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:20,839
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which knot did you tie, Borden?</font>

401
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:29,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which knot did you tie, Borden?</font>

402
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

403
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:51,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">He came in to demand an answer, and I told him the truth.</font>

404
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">That I have fought with myself over that night,</font>

405
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">one half of me swearing blind that I tied a simple slipknot,</font>

406
00:32:58,119 --> 00:33:01,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">the other half convinced that I tied the Langford double.</font>

407
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:03,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can never know for sure.</font>

408
00:33:06,529 --> 00:33:08,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">How can he not know!</font>

409
00:33:08,859 --> 00:33:10,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">How can he not know?</font>

410
00:33:12,269 --> 00:33:14,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">He must know what he did.</font>

411
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:16,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">He must.</font>

412
00:33:18,869 --> 00:33:20,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sarah, that bloody hurts.</font>

413
00:33:21,579 --> 00:33:24,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't understand how it can be bleeding again.</font>

414
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:26,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's as bad as the day it happened.</font>

415
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:32,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We have to get a doctor back.
- We can't afford the doctor back.</font>

416
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:37,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You've woken her.
- Great.</font>

417
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:40,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, I need this to heal so I can get back to work.</font>

418
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:44,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've got to face things. What tricks can you perform with this injury?</font>

419
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:47,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can do car pulls. I can do some prop tricks.</font>

420
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:52,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can still do that. I can do the trick I've been telling you about.</font>

421
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:54,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">The one that they're gonna remember me for.</font>

422
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

423
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:27,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never thought I'd find an answer at the bottom of a pint glass.</font>

424
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hasn't stopped your looking.</font>

425
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:37,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heard about a booking. Nice little theater.</font>

426
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:39,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Young, up-and-coming magician.
- Who?</font>

427
00:34:39,989 --> 00:34:42,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You.
- Me? Booking? Why?</font>

428
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:44,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to keep on working.</font>

429
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's going to hire the ing茅nieur that killed Julia McCullough</font>

430
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:50,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">in front of a sellout crowd at the Orpheum?</font>

431
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:53,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone who knows it wasn't your fault.</font>

432
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone who knows Alfred Borden and his repertoire of exotic knots.</font>

433
00:34:57,010 --> 00:35:00,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hear he had a spot of bad luck catching a bullet south of the river.</font>

434
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:03,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a dangerous trick, that one.</font>

435
00:35:08,619 --> 00:35:10,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll have to whitewash the windows,</font>

436
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:14,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">confound the more curious members of the public, but it will do.</font>

437
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:19,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We should see about an assistant.
- I've made some arrangements.</font>

438
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:22,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">You settled on a name?</font>

439
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I have.</font>

440
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:27,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Great Danton.</font>

441
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:29,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a bit old-fashioned, isn't it?</font>

442
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:33,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it's sophisticated.</font>

443
00:35:33,309 --> 00:35:36,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">The birdcage can't be our climax. Everybody knows it.</font>

444
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:38,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Not like this.
- I don't want to kill doves.</font>

445
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:40,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then stay off the stage.</font>

446
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:42,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a magician, not a wizard.</font>

447

<font color="#FFFFFF">You got to get your hands dirty, if you're going to achieve the impossible.</font>

448
00:35:47,659 --> 00:35:50,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">In here, Miss Wenscombe.</font>

449

<font color="#FFFFFF">No point in meeting Mr. Angier if you don't fit. On the right.</font>

00:35:57,730 --> 00:35:59,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's so hard about this?
- Nothing.</font>

451
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:02,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're going... down here.</font>

452
00:36:08,179 --> 00:36:11,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And this will conceal, right?
- Oh, sure.</font>

453
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:13,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Tighten up on there.
- Yep.</font>

454
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">OK.</font>

455
00:36:16,519 --> 00:36:17,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">This ties up here?</font>

456
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:19,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ties in the back.
- Good.</font>

457
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:27,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Breathe as little as possible.</font>

458
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, you see?</font>

459
00:36:36,539 --> 00:36:37,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's it.
- OK.</font>

460
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:43,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's not experienced,</font>

461
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">but she knows how to present herself.</font>

462
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:49,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">A pretty assistant is the most effective form of misdirection.</font>

463
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:53,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, for my final trick,</font>

464
00:36:53,489 --> 00:36:56,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will require the assistance of two volunteers.</font>

465
00:36:56,329 --> 00:36:58,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Merrit, if you would oblige me?</font>

466
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yep.</font>

467
00:37:03,829 --> 00:37:05,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Under?
- Under, yeah.</font>

468
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:08,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come around his foot.</font>

469
00:37:08,469 --> 00:37:09,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Careful.
- It's all right.</font>

470
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Your volunteer, put their hand there.
- Yeah?</font>

471
00:37:33,099 --> 00:37:34,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">And another one here.</font>

472
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you'll place your hands on either side of the cage, please.</font>

473
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:39,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, Olivia.</font>

474
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">You best not be intending to hurt this animal, Mr. Angier.</font>

475
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Of course not.
- Ready? Right.</font>

476
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:49,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">- One...
- Two...</font>

477
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:51,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three.</font>

478
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's bloody marvelous, Cutter.</font>

479
00:37:58,590 --> 00:37:59,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very nice.</font>

480
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the best part is...</font>

481
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:09,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you said I had to get my hands dirty.</font>

482
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:11,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someday, perhaps you will.</font>

483
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just had to know that you can.</font>

484
00:38:13,139 --> 00:38:15,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very nice. Very nice, indeed.</font>

485
00:38:15,139 --> 00:38:18,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">I haven't had the chance to compliment you on your beautiful theater.</font>

486
00:38:18,869 --> 00:38:21,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">It'll be a lot more beautiful when it's full.</font>

487
00:38:21,309 --> 00:38:22,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry.</font>

488
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">You all say that. Why should I worry?</font>

489
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:27,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">If your tricks don't get them in, somebody else's will.</font>

490
00:38:27,619 --> 00:38:31,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe somebody willing to do a bullet catch or a water escape?</font>

491
00:38:31,789 --> 00:38:33,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cheap thrills, Mr. Merrit.</font>

492
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:37,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">People hoping for an accident, likely to see one too.</font>

493
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:39,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">What would that do for your business?</font>

494
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:42,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got a week, John.</font>

495
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:45,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, Mr. Merrit.</font>

496
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:54,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

497
00:38:56,679 --> 00:39:00,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh... Sir, in the third row there.</font>

498
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:03,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please stand up and show us your handkerchief.</font>

499
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:06,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">This isn't mine.</font>

500
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps you'd return it to the lady in the aisle of the second row.</font>

501
00:39:10,489 --> 00:39:12,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe she has yours.</font>

502
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:23,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm making so many mistakes. I'm so nervous.</font>

503
00:39:23,869 --> 00:39:26,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">The audience doesn't seem to be responding.</font>

504
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:28,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">They've seen a lot of tricks before,</font>

505
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:31,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">but not this next one.</font>

506
00:39:40,059 --> 00:39:41,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cloth over.</font>

507
00:39:41,889 --> 00:39:43,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep your fingers crossed.</font>

508
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:45,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll have the champagne ready.</font>

509
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You've seen this one before?
- We've seen them all before.</font>

510
00:40:03,849 --> 00:40:05,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll make it a little harder then, shall I?</font>

511
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:09,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two volunteers, please. A lady and a gentlemen.</font>

512
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:12,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">To hold this cage with me.</font>

513
00:40:12,349 --> 00:40:14,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll perform this feat in a manner</font>

514
00:40:14,389 --> 00:40:18,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">never before seen by yourselves or any other audience anywhere in the world.</font>

515
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Madame, place one hand on the back of the cage,</font>

516
00:40:24,099 --> 00:40:25,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">one hand on the front.</font>

517
00:40:25,699 --> 00:40:28,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir, one hand on the bottom of the cage</font>

518
00:40:28,139 --> 00:40:29,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">one hand on the top.</font>

519
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:45,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I should've spotted him.
- You had a lot of plates going.</font>

520
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:48,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Don't suppose we can do this again.
- No.</font>

521
00:40:48,219 --> 00:40:50,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So, what's the climax of our show?
- Show?</font>

522
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:53,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You don't have a show.
- We have a week's engagement.</font>

523
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">To perform magic, not butcher birds and break my customers' fingers.</font>

524
00:40:57,590 --> 00:41:00,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clear out, anything here in the morning gets burned.</font>

525
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mr. Merrit...
- It's done, John.</font>

526
00:41:02,869 --> 00:41:05,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've hired a comedian. You know I hate comedians.</font>

527
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, there's plenty of good theaters.</font>

528
00:41:10,369 --> 00:41:13,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we can come up with a new trick,</font>

529
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">- change the name of the act.
- The name stays.</font>

530
00:41:18,349 --> 00:41:23,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right, well, then the new trick's gonna have to be irresistible then.</font>

531
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:25,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a couple of methods to try out.</font>

532
00:41:25,659 --> 00:41:28,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then we need a new angle on the presentation.</font>

533
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if you need some inspiration,</font>

534
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:34,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">there's a technical exposition at the Albert Hall this week.</font>

535
00:41:34,099 --> 00:41:36,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Engineers, scientists, you know?</font>

536
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:40,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">That sort of thing captures the public's imagination.</font>

537
00:41:57,250 --> 00:42:00,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mind if I join you? Tesla sends me down here during the storms.</font>

538
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:03,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perfect excuse to come join the Great Danton for a drink.</font>

539
00:42:04,929 --> 00:42:07,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two of them.</font>

540
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:10,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Beautiful, isn't it? God, I miss New York, though.</font>

541
00:42:10,099 --> 00:42:12,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why are you here?
- The lightning lives here.</font>

542
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:14,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">And not much else.</font>

543
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:15,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our work is secret.</font>

544
00:42:16,469 --> 00:42:18,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">That a cipher?</font>

545
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">A rotating transposition that shifts every day of the diary.</font>

546
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:27,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Simple but time-consuming to translate, even with the five-letter keyword.</font>

547
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:29,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which is?</font>

548
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:31,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">We magicians have a circle of trust.</font>

549
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:35,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have a circle of trust with someone whose diary you stole?</font>

550
00:42:35,789 --> 00:42:37,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe I bought it.</font>

551
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:40,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you're hoping to find a great secret in there?</font>

552
00:42:40,429 --> 00:42:42,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've already found it.</font>

553
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why I'm here.</font>

554
00:42:50,409 --> 00:42:53,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tesla built one for another magician.</font>

555
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:54,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would you want the same thing?</font>

556
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:56,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Call it a professional rivalry.</font>

557
00:42:57,010 --> 00:43:01,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Tesla has built unusual machines for unusual people.</font>

558
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:05,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But he would never talk about it.
- I understand discretion.</font>

559
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just want the machine.</font>

560
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Finish your drink.</font>

561
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:15,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to show you something. I think you'll have</font>

562
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:17,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">a special appreciation for our work.</font>

563
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:21,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I thought it was a secret.
- You're a magician.</font>

564
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:22,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's gonna believe you?</font>

565
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:26,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not long now.</font>

566
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:28,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our equipment requires a great deal of current.</font>

567
00:43:28,909 --> 00:43:30,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tesla electrified the whole town</font>

568
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:33,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">in exchange for using the generators when we need them.</font>

569
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:38,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">We do our tests when the townspeople are asleep.</font>

570
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:40,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Tesla doesn't want to scare anyone.</font>

571
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:00,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are the wires?</font>

572
00:44:02,179 --> 00:44:03,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Exactly.</font>

573
00:44:12,659 --> 00:44:15,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's the generator?</font>

574
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:16,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">You saw it last week.</font>

575
00:44:16,929 --> 00:44:20,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That must be ten miles from here.
- Fifteen.</font>

576
00:44:20,099 --> 00:44:24,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I have to ride all of them before I get to bed.</font>

577
00:44:24,269 --> 00:44:26,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll send word for you in a few days, Mr. Angier.</font>

578
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:31,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Magic. Real magic.</font>

579
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:33,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now appearing, only here at London's Royal Albert Hall,</font>

580
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:37,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">one of the miracles of our age.</font>

581
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:42,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">A technological marvel. You've never seen anything like it in your lives.</font>

582
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:45,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your eyes will not believe what they're witnessing.</font>

583
00:44:45,219 --> 00:44:48,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">The miracle of Nikola Tesla, ladies and gentlemen.</font>

584
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:50,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Free, clean power. Like to know the future?</font>

585
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:53,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">The man who's speaking right now is going to change the world.</font>

586
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:58,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come one, come all. Immediate seating, no waiting.</font>

587
00:45:13,349 --> 00:45:14,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ladies and gentlemen,</font>

588
00:45:16,690 --> 00:45:18,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">objections have been raised...</font>

589
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:22,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">They should be raised. Does that look safe to you?</font>

590
00:45:22,090 --> 00:45:24,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Part of Thomas Edison's smear campaign</font>

591
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:30,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">against Mr. Tesla's superior alternating current.</font>

592
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:33,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have asked Mr. Tesla to reconsider.</font>

593
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which he will not!</font>

594
00:45:35,969 --> 00:45:41,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I've been told he refuses to appear under any such restrictions.</font>

595
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:43,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">This thing's gonna blow.</font>

596
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:47,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ladies and gentlemen, please.</font>

597
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:27,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

598
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:32,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Jess.</font>

599
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:38,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you had a nice day with mommy? Huh?</font>

600
00:46:39,269 --> 00:46:41,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sarah.</font>

601
00:46:41,369 --> 00:46:44,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I love you.
- See, today it's true.</font>

602
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:46,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah.
- Hello.</font>

603
00:46:48,809 --> 00:46:51,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw happiness.</font>

604
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:53,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Happiness that should have been mine.</font>

605
00:46:53,949 --> 00:46:55,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I was wrong.</font>

606
00:46:56,050 --> 00:47:00,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">His notebook reveals that he never had the life that I envied.</font>

607
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:03,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">The family life that he craves one minute,</font>

608
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:07,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">he rails against the next, demanding freedom.</font>

609
00:47:07,829 --> 00:47:10,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">His mind... his mind is a divided one.</font>

610
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:12,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">His soul is restless.</font>

611
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">His wife and child, tormented</font>

612
00:47:14,599 --> 00:47:18,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">by his fickle and contradictory nature.</font>

613
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:25,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, what do you think you'll call her?</font>

614
00:47:25,349 --> 00:47:26,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

615
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:29,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody needs a name, so, what's hers?</font>

616
00:47:29,989 --> 00:47:31,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe Sarah.</font>

617
00:47:34,159 --> 00:47:36,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a lovely name. That's a lovely name.</font>

618
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:39,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you talk about what you want to do for the rest of the day.</font>

619
00:47:39,929 --> 00:47:41,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, go on, you talk with her.</font>

620
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:48,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are they taking her away?</font>

621
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:50,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">To the workhouse?</font>

622
00:47:53,309 --> 00:47:54,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">You keep talking.</font>

623
00:47:57,510 --> 00:47:59,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell Owens I've reconsidered. Take it.</font>

624
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:01,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on, take it.</font>

625
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:07,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's for the best.</font>

626
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:14,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me see.</font>

627
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna learn all the professor's secrets.</font>

628
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:21,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only if I teach you how to read.</font>

629
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:23,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're just stupid tricks, right?</font>

630
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:26,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Haven't helped you get out of here, have they?</font>

631
00:48:26,909 --> 00:48:30,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or can't you undo real locks, professor?</font>

632
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:34,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe I'm just biding my time.</font>

633
00:48:34,349 --> 00:48:36,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe one day I'll...</font>

634
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:39,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">open my hand, get your attention,</font>

635
00:48:39,619 --> 00:48:42,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">ask, "Are you watching closely?"</font>

636
00:48:42,590 --> 00:48:44,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe a magic whirl or two.</font>

637
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:49,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then I'll be gone.</font>

638
00:48:52,739 --> 00:48:55,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">How'd you get so famous then?</font>

639
00:48:56,710 --> 00:48:58,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">Magic.</font>

640
00:49:00,909 --> 00:49:03,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oi! Borden, get back here!</font>

641
00:49:03,849 --> 00:49:05,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

642
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:07,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut up!</font>

643
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:12,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's the bloody key?</font>

644
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:21,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">February 8,1899.</font>

645
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Today, finally, a breakthrough.</font>

646
00:49:24,199 --> 00:49:26,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tesla's agreed to see me.</font>

647
00:49:34,679 --> 00:49:35,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perfectly safe.</font>

648
00:49:57,369 --> 00:50:01,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">So this is the Great Danton.</font>

649
00:50:01,199 --> 00:50:05,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Alley has effused about your act to me on any number of occasions.</font>

650
00:50:07,639 --> 00:50:09,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold out other hand.</font>

651
00:50:17,789 --> 00:50:21,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's conducting the electricity?
- Our bodies, Mr. Angier.</font>

652
00:50:21,659 --> 00:50:25,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quite capable of conducting and, indeed, producing energy.</font>

653
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you eaten, Mr. Angier?</font>

654
00:50:31,369 --> 00:50:34,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need something impossible.</font>

655
00:50:36,309 --> 00:50:41,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're familiar with the phrase, "Man's reach exceeds his grasp"?</font>

656
00:50:41,139 --> 00:50:42,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is a lie.</font>

657
00:50:42,909 --> 00:50:44,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Man's grasp exceeds his nerve.</font>

658
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:49,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Society only tolerates one change at a time.</font>

659
00:50:50,489 --> 00:50:53,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">First time I tried to change the world,</font>

660
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:55,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was hailed as a visionary.</font>

661
00:50:56,090 --> 00:50:58,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">Second time...</font>

662
00:50:58,289 --> 00:51:01,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was asked politely to retire.</font>

663
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:05,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">So here I am, enjoying my retirement.</font>

664
00:51:06,070 --> 00:51:09,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing is impossible, Mr. Angier. What you want is simply expensive.</font>

665
00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:12,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I were to build for you this machine,</font>

666
00:51:12,309 --> 00:51:15,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">you would be presenting it merely as illusion?</font>

667
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, if people actually believed the things I did on stage,</font>

668
00:51:18,849 --> 00:51:21,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">they wouldn't clap, they'd scream.</font>

669
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:23,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Think of sawing a woman in half.</font>

670
00:51:23,389 --> 00:51:25,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you considered the cost of this?</font>

671
00:51:25,789 --> 00:51:27,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Price is not an object.</font>

672
00:51:27,789 --> 00:51:31,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps not, but have you considered the cost?</font>

673
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:34,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not sure I follow.</font>

674
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:36,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go home, forget this thing.</font>

675
00:51:37,030 --> 00:51:39,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can recognize an obsession.</font>

676
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:43,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No good will come of it.
- Hasn't good come of your obsessions?</font>

677
00:51:43,409 --> 00:51:46,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">At first, but I have followed them too long.</font>

678
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:48,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am their slave.</font>

679
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:51,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">And one day, they will choose to destroy me.</font>

680
00:51:53,619 --> 00:51:58,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you understand an obsession, then you know you won't change my mind.</font>

681
00:51:58,989 --> 00:51:59,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">So be it.</font>

682
00:52:01,489 --> 00:52:02,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you build it?</font>

683
00:52:03,789 --> 00:52:07,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've already begun to build it, Mr. Angier.</font>

684
00:52:07,429 --> 00:52:11,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope you enjoy the mountain air. This will take some time.</font>

685
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:38,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh... I thought you'd gone.</font>

686
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:41,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't really have anywhere to go.</font>

687
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:45,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've been sleeping here?</font>

688
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:50,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cutter said it'd be all right till we get another booking. What are you doing?</font>

689
00:52:50,409 --> 00:52:52,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh... research.</font>

690
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:54,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Part of a magician's job</font>

691
00:52:54,210 --> 00:52:57,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">is to... watch his competition, see what illusions...</font>

692
00:52:57,150 --> 00:53:00,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're going to do something to that man, aren't you?</font>

693
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:02,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cutter's hoping you let things lie.</font>

694
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:04,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">He says if Borden thinks things are even between you...</font>

695
00:53:05,019 --> 00:53:06,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even?</font>

696
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:09,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">My wife for a couple of his fingers?</font>

697
00:53:09,559 --> 00:53:12,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">He has a family now and he's performing again.</font>

698
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:15,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Borden is out there living his life just as he intended,</font>

699
00:53:15,630 --> 00:53:18,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">as if nothing had happened and look at me.</font>

700
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm alone and no theater will touch me.</font>

701
00:53:20,969 --> 00:53:22,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Us.</font>

702
00:53:22,639 --> 00:53:25,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're going to need a better disguise.</font>

703
00:53:42,519 --> 00:53:44,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need a volunteer.</font>

704
00:53:44,789 --> 00:53:46,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened?</font>

705
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:49,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you hurt him?</font>

706
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened, Robert?</font>

707
00:53:54,699 --> 00:53:58,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">You, sir. Just a rubber ball, yes?</font>

708
00:53:58,739 --> 00:53:59,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

709
00:53:59,909 --> 00:54:02,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just a rubber ball? No.</font>

710
00:54:02,579 --> 00:54:05,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not normal. Not a normal rubber ball.</font>

711
00:54:05,849 --> 00:54:06,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's magic.</font>

712
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:09,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">He had a new trick.</font>

713
00:54:23,869 --> 00:54:25,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was it good?</font>

714
00:54:28,909 --> 00:54:33,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was the greatest magic trick I've ever seen.</font>

715
00:54:37,679 --> 00:54:38,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did they applaud when you saw it?</font>

716
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:43,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was too good. It was too simple. The audience hardly had time to see it.</font>

717
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:46,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He's a dreadful magician.
- A wonderful magician.</font>

718
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:49,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a dreadful showman. He doesn't dress it up,</font>

719
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">- how to sell it.
- How does he do it?</font>

720
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:53,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He uses a double.
- No, it's too simple.</font>

721
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:54,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a complex illusion.</font>

722
00:54:54,929 --> 00:54:57,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">You say that because you don't know the method.</font>

723
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:59,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a double that comes out. It's the only way.</font>

724
00:54:59,869 --> 00:55:03,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've seen him perform it three times. The prestige is the same man.</font>

725
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:07,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, it's not.
- The same man comes out of the cabinet.</font>

726
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the same man.</font>

727
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:12,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wears padded gloves to hide his damaged fingers,</font>

728
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:15,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">but, if you look closely, you can tell.</font>

729
00:55:16,849 --> 00:55:19,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">He doesn't know how to sell it to an audience, but I do.</font>

730
00:55:19,789 --> 00:55:22,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, we could use it as a climax to the show.</font>

731
00:55:22,289 --> 00:55:24,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

732
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:27,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">The man stole my life, I'm gonna steal his trick.</font>

733
00:55:28,030 --> 00:55:30,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got to find someone who looks like you.</font>

734
00:55:30,269 --> 00:55:33,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He doesn't use a double.
- I don't know how Borden does it.</font>

735
00:55:33,869 --> 00:55:38,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Either... You either wait for him to retire and buy the secret,</font>

736
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:40,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">or you listen to how I would do it.</font>

737
00:55:40,309 --> 00:55:42,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the only way that I know how to do it</font>

738
00:55:42,909 --> 00:55:45,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">is to find you a bloody good double.</font>

739
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:47,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

740
00:55:49,219 --> 00:55:51,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take a good look. Let's get out there and find me.</font>

741
00:55:51,789 --> 00:55:53,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoo!</font>

742
00:55:53,989 --> 00:55:55,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, look.</font>

743
00:56:00,030 --> 00:56:01,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's that?</font>

744
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:07,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's for you.
- What's this for?</font>

745
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:09,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come.</font>

746
00:56:11,909 --> 00:56:14,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">You...</font>

747
00:56:14,639 --> 00:56:18,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I asked you last week...
- You caught me in a wrong mood.</font>

748
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:20,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But you won't ever...
- Sarah,</font>

749
00:56:21,019 --> 00:56:24,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna have to change my mind, aren't I?</font>

750
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:28,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">The act is taking off. Soon we'll be in a bigger theater, things will work out.</font>

751
00:56:31,489 --> 00:56:35,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't believe it. Thank you. Thank you. It's beautiful.</font>

752
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:45,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Gerry?
- Darling, look at you.</font>

753
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:48,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Cutter, Mr. Angier, I'd like you to meet Gerald Root.</font>

754
00:56:48,139 --> 00:56:50,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hm.</font>

755
00:56:53,150 --> 00:56:57,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">A pleasure. Pleasure to meet you fine gentlemen.</font>

756
00:56:57,150 --> 00:57:00,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you like for me to tell you a little joke? Come here.</font>

757
00:57:03,929 --> 00:57:07,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. Are you laughing now?</font>

758
00:57:10,469 --> 00:57:12,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to take a piss.</font>

759
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:16,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He's out of his mind.
- Of course, he's an out-of-work actor.</font>

760
00:57:16,670 --> 00:57:18,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's perfect. He needs a little help.</font>

761
00:57:18,639 --> 00:57:21,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">But when I get done with him, he could be your brother.</font>

762
00:57:21,679 --> 00:57:24,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't need him to be my brother, I need him to be me.</font>

763
00:57:24,349 --> 00:57:26,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me a month.</font>

764
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:35,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you open the door...</font>

765
00:57:35,519 --> 00:57:36,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">and...</font>

766
00:57:44,369 --> 00:57:46,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

767
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:51,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Couldn't you have found a softer one?</font>

768
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:54,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it's not for sleeping on.</font>

769
00:57:54,239 --> 00:57:56,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, if you come down through there...</font>

770
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:02,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">- ... does Root go up through there?
- Yep.</font>

771
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:04,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's going to be amazing.</font>

772
00:58:04,219 --> 00:58:07,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it has to be. Borden's trick is getting noticed.</font>

773
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:12,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">The place was packed today.</font>

774
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:16,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">You went and saw his show again.</font>

775
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:18,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ready to meet yourself, Mr. Angier?</font>

776
00:58:27,179 --> 00:58:29,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">All I have to do is keep myself stinking drunk,</font>

777
00:58:29,579 --> 00:58:31,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">and no one will be able to tell the difference.</font>

778
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:34,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have a little faith, sir.</font>

779
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:38,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, would you favor us with a performance, Mr. Root?</font>

780
00:58:57,909 --> 00:59:02,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'd drink, too, if you knew the world half as well as I do.</font>

781
00:59:06,679 --> 00:59:08,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you think you were unique?</font>

782
00:59:08,449 --> 00:59:11,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been Caesar, I've played Faust.</font>

783
00:59:11,219 --> 00:59:14,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">How difficult could it possibly be to play the Great Danton?</font>

784
00:59:14,389 --> 00:59:17,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can go back to being yourself now, Root, for nothing.</font>

785
00:59:17,590 --> 00:59:19,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd rather be him for now.</font>

786
00:59:19,929 --> 00:59:22,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">I find it, uh... amusing.</font>

787
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:27,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">"My liege,</font>

788
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:31,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did deny no prisoners."</font>

789
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:33,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You look wonderful.
- Oh, thank you.</font>

790
00:59:33,579 --> 00:59:36,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Root has to keep a low profile. Anyone sees him, the game's up.</font>

791
00:59:36,909 --> 00:59:39,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know how you do things. I'm not sure I wanna know.</font>

792
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:42,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you thought what we should call it?</font>

793
00:59:42,179 --> 00:59:46,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no point being coy. Borden calls his trick The Transported Man.</font>

794
00:59:50,260 --> 00:59:53,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ladies and gentlemen, much of what you've seen may be termed</font>

795
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:57,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">as illusions or entertaining trifles.</font>

796
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:02,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alas...</font>

797
01:00:05,170 --> 01:00:07,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">I cannot claim this next feat as illusion.</font>

798
01:00:08,610 --> 01:00:09,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Watch carefully.</font>

799
01:00:11,250 --> 01:00:13,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will see no trickery,</font>

800
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:16,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">for no trickery is employed.</font>

801
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:20,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Merely a technique familiar to certain citizens of the Orient</font>

802
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:22,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">and various holy men of the Himalayas.</font>

803
01:00:25,789 --> 01:00:28,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">Indeed, many of you may be familiar with this technique,</font>

804
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:32,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">but for those of you who are not, do not be alarmed.</font>

805
01:00:32,130 --> 01:00:35,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">What you're about to see is considered safe.</font>

806
01:01:06,769 --> 01:01:09,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">To our achievement.</font>

807
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:12,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">The manager says he's never seen a reaction like it.</font>

808
01:01:12,739 --> 01:01:16,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">At least he saw it. I spent the ovation hiding under the stage.</font>

809
01:01:16,110 --> 01:01:18,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one cares about the man who disappears.</font>

810
01:01:18,510 --> 01:01:20,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">They care about the one who comes out.</font>

811
01:01:20,579 --> 01:01:22,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">I care about the man in the box.</font>

812
01:01:22,719 --> 01:01:27,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you. I don't know, maybe we could switch before the trick.</font>

813
01:01:27,090 --> 01:01:29,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm the prestige, and Root's below stage.</font>

814
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:32,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, the anticipation of the trick is everything.</font>

815
01:01:32,329 --> 01:01:35,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need your showmanship to build up the suspense.</font>

816
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:39,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once Root opens his mouth, it's over. He can't introduce this trick.</font>

817
01:01:39,099 --> 01:01:41,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course I can. I'm the Great Danton.</font>

818
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:45,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Root, you bloody fool, get out of that wardrobe and makeup.</font>

819
01:01:45,570 --> 01:01:48,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyone could walk in here at any minute.</font>

820
01:01:48,309 --> 01:01:50,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Congratulations, all.</font>

821
01:01:50,449 --> 01:01:54,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Life is not full of these moments. We worked hard.</font>

822
01:01:54,219 --> 01:01:55,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to celebrate properly.</font>

823
01:01:59,619 --> 01:02:02,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's wrong? Is it your wife?</font>

824
01:02:02,159 --> 01:02:04,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it's the trick. It isn't good enough.</font>

825
01:02:04,530 --> 01:02:07,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Borden's trick is nothing compared to ours. He has no style.</font>

826
01:02:07,929 --> 01:02:11,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">He doesn't spend the finale hiding under the stage.</font>

827
01:02:11,869 --> 01:02:14,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I need to know how he does it.
- Why?</font>

828
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:17,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I can do it better.</font>

829
01:02:19,409 --> 01:02:21,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need you to go and work for him.</font>

830
01:02:24,909 --> 01:02:26,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Work for him? Are you joking?</font>

831
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll be my spy.</font>

832
01:02:29,179 --> 01:02:31,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">We just got our start. You want me to leave?</font>

833
01:02:31,449 --> 01:02:33,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's how we advance. Think of it.</font>

834
01:02:33,619 --> 01:02:36,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">People are excited by Cutter's version. Imagine what we'd do</font>

835
01:02:36,889 --> 01:02:41,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">with the real illusion. We'd have the greatest magic act anyone's ever seen.</font>

836
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:45,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He knows I work for you.
- Exactly why he'll want to hire you.</font>

837
01:02:45,230 --> 01:02:47,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He'll want my secret.
- Why would he trust me?</font>

838
01:02:47,869 --> 01:02:50,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because you're gonna tell him the truth.</font>

839
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:55,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm?</font>

840
01:03:02,849 --> 01:03:03,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good girl.</font>

841
01:03:07,159 --> 01:03:10,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must be curious to see what so much money has bought you.</font>

842
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:14,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fitting you should be here for her maiden voyage.</font>

843
01:03:14,329 --> 01:03:16,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your hat.</font>

844
01:03:24,110 --> 01:03:26,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">You might want to stand back.</font>

845
01:03:47,159 --> 01:03:48,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't understand.</font>

846
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:50,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps it would be best if you left us to it.</font>

847
01:03:50,769 --> 01:03:52,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is there a problem, Mr. Tesla?</font>

848
01:03:52,469 --> 01:03:54,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No. Come back next week.
- Next week?</font>

849
01:03:54,570 --> 01:03:57,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Next week, it will be fine.
- Tesla!</font>

850
01:03:57,210 --> 01:03:58,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just a little temperamental.</font>

851
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:07,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Interesting workshop.
- Yeah, we make do.</font>

852
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:09,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">- My name is Olivia...
- I know who you are.</font>

853
01:04:09,980 --> 01:04:11,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here to steal the rest of my show?</font>

854
01:04:11,719 --> 01:04:13,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">To give your show what it's missing.</font>

855
01:04:13,690 --> 01:04:16,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, what might that be?
- Me.</font>

856
01:04:16,989 --> 01:04:21,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was just saying that, wasn't I?</font>

857
01:04:21,530 --> 01:04:23,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">- A woman's touch.
- I've left Angier.</font>

858
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:25,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">- All right.
- I want a job.</font>

859
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:27,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

860
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:29,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you've no reason to trust me.</font>

861
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:30,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why wouldn't I trust you?</font>

862
01:04:30,969 --> 01:04:34,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're only the mistress of my enemy. Why wouldn't I trust you?</font>

863
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:38,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mr. Borden.
- Alfred.</font>

864
01:04:40,449 --> 01:04:42,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to tell you the truth.</font>

865
01:04:42,179 --> 01:04:44,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now that is a slippery notion</font>

866
01:04:44,489 --> 01:04:46,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">in our line of work, isn't it, Miss Wenscombe?</font>

867
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:51,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am here because he sent me here.</font>

868
01:04:51,659 --> 01:04:54,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wants me to work for you and steal your secret.</font>

869
01:04:54,199 --> 01:04:57,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">What does he need my secret for? His trick is topnotch.</font>

870
01:04:57,630 --> 01:05:00,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">He vanishes, and then he reappears instantly</font>

871
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:02,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">on the other side of the stage, mute, overweight</font>

872
01:05:02,869 --> 01:05:05,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">and, unless I'm mistaken, very drunk.</font>

873
01:05:05,510 --> 01:05:09,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's astonishing. How does he do it? And tell me, Olivia,</font>

874
01:05:09,079 --> 01:05:12,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">does he enjoy taking his bows under the stage?</font>

875
01:05:12,610 --> 01:05:15,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's killing him. He's obsessed with discovering your methods.</font>

876
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:19,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">He thinks of nothing else, takes no pleasure in our success.</font>

877
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:20,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I've had enough.</font>

878
01:05:20,690 --> 01:05:23,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is no future with him.</font>

879
01:05:24,230 --> 01:05:27,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">He sent me here to steal your secrets, but I've come to offer you his.</font>

880
01:05:28,030 --> 01:05:31,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the truth... is it?</font>

881
01:05:36,469 --> 01:05:38,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Think you'd better get dressed, sir.</font>

882
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:42,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Root, you're late and more drunk than usual. Get down below stairs right away.</font>

883
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:44,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

884
01:05:44,750 --> 01:05:48,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, we need to have a little chat, Mr. Cutter.</font>

885
01:05:48,179 --> 01:05:52,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have a problem. Cutter, Borden is performing right across the street.</font>

886
01:05:52,590 --> 01:05:55,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, we have a bigger problem.</font>

887
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:58,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Root. He's realized that he can make demands.</font>

888
01:05:58,989 --> 01:06:01,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wha...? He's blackmailing us?</font>

889
01:06:01,159 --> 01:06:03,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was surprised, to tell you the truth.</font>

890
01:06:03,199 --> 01:06:05,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">It usually takes them a lot longer to figure it out.</font>

891
01:06:05,869 --> 01:06:08,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How much does he want?
- It makes no difference.</font>

892
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:11,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We've got to stop doing the trick.
- Stop the trick? Look at this.</font>

893
01:06:12,039 --> 01:06:17,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Last week they said you were the premier stage performer in London.</font>

894
01:06:17,949 --> 01:06:21,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not magician, mind you. Performer of any kind.</font>

895
01:06:21,380 --> 01:06:24,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's your point?
- My point is, you've climbed too high</font>

896
01:06:24,690 --> 01:06:27,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">to get away with professional embarrassment.</font>

897
01:06:27,190 --> 01:06:30,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't do any tricks we can't control.</font>

898
01:06:32,730 --> 01:06:36,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just pay him for now. We keep doing the trick until Borden opens,</font>

899
01:06:36,099 --> 01:06:38,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then we'll phase it out.</font>

900
01:06:38,969 --> 01:06:40,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

901
01:06:43,239 --> 01:06:45,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cutter was always surprised</font>

902
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:47,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">how fast Root turned bad.</font>

903
01:06:47,409 --> 01:06:51,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">To what do I owe the pleasure of this rather welcome pint of ale?</font>

904
01:06:52,050 --> 01:06:55,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're the Great Danton, aren't you?
- Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh.</font>

905
01:06:55,250 --> 01:06:58,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course I am, but don't advertise it, because I'll be mobbed with fans.</font>

906
01:06:58,989 --> 01:07:01,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">We paid him enough to keep him in beers.</font>

907
01:07:01,489 --> 01:07:03,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wouldn't expect him to rock the boat.</font>

908
01:07:03,659 --> 01:07:06,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Many of you may be familiar with this technique,</font>

909
01:07:06,329 --> 01:07:09,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">but for those of you who aren't, do not be alarmed.</font>

910
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:13,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">What you're about to see is considered safe.</font>

911
01:07:13,130 --> 01:07:16,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And who are you?
- I am a humble admirer</font>

912
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:19,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">and a fellow practitioner.</font>

913
01:07:19,510 --> 01:07:21,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm. Very good.</font>

914
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:34,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Another one?
- Oh, if you insist.</font>

915
01:07:34,159 --> 01:07:36,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Another.
- I'm not performing tonight.</font>

916
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:38,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm only doing one show, but to be frank,</font>

917
01:07:39,059 --> 01:07:41,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">my people pretty much run things these days.</font>

918
01:07:41,460 --> 01:07:42,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get up there.</font>

919
01:07:44,030 --> 01:07:45,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get up!</font>

920
01:07:45,170 --> 01:07:47,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your illusion, The Transported Man,</font>

921
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not claiming to know your methods,</font>

922
01:07:50,670 --> 01:07:54,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I had a similar trick in my act,</font>

923
01:07:54,940 --> 01:07:57,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">and, uh... I used a double.</font>

924
01:07:57,849 --> 01:08:03,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mm, I see, very good.
- Well, it was, and then it went bad.</font>

925
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:06,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">What I didn't count on was that when I incorporated this bloke</font>

926
01:08:06,590 --> 01:08:08,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">into my act,</font>

927
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:10,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">he had complete power over me.</font>

928
01:08:11,889 --> 01:08:13,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Complete power, you say?</font>

929
01:08:29,510 --> 01:08:30,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ohh!</font>

930
01:08:31,010 --> 01:08:36,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be very careful giving someone that power over you.</font>

931
01:08:36,350 --> 01:08:40,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh. Thank you. Um...</font>

932
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:43,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, thank you for the warning.</font>

933
01:08:43,689 --> 01:08:46,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm. Cheers.</font>

934
01:08:47,829 --> 01:08:49,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">I cannot claim this next feat as illusion.</font>

935
01:08:50,029 --> 01:08:53,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">What you're about to see is considered safe.</font>

936
01:08:57,710 --> 01:08:59,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ahh!</font>

937
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:36,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! The Great Danton.</font>

938
01:09:42,819 --> 01:09:44,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">I apologize.</font>

939
01:09:44,750 --> 01:09:48,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">There simply is too much magic...</font>

940
01:09:48,590 --> 01:09:51,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">for my stage at The Pantages</font>

941
01:09:51,430 --> 01:09:53,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">across the street.</font>

942
01:09:57,630 --> 01:10:00,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pardon my intrusion.</font>

943
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:07,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">And go easy on the poor chap. He does try so very hard.</font>

944
01:10:09,909 --> 01:10:12,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know how Borden found him.</font>

945
01:10:12,409 --> 01:10:14,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kept him under wraps. I was careful.</font>

946
01:10:14,380 --> 01:10:16,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well, he did.</font>

947
01:10:17,220 --> 01:10:19,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think it was her?</font>

948
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:28,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">You weren't expecting me?</font>

949
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:31,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">I expected you sooner. Your message said afternoon.</font>

950
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:33,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">It takes a bit for me to get around these days.</font>

951
01:10:33,630 --> 01:10:37,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's taken everything from me. My wife, my career,</font>

952
01:10:37,770 --> 01:10:39,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">- now you.
- You sent me.</font>

953
01:10:39,710 --> 01:10:42,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">I sent you to steal his secret, not to improve his act.</font>

954
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:44,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's my job.
- Or fall in love!</font>

955
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:47,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I did everything you asked!
- Yes? Yes?</font>

956
01:10:47,319 --> 01:10:48,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How does he do it?
- Cutter was right, a double.</font>

957
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:52,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">- 'Course he said that.
- He didn't say it.</font>

958
01:10:52,189 --> 01:10:55,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've seen things, makeup, glasses, wigs. We don't use for the show.</font>

959
01:10:55,689 --> 01:10:58,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I've seen it hidden backstage.
- Misdirection.</font>

960
01:10:58,489 --> 01:11:01,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">He leaves them lying around to make you think that.</font>

961
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:03,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">He doesn't know when I'm looking.</font>

962
01:11:03,199 --> 01:11:06,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">All the time, Olivia! That's who he is!</font>

963
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:07,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what it takes!</font>

964
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:10,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">He lives his act, don't you see?</font>

965
01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:15,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just because you're sleeping with him doesn't mean he trusts you.</font>

966
01:11:15,739 --> 01:11:18,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think you can see everything, don't you?</font>

967
01:11:18,210 --> 01:11:21,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Great Danton is a blind fool.</font>

968
01:11:21,119 --> 01:11:22,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">His notebook.</font>

969
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:26,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">You stole it?</font>

970
01:11:26,220 --> 01:11:28,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">I borrowed it for tonight.</font>

971
01:11:28,090 --> 01:11:30,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you could translate some of it...</font>

972
01:11:30,359 --> 01:11:34,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't. No one can. It's a cipher.</font>

973
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:37,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even with the keyword, it will take months to decode.</font>

974
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And without the keyword?
- Perhaps never.</font>

975
01:11:40,970 --> 01:11:42,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We'll see.
- We will not see.</font>

976
01:11:42,670 --> 01:11:45,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I don't get that back by tomorrow he'll know I took it.</font>

977
01:11:45,670 --> 01:11:47,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Leave him.
- I can't. He knows where I live.</font>

978
01:11:49,310 --> 01:11:54,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is his diary, Olivia. All of his secrets are right here in my hands.</font>

979
01:11:54,779 --> 01:11:56,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">It won't bring your wife back.</font>

980
01:11:56,449 --> 01:11:59,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care about my wife. I care about his secret.</font>

981
01:12:12,399 --> 01:12:15,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I'll, um...</font>

982
01:12:15,199 --> 01:12:17,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll go to his workshop and stage a break-in.</font>

983
01:12:17,609 --> 01:12:20,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He'll know you took it.
- Yes, me. Not you.</font>

984
01:12:21,909 --> 01:12:23,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Understand?</font>

985
01:12:32,350 --> 01:12:33,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robert.</font>

986
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:38,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have fallen in love with him.</font>

987
01:12:39,460 --> 01:12:41,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I know how hard this has been for you.</font>

988
01:12:50,470 --> 01:12:51,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Notebook?</font>

989
01:12:54,609 --> 01:12:56,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then he's just getting started.</font>

990
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:27,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor!</font>

991
01:13:27,369 --> 01:13:28,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good evening.</font>

992
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:35,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm walking tonight.</font>

993
01:13:35,449 --> 01:13:38,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let him come. I don't care.</font>

994
01:13:38,090 --> 01:13:40,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor! Professor!</font>

995
01:15:03,170 --> 01:15:04,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ahh!</font>

996
01:15:04,670 --> 01:15:07,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You all right?
- I'm alive.</font>

997
01:15:07,310 --> 01:15:09,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Saves me cutting you an air hole.</font>

998
01:15:23,489 --> 01:15:26,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm impressed.
- Why is that?</font>

999
01:15:26,130 --> 01:15:29,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're finally getting your hands dirty.</font>

1000
01:15:29,159 --> 01:15:32,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's what a good trick costs, Angier.</font>

1001
01:15:32,130 --> 01:15:34,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Risk, sacrifice.</font>

1002
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">The sacrifice, I'm afraid, is all gonna be yours,</font>

1003
01:15:37,569 --> 01:15:39,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">unless you give me what I want.</font>

1004
01:15:40,569 --> 01:15:42,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Which is?
- Your secret.</font>

1005
01:15:42,779 --> 01:15:44,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">My secret?</font>

1006
01:15:44,250 --> 01:15:47,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your method for The Transported Man.</font>

1007
01:15:47,449 --> 01:15:50,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fallon wouldn't tell me. He doesn't talk at all.</font>

1008
01:15:50,350 --> 01:15:53,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You have my notebook.
- Useless without the keyword.</font>

1009
01:15:55,319 --> 01:15:58,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Write down your method, Mr. Borden, describe it in full.</font>

1010
01:16:12,010 --> 01:16:14,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want the whole method, not the keyword.</font>

1011
01:16:14,439 --> 01:16:16,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know if your secret's in your notebook.</font>

1012
01:16:16,909 --> 01:16:19,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">The keyword is the method.</font>

1013
01:16:23,380 --> 01:16:24,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's my ing茅nieur?</font>

1014
01:16:31,829 --> 01:16:34,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Alive?
- How fast can you dig?</font>

1015
01:16:36,930 --> 01:16:39,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fallon, you hear me? Fallon!</font>

1016
01:16:41,270 --> 01:16:43,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How's the arm?
- Still attached.</font>

1017
01:16:45,369 --> 01:16:46,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you find your answer?</font>

1018
01:16:47,010 --> 01:16:50,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our answer, Cutter. I haven't looked yet. I wanted you to share this.</font>

1019
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:53,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">I already know how he does it, Robert.</font>

1020
01:16:53,350 --> 01:16:56,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Same way he always has, the same way as we do.</font>

1021
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:58,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just that you want something more.</font>

1022
01:16:59,050 --> 01:17:01,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, let's find out then, shall we?</font>

1023
01:17:06,130 --> 01:17:07,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">What does it mean?</font>

1024
01:17:15,399 --> 01:17:17,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">It means, Cutter, we have a journey ahead of us.</font>

1025
01:17:17,939 --> 01:17:19,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">- To America.
- Robert?</font>

1026
01:17:20,869 --> 01:17:23,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen to me.</font>

1027
01:17:23,909 --> 01:17:27,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Obsession is a young man's game.</font>

1028
01:17:27,449 --> 01:17:28,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

1029
01:17:29,050 --> 01:17:31,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't follow you any further in it.</font>

1030
01:17:32,590 --> 01:17:34,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't, I'm sorry.</font>

1031
01:17:38,630 --> 01:17:40,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then the rest is up to me.</font>

1032
01:17:42,399 --> 01:17:43,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

1033
01:17:49,239 --> 01:17:52,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good evening. Hello, darling.</font>

1034
01:17:52,909 --> 01:17:54,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Champagne, your finest.</font>

1035
01:17:54,479 --> 01:17:57,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't know we were going to be joined for dinner.</font>

1036
01:17:57,239 --> 01:17:59,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Absolutely, we are celebrating.</font>

1037
01:17:59,609 --> 01:18:01,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">Miss Wenscombe, Mr. Fallon.</font>

1038
01:18:02,319 --> 01:18:05,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What are we celebrating?
- We've hit upon a new trick.</font>

1039
01:18:05,250 --> 01:18:07,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Haven't we?
- What trick, Freddie?</font>

1040
01:18:07,390 --> 01:18:09,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, Freddie, what trick?</font>

1041
01:18:09,489 --> 01:18:13,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am going to bury myself alive every night,</font>

1042
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:17,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then someone will come along and dig me up. Wonderful.</font>

1043
01:18:17,899 --> 01:18:20,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I think he's had quite enough...
- No, pour the champagne.</font>

1044
01:18:21,069 --> 01:18:24,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pour the... Sarah, don't talk to me like that. I'm not a bloody child.</font>

1045
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:28,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Perhaps it would be better...
- Mr. Fallon, escort her home.</font>

1046
01:18:28,109 --> 01:18:30,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">- My husband's being a bore.
- Oh, please.</font>

1047
01:18:31,010 --> 01:18:34,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I see no reason you should suffer.
- Don't ruin this evening.</font>

1048
01:18:37,220 --> 01:18:40,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good night, Mrs. Borden. Good night, Freddie.</font>

1049
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:46,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Freddie?
- That's my name.</font>

1050
01:18:46,930 --> 01:18:50,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Not at home.
- I'm not always at home, am I?</font>

1051
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:54,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Couldn't you have at least taken off the beard?</font>

1052
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:59,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sarah, I just came from the bloody theater just now.</font>

1053
01:18:59,069 --> 01:19:02,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right? I'm out in public. Everybody else loves it.</font>

1054
01:19:02,210 --> 01:19:04,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you being like this?</font>

1055
01:19:04,210 --> 01:19:07,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had a terrible ordeal today.</font>

1056
01:19:07,180 --> 01:19:10,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought that something very precious...</font>

1057
01:19:12,119 --> 01:19:14,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">had been lost to me.</font>

1058
01:19:14,119 --> 01:19:17,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I just wanted to celebrate just a little.</font>

1059
01:19:17,319 --> 01:19:20,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, what? What did you lose?</font>

1060
01:19:25,930 --> 01:19:27,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see, more secrets.</font>

1061
01:19:28,439 --> 01:19:31,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sarah, secrets are my life.</font>

1062
01:19:33,539 --> 01:19:35,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Our life.
- No, Alfred, stop, this isn't you.</font>

1063
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:39,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop performing.</font>

1064
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:06,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought I had the place to myself.</font>

1065
01:20:06,069 --> 01:20:09,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unexpected guests, not very polite.</font>

1066
01:20:09,439 --> 01:20:11,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">A lot of questions.</font>

1067
01:20:11,350 --> 01:20:14,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">At first, I thought they worked for the government.</font>

1068
01:20:14,210 --> 01:20:17,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No?
- Worse, they work for Thomas Edison.</font>

1069
01:20:19,850 --> 01:20:22,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Today, a most curious development.</font>

1070
01:20:22,420 --> 01:20:25,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">His assistant came to us with a proposition.</font>

1071
01:20:27,130 --> 01:20:30,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Obviously, Angier has sent her and told her to admit as much.</font>

1072
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:33,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does he enjoy taking his bows under the stage?</font>

1073
01:20:33,470 --> 01:20:37,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">He sent me here to steal your secrets, but I've come to offer you his.</font>

1074
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:40,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the truth...</font>

1075
01:20:40,340 --> 01:20:41,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">is it?</font>

1076
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:52,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, that's what he told me to tell you. The truth...</font>

1077
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:56,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">is that I loved him and I stood by him and he sent me to you,</font>

1078
01:20:56,819 --> 01:21:00,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">like he would send a stagehand to pick up his shirts.</font>

1079
01:21:00,430 --> 01:21:03,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hate him for that.</font>

1080
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:06,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could spot Angier's methods from the back of the theater.</font>

1081
01:21:08,239 --> 01:21:10,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, what could you possibly have to offer me?</font>

1082
01:21:10,569 --> 01:21:12,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">You may know his tricks,</font>

1083
01:21:12,270 --> 01:21:15,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you can't understand why no one sees yours are better.</font>

1084
01:21:15,409 --> 01:21:17,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">You hide this. I had to look very closely</font>

1085
01:21:18,050 --> 01:21:20,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">to spot it during The Transported Man,</font>

1086
01:21:20,449 --> 01:21:23,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">but this makes you unique.</font>

1087
01:21:23,350 --> 01:21:25,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">It shows you aren't using a double.</font>

1088
01:21:25,449 --> 01:21:27,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">You mustn't hide it. You must display it proudly.</font>

1089
01:21:28,020 --> 01:21:32,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure it takes great skill to perform illusions with one good hand.</font>

1090
01:21:32,859 --> 01:21:34,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, it does.</font>

1091
01:21:36,399 --> 01:21:39,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">So let people know.</font>

1092
01:21:39,630 --> 01:21:43,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can be so much more than he is and I can show you how.</font>

1093
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:47,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think she's telling the truth.</font>

1094
01:21:47,510 --> 01:21:49,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think we cannot trust her.</font>

1095
01:21:53,180 --> 01:21:55,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I love her. I need her.</font>

1096
01:21:56,850 --> 01:22:00,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">To open myself to such a relationship,</font>

1097
01:22:00,250 --> 01:22:04,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">to the dangers of such an affair,</font>

1098
01:22:04,159 --> 01:22:08,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need assurances of fidelity, of love.</font>

1099
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">But how to be sure?</font>

1100
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:18,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know a way. It's the only way to know her mind.</font>

1101
01:22:18,210 --> 01:22:20,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">How could he send you away?</font>

1102
01:22:21,909 --> 01:22:25,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">She must help me rid ourselves of Angier.</font>

1103
01:22:31,619 --> 01:22:34,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Today, my mistress proves her truthfulness.</font>

1104
01:22:34,689 --> 01:22:36,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not to me, you understand.</font>

1105
01:22:36,489 --> 01:22:39,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been convinced since she led me to Root.</font>

1106
01:22:39,189 --> 01:22:42,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Today, Olivia proves her love for me</font>

1107
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:45,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">to you, Angier.</font>

1108
01:22:45,329 --> 01:22:49,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, Angier, she gave you this notebook at my request.</font>

1109
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:53,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">And yes, "Tesla" is merely the key to my dairy,</font>

1110
01:22:53,310 --> 01:22:56,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">not to my trick. You really think I'd part</font>

1111
01:22:56,180 --> 01:22:59,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">with my secret so easily after so much?</font>

1112
01:22:59,380 --> 01:23:01,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goodbye, Angier.</font>

1113
01:23:01,109 --> 01:23:03,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">May you find solace for your forward ambition</font>

1114
01:23:03,550 --> 01:23:05,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">back in your American home.</font>

1115
01:23:14,859 --> 01:23:16,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tesla!</font>

1116
01:23:18,430 --> 01:23:20,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tesla! Alley!</font>

1117
01:23:22,039 --> 01:23:23,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alley!</font>

1118
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:25,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tesla never made a machine like the one I asked for.</font>

1119
01:23:25,770 --> 01:23:28,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I never said he had.
- You let me believe that he had.</font>

1120
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:31,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">You stole my money because your funding was cut off.</font>

1121
01:23:31,409 --> 01:23:34,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've been shooting sparks in my top hat,</font>

1122
01:23:34,380 --> 01:23:37,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Iaughing at me all along, while using my money to stave off ruin.</font>

1123
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:40,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I have seen Edison's men.
- Where?</font>

1124
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:43,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the hotel, I have a mind to bring them up here.</font>

1125
01:23:43,489 --> 01:23:46,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">That would be unwise, Mr. Angier.</font>

1126
01:23:46,260 --> 01:23:49,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is true that you are our last remaining financier,</font>

1127
01:23:49,460 --> 01:23:51,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">but we have not stolen your money.</font>

1128
01:23:51,399 --> 01:23:52,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is my cat.</font>

1129
01:23:52,930 --> 01:23:55,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I told you I could make you a machine, I spoke a truth.</font>

1130
01:23:56,069 --> 01:23:57,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why isn't it working?</font>

1131
01:23:57,239 --> 01:23:59,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because exact science, Mr. Angier,</font>

1132
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:01,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">is not an exact science.</font>

1133
01:24:01,109 --> 01:24:04,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">The machine simply does not operate as expected.</font>

1134
01:24:04,340 --> 01:24:08,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It requires further examination.
- So where did my top hat go?</font>

1135
01:24:08,449 --> 01:24:09,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nowhere.</font>

1136
01:24:09,579 --> 01:24:12,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">We tried the damn thing a dozen times.</font>

1137
01:24:12,449 --> 01:24:14,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">The hat went nowhere.</font>

1138
01:24:14,149 --> 01:24:16,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to try different material.</font>

1139
01:24:16,119 --> 01:24:18,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">It may provoke a different result.</font>

1140
01:24:20,930 --> 01:24:22,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great.</font>

1141
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:33,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are responsible for whatever happens to this animal, doctor.</font>

1142
01:24:55,130 --> 01:24:57,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope whatever you were really doing with my money</font>

1143
01:24:57,829 --> 01:25:00,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">was more worthwhile, Mr. Tesla.</font>

1144
01:25:56,189 --> 01:25:57,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alley!</font>

1145
01:26:00,260 --> 01:26:01,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">So the machine was working?</font>

1146
01:26:02,060 --> 01:26:05,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never checked the calibration, 'cause the hat never moved.</font>

1147
01:26:05,770 --> 01:26:08,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">These things never quite work as you expect them to.</font>

1148
01:26:08,699 --> 01:26:11,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's one of the principal beauties of science.</font>

1149
01:26:11,270 --> 01:26:14,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll need a couple of weeks to iron out the problems with the machine.</font>

1150
01:26:14,909 --> 01:26:16,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll send word when it's ready.</font>

1151
01:26:19,079 --> 01:26:22,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't forget your hat.</font>

1152
01:26:22,119 --> 01:26:25,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, which one is mine?
- They are all your hats.</font>

1153
01:26:31,789 --> 01:26:34,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">You look so pretty in this new dress of yours.</font>

1154
01:26:34,859 --> 01:26:38,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are we going to the zoo?
- No, Daddy has some errands to run.</font>

1155
01:26:38,770 --> 01:26:41,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But you promised.
- I promised, did I?</font>

1156
01:26:41,069 --> 01:26:43,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then go to the zoo, we shall.</font>

1157
01:26:43,439 --> 01:26:46,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Daddy will go run his errands, and I'll be back before you know it.</font>

1158
01:26:46,970 --> 01:26:50,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you go get ready. We'll go see those chimpanzees.</font>

1159
01:26:53,710 --> 01:26:57,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sarah... what are you doing?</font>

1160
01:27:00,789 --> 01:27:03,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Each of us have our vices.</font>

1161
01:27:06,890 --> 01:27:09,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sarah, whatever you may think...</font>

1162
01:27:10,930 --> 01:27:14,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">your only competition for my affections is our little girl.</font>

1163
01:27:14,630 --> 01:27:17,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love you. I will always love you</font>

1164
01:27:17,670 --> 01:27:19,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you alone.</font>

1165
01:27:20,970 --> 01:27:24,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You mean it today.
- Absolutely.</font>

1166
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:28,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which makes it so much harder when you don't.</font>

1167
01:27:38,020 --> 01:27:40,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">More shopping. She does love the smell of money.</font>

1168
01:27:40,890 --> 01:27:45,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">The little lady wants to go to the zoo, so I thought you could take her, yeah?</font>

1169
01:27:45,270 --> 01:27:47,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I can do it tomorrow, if not.</font>

1170
01:27:47,699 --> 01:27:51,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, uh... Sarah,</font>

1171
01:27:51,069 --> 01:27:53,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">she knows.</font>

1172
01:27:53,270 --> 01:27:57,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, at least she knows that something is not right,</font>

1173
01:27:57,510 --> 01:28:00,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">so if you can just do whatever you can to help me.</font>

1174
01:28:00,479 --> 01:28:05,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Talk to her, just convince her that I do love her.</font>

1175
01:28:15,699 --> 01:28:17,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it, Freddie?</font>

1176
01:28:17,729 --> 01:28:20,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, don't call me that, please.</font>

1177
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:23,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's nothing. It's just that sometimes it seems wrong.</font>

1178
01:28:24,039 --> 01:28:26,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you, when you're with me, you're with me.</font>

1179
01:28:26,609 --> 01:28:29,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leave your family at home where they belong.</font>

1180
01:28:29,710 --> 01:28:32,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm trying. I'm trying, Olivia.</font>

1181
01:28:33,050 --> 01:28:35,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'll get dressed.
- Yeah.</font>

1182
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:39,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw Fallon hanging around again.</font>

1183
01:28:40,020 --> 01:28:42,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's something about that man I don't trust.</font>

1184
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:45,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">You trust me? Then trust Fallon.</font>

1185
01:28:45,689 --> 01:28:48,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">He protects the things that I care about.</font>

1186
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:29,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're sorry to see you go, Mr. Angier.</font>

1187
01:29:29,170 --> 01:29:31,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were sorry to see Mr. Tesla leave, as well.</font>

1188
01:29:31,909 --> 01:29:33,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's very good to Colorado Springs.</font>

1189
01:29:33,970 --> 01:29:36,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Angier,</font>

1190
01:29:36,710 --> 01:29:40,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't think it was necessary to tell Edison's men about the box.</font>

1191
01:29:40,409 --> 01:29:42,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">What box?</font>

1192
01:30:07,409 --> 01:30:09,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">I apologize for leaving without saying goodbye.</font>

1193
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:16,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I seem to have outstayed my welcome in Colorado.</font>

1194
01:30:16,180 --> 01:30:20,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">The truly extraordinary is not permitted in science and industry.</font>

1195
01:30:20,750 --> 01:30:23,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps you'll find more luck in your field,</font>

1196
01:30:23,619 --> 01:30:26,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">where people are happy to be mystified.</font>

1197
01:30:26,359 --> 01:30:30,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will find what you are looking for in this box.</font>

1198
01:30:30,399 --> 01:30:34,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alley has written you a thorough set of instructions.</font>

1199
01:30:34,899 --> 01:30:39,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">I add only one suggestion on using the machine.</font>

1200
01:30:39,710 --> 01:30:41,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Destroy it.</font>

1201
01:30:41,739 --> 01:30:45,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drop it to the bottom of the deepest ocean.</font>

1202
01:30:45,109 --> 01:30:48,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Such a thing will bring you only misery.</font>

1203
01:30:52,390 --> 01:30:56,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tesla's warning is as unheeded as he knew it would be.</font>

1204
01:30:56,090 --> 01:30:59,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Today I tested the machine. Taking precautions in case</font>

1205
01:30:59,729 --> 01:31:02,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tesla hadn't ironed out the kinks in its operation.</font>

1206
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:04,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if it went wrong,</font>

1207
01:31:04,630 --> 01:31:06,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would not want to live like that for long.</font>

1208
01:31:26,250 --> 01:31:30,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">But here at the turn, I must leave you, Borden.</font>

1209
01:31:30,460 --> 01:31:32,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, you, Borden,</font>

1210
01:31:32,760 --> 01:31:35,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">sitting there in your cell,</font>

1211
01:31:35,199 --> 01:31:39,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">reading my diary, awaiting your death,</font>

1212
01:31:39,300 --> 01:31:41,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">for my murder.</font>

1213
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:49,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">Angier's journal, that gesture of good faith, that's a fake.</font>

1214
01:31:50,010 --> 01:31:51,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">I assure you, it's not.</font>

1215
01:31:51,380 --> 01:31:54,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">The provenance of the journal is clear and under no doubt.</font>

1216
01:31:54,380 --> 01:31:58,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it's written in Angier's own hand, for which we have numerous examples.</font>

1217
01:32:00,750 --> 01:32:02,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">It don't matter.</font>

1218
01:32:04,590 --> 01:32:06,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">So my tricks.</font>

1219
01:32:09,859 --> 01:32:13,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">- All of them.
- Including The Transported Man?</font>

1220
01:32:14,770 --> 01:32:17,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Lord Caldlow will be very pleased.
- No, he won't.</font>

1221
01:32:18,039 --> 01:32:20,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're not complete.</font>

1222
01:32:20,470 --> 01:32:23,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just the pledge and the turn for each.</font>

1223
01:32:23,279 --> 01:32:27,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Without the prestige for these tricks, these are worthless.</font>

1224
01:32:27,409 --> 01:32:29,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

1225
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:33,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">You get the rest of it... when you bring my daughter here.</font>

1226
01:32:35,789 --> 01:32:38,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to say goodbye.</font>

1227
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:42,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to go through it now. We have to go through it now.</font>

1228
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, listen to me, deny it all you want.</font>

1229
01:32:45,430 --> 01:32:47,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Olivia means nothing.</font>

1230
01:32:47,869 --> 01:32:49,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Olivia?
- I need an assistant.</font>

1231
01:32:49,739 --> 01:32:52,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'll go to her, I'll tell her.
- You'll tell her what?</font>

1232
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:54,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know what you really are, Alfred.</font>

1233
01:32:55,909 --> 01:32:58,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I know.
- Sarah, Sarah, Sarah.</font>

1234
01:32:58,649 --> 01:33:01,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I can't keep it in.
- You can't talk like this.</font>

1235
01:33:01,350 --> 01:33:03,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No. No.
- Sarah, shut up! Sarah, shut up!</font>

1236
01:33:03,949 --> 01:33:08,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to hear it anymore. You can't talk like this.</font>

1237
01:33:10,689 --> 01:33:14,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't hide it anymore, because I know, Alfred, I know.</font>

1238
01:33:14,159 --> 01:33:17,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know what you really are, Alfred.</font>

1239
01:33:17,659 --> 01:33:20,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't live like this.</font>

1240
01:33:20,529 --> 01:33:22,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, well, you think I can live like this?</font>

1241
01:33:22,739 --> 01:33:25,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think I bloody enjoy living like this?</font>

1242
01:33:25,970 --> 01:33:30,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have this beautiful house, lovely little girl, we're married.</font>

1243
01:33:30,439 --> 01:33:32,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is so wrong with your life?</font>

1244
01:33:32,180 --> 01:33:34,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alfred, I can't live like this!</font>

1245
01:33:34,850 --> 01:33:37,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, what do you want from me?</font>

1246
01:33:40,550 --> 01:33:44,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">I... I want...</font>

1247
01:33:44,319 --> 01:33:47,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to be... honest with me.</font>

1248
01:33:50,130 --> 01:33:52,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">No tricks.</font>

1249
01:33:52,670 --> 01:33:54,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">No lies.</font>

1250
01:33:54,829 --> 01:33:58,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">And no secrets.</font>

1251
01:34:04,909 --> 01:34:08,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you... do you love me?</font>

1252
01:34:11,319 --> 01:34:12,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not today.</font>

1253
01:34:15,090 --> 01:34:16,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

1254
01:35:53,819 --> 01:35:54,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's there?</font>

1255
01:35:57,989 --> 01:36:00,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm looking for an old friend.</font>

1256
01:36:00,159 --> 01:36:03,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard about a booking, nice little theater,</font>

1257
01:36:03,159 --> 01:36:05,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">- good up-and-coming magician.
- You're back.</font>

1258
01:36:05,670 --> 01:36:07,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's good to see you, John.</font>

1259
01:36:08,029 --> 01:36:10,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good rehearsal space.</font>

1260
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:13,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blind stagehands, I like it.</font>

1261
01:36:13,670 --> 01:36:16,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">You always had a good eye for publicity.</font>

1262
01:36:16,409 --> 01:36:17,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need your help, John.</font>

1263
01:36:17,810 --> 01:36:20,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's my last show. A limited engagement.</font>

1264
01:36:20,680 --> 01:36:22,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your last show?</font>

1265
01:36:22,380 --> 01:36:26,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">A wise man once told me obsession was a young man's game.</font>

1266
01:36:26,590 --> 01:36:30,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm almost done. There's one thing left.</font>

1267
01:36:31,159 --> 01:36:33,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Real Transported Man.</font>

1268
01:36:35,500 --> 01:36:37,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to design a show around it?</font>

1269
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:40,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want you backstage I need you in front managing.</font>

1270
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:43,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Call in any favors or connections you have left</font>

1271
01:36:43,239 --> 01:36:44,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">to get us the right booking.</font>

1272
01:36:44,770 --> 01:36:46,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">What sort of booking you after?</font>

1273
01:36:46,939 --> 01:36:49,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">The sort that Borden can't ignore.</font>

1274
01:36:55,720 --> 01:36:58,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, what an honor it is to see you again, sir.</font>

1275
01:36:59,020 --> 01:37:02,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">You told me you only wanted to show me one trick that'd pique my interest.</font>

1276
01:37:03,060 --> 01:37:06,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's a very clever trick.
- Pleased to meet you, Mr. Ackerman.</font>

1277
01:37:06,289 --> 01:37:09,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Likewise, I'm sure. Let's get on, shall we?</font>

1278
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:14,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Turn it on, gentlemen.</font>

1279
01:37:18,909 --> 01:37:20,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very pretty.</font>

1280
01:37:31,979 --> 01:37:35,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's it, Cutter? He simply disappears?</font>

1281
01:37:35,720 --> 01:37:38,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not a trick. He has to come back.</font>

1282
01:37:38,159 --> 01:37:40,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">- There has to be a...
- A prestige?</font>

1283
01:37:40,390 --> 01:37:41,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Exactly.</font>

1284
01:37:44,399 --> 01:37:47,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pardon me.</font>

1285
01:37:47,130 --> 01:37:50,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's very rare to see...</font>

1286
01:37:50,470 --> 01:37:51,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">real magic.</font>

1287
01:37:53,439 --> 01:37:55,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's been many years since...</font>

1288
01:37:55,210 --> 01:37:56,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you interested in helping us?</font>

1289
01:37:59,010 --> 01:38:02,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes... but you'll have to dress it up a little.</font>

1290
01:38:05,020 --> 01:38:06,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Disguise it.</font>

1291
01:38:08,350 --> 01:38:10,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give them enough reason to doubt it.</font>

1292
01:38:11,659 --> 01:38:14,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">You haven't spoken about her, Freddie, not once.</font>

1293
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:18,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would I talk about her to you, hm?</font>

1294
01:38:18,729 --> 01:38:22,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because she was a part of your life and now she's gone.</font>

1295
01:38:25,569 --> 01:38:30,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, the day before she killed herself she said she wanted to meet me.</font>

1296
01:38:30,140 --> 01:38:33,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">That she had something to tell me about you.</font>

1297
01:38:33,149 --> 01:38:36,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was such a coward, I couldn't bring myself to face her.</font>

1298
01:38:36,819 --> 01:38:38,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">But...</font>

1299
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:41,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">what would she have said?</font>

1300
01:38:41,850 --> 01:38:44,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to know the truth about me?</font>

1301
01:38:46,229 --> 01:38:48,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">The truth is that...</font>

1302
01:38:50,899 --> 01:38:52,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never loved Sarah.</font>

1303
01:38:54,100 --> 01:38:55,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never loved her.</font>

1304
01:38:55,670 --> 01:38:57,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">You married her, you had a child with her.</font>

1305
01:38:57,970 --> 01:39:01,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. Part of me. Part of me did, but...</font>

1306
01:39:01,140 --> 01:39:03,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">the other part didn't.</font>

1307
01:39:03,140 --> 01:39:07,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">The part that found you, the part that's sitting here right now.</font>

1308
01:39:07,449 --> 01:39:10,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love you. No, Olivia, I love you.</font>

1309
01:39:10,579 --> 01:39:12,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the truth.</font>

1310
01:39:12,619 --> 01:39:15,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is the truth that matters.</font>

1311
01:39:15,090 --> 01:39:19,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">You could be in some other restaurant with some other woman right now,</font>

1312
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:21,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">talking about me that way.</font>

1313
01:39:21,229 --> 01:39:23,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- Yes.</font>

1314
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:30,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's inhuman to be so cold.</font>

1315
01:39:36,210 --> 01:39:37,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's back.</font>

1316
01:39:38,380 --> 01:39:41,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">After two years, he's got a new trick.</font>

1317
01:39:41,710 --> 01:39:44,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're saying it's the best London's ever seen.</font>

1318
01:39:46,590 --> 01:39:49,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should see the look on your face, Professor.</font>

1319
01:39:50,920 --> 01:39:52,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should go to him.</font>

1320
01:39:52,930 --> 01:39:55,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">You two deserve each other.</font>

1321
01:40:00,430 --> 01:40:04,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I'm afraid I'm booked. The Moscow Ballet plays through next year.</font>

1322
01:40:04,439 --> 01:40:09,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then get rid of them. There will be 100 performances, no more, no less.</font>

1323
01:40:09,079 --> 01:40:11,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Five performances a week, no matinees.</font>

1324
01:40:13,380 --> 01:40:16,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what you'll charge for each ticket. Good day.</font>

1325
01:40:39,140 --> 01:40:43,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ladies and gentlemen, my first trick of the evening involves considerable risk.</font>

1326
01:40:45,010 --> 01:40:46,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyone in the audience</font>

1327
01:40:46,449 --> 01:40:49,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">who would be irrevocably damaged by seeing a man drown</font>

1328
01:40:49,350 --> 01:40:50,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">should leave now.</font>

1329
01:40:51,020 --> 01:40:53,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I tell you the lady who taught me this illusion</font>

1330
01:40:53,890 --> 01:40:55,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">actually died performing it,</font>

1331
01:40:55,960 --> 01:40:59,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">you'll understand the seriousness of the dangers involved.</font>

1332
01:41:01,430 --> 01:41:03,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's begin.</font>

1333
01:41:13,539 --> 01:41:16,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">In my travels, I have seen the future.</font>

1334
01:41:17,979 --> 01:41:21,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it is a strange future, indeed.</font>

1335
01:41:21,649 --> 01:41:22,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">The world, ladies and gentlemen,</font>

1336
01:41:23,880 --> 01:41:26,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">is on the brink of new</font>

1337
01:41:26,250 --> 01:41:27,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">and terrifying possibilities.</font>

1338
01:41:48,470 --> 01:41:51,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">What you're about to witness is not magic.</font>

1339
01:41:53,109 --> 01:41:54,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's purely science.</font>

1340
01:41:54,579 --> 01:41:57,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd like to invite you to come up on stage now</font>

1341
01:41:57,079 --> 01:42:00,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">so that you can examine the machine for yourselves.</font>

1342
01:42:55,369 --> 01:42:57,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Man's reach</font>

1343
01:42:57,279 --> 01:43:00,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">exceeds his imagination.</font>

1344
01:43:11,689 --> 01:43:13,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bravo!</font>

1345
01:43:21,100 --> 01:43:23,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">One hundred performances. Why?</font>

1346
01:43:23,899 --> 01:43:25,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does his method dictate that?</font>

1347
01:43:25,539 --> 01:43:27,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it a publicity move? What is it?</font>

1348
01:43:27,510 --> 01:43:29,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a no-talent magician, and they call him</font>

1349
01:43:29,939 --> 01:43:32,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">the bloody best in England. Why?</font>

1350
01:43:32,409 --> 01:43:35,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fifty yards in a second! In a second!</font>

1351
01:43:35,250 --> 01:43:38,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">And all that we know is he uses a trap door.</font>

1352
01:43:38,420 --> 01:43:42,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brilliant! What is going on under that stage? Huh?</font>

1353
01:43:42,760 --> 01:43:45,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why can't you out-think him?</font>

1354
01:44:00,310 --> 01:44:05,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">They do this every night, after each performance. Yeah?</font>

1355
01:44:31,800 --> 01:44:33,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">Huh.</font>

1356
01:44:34,010 --> 01:44:36,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're done.</font>

1357
01:44:38,279 --> 01:44:39,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right?</font>

1358
01:44:41,149 --> 01:44:42,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let him have his trick.</font>

1359
01:44:42,979 --> 01:44:45,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't need his secret.</font>

1360
01:44:45,550 --> 01:44:47,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">So...</font>

1361
01:44:48,550 --> 01:44:51,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">don't go back there, you leave him alone.</font>

1362
01:44:51,590 --> 01:44:54,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">Both of us... just leave him alone.</font>

1363
01:44:54,930 --> 01:44:56,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're done.</font>

1364
01:45:05,300 --> 01:45:07,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you, John.</font>

1365
01:45:07,439 --> 01:45:09,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want you backstage on this one.</font>

1366
01:45:11,180 --> 01:45:13,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would like to invite you onstage now</font>

1367
01:45:13,649 --> 01:45:16,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">so that you can examine the machine for yourselves.</font>

1368
01:45:45,539 --> 01:45:49,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey, where do you think...?
- I'm part of the bloody act, you fool.</font>

1369
01:45:58,289 --> 01:45:59,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who was that?</font>

1370
01:46:55,850 --> 01:46:59,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey! Where's the bloody key?</font>

1371
01:47:00,050 --> 01:47:01,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's the bloody key?</font>

1372
01:47:04,060 --> 01:47:07,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's the bloody key? He's bloody drowning!</font>

1373
01:47:17,039 --> 01:47:18,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold on!</font>

1374
01:47:23,340 --> 01:47:23,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">What have you done?</font>

1375
01:47:46,630 --> 01:47:52,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alfred Borden, you have been found guilty of the murder of Robert Angier.</font>

1376
01:47:52,140 --> 01:47:56,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will be hanged by the neck until dead.</font>

1377
01:47:56,439 --> 01:47:59,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">May the Lord have mercy on your soul.</font>

1378
01:48:01,180 --> 01:48:03,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Cutter?</font>

1379
01:48:03,420 --> 01:48:05,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Owens.</font>

1380
01:48:05,119 --> 01:48:07,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, thank you for coming, Mr. Owens.</font>

1381
01:48:08,020 --> 01:48:12,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">It has fallen to me to dispose of Mr. Angier's equipment.</font>

1382
01:48:12,460 --> 01:48:14,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I notice from this manifest</font>

1383
01:48:14,130 --> 01:48:17,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">that Lord Caldlow has purchased the bulk of the items.</font>

1384
01:48:17,899 --> 01:48:21,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Cutter, if you need to know where to deliver these items...</font>

1385
01:48:21,270 --> 01:48:24,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it's just there is one particular item,</font>

1386
01:48:25,800 --> 01:48:28,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">this item, in fact,</font>

1387
01:48:28,470 --> 01:48:30,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I would like to...
- You would like to...</font>

1388
01:48:30,909 --> 01:48:31,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">buy.</font>

1389
01:48:31,979 --> 01:48:33,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Buy yourself?
- Yeah, I suppose so.</font>

1390
01:48:35,109 --> 01:48:37,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This is the machine?
- Yes.</font>

1391
01:48:37,119 --> 01:48:39,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I'm afraid Lord Caldlow was adamant</font>

1392
01:48:39,420 --> 01:48:41,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">about purchasing this particular item.</font>

1393
01:48:41,720 --> 01:48:44,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think I could talk to Lord Caldlow in person?</font>

1394
01:48:44,890 --> 01:48:47,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Out of the question, I'm afraid.</font>

1395
01:48:50,100 --> 01:48:52,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course,</font>

1396
01:48:52,060 --> 01:48:55,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">I suppose if, in the course of your delivery arrangements,</font>

1397
01:48:55,369 --> 01:48:59,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">your paths were to cross, I can't stop you speaking your mind.</font>

1398
01:48:59,909 --> 01:49:01,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

1399
01:49:03,510 --> 01:49:05,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Still here, Borden?
- For now.</font>

1400
01:49:06,279 --> 01:49:09,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got a visitor. Lord Caldlow.</font>

1401
01:49:09,310 --> 01:49:11,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">With a little girl.</font>

1402
01:49:19,689 --> 01:49:21,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jess?</font>

1403
01:49:21,659 --> 01:49:23,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, my love.</font>

1404
01:49:23,359 --> 01:49:26,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">How are you? I've missed you so much.</font>

1405
01:49:26,899 --> 01:49:29,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fallon's missed you too. We both have.</font>

1406
01:49:29,100 --> 01:49:31,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Daddy, can I come in there?</font>

1407
01:49:32,069 --> 01:49:34,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not right now. Not right now, darling.</font>

1408
01:49:34,770 --> 01:49:37,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, but everything is gonna be all right.</font>

1409
01:49:38,609 --> 01:49:40,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must be Lord Caldlow?</font>

1410
01:49:40,409 --> 01:49:44,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">Caldlow. Yes, I am. I always have been.</font>

1411
01:49:49,189 --> 01:49:51,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">They flatter you with all those chains.</font>

1412
01:49:51,460 --> 01:49:54,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't they know you can't escape without your rubber ball?</font>

1413
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:57,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">I pulled you out... out of that tank.</font>

1414
01:49:57,630 --> 01:50:01,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">All I wanted to do was prove that I was a better magician.</font>

1415
01:50:01,529 --> 01:50:03,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you couldn't leave me alone.</font>

1416
01:50:04,939 --> 01:50:07,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know what you've done.</font>

1417
01:50:08,939 --> 01:50:12,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you're not afraid to get your hands dirty anymore, are you?</font>

1418
01:50:12,710 --> 01:50:15,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, not anymore. And I win.</font>

1419
01:50:16,050 --> 01:50:19,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one cares about the man in the box, the man who disappears.</font>

1420
01:50:19,449 --> 01:50:20,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">You win?</font>

1421
01:50:22,020 --> 01:50:26,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">This ain't a bloody competition anymore. This is my little girl's life.</font>

1422
01:50:26,760 --> 01:50:29,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">And don't you dare put her in the middle of this.</font>

1423
01:50:29,829 --> 01:50:32,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I know how hard it is to have someone so special</font>

1424
01:50:32,899 --> 01:50:35,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">taken away from you, don't I, Borden?</font>

1425
01:50:36,270 --> 01:50:39,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you can't take it with you, now, can you?</font>

1426
01:50:39,069 --> 01:50:40,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, she'll be looked after.</font>

1427
01:50:41,039 --> 01:50:43,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goodbye, Professor. Come on, darling.</font>

1428
01:50:43,140 --> 01:50:44,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no, no, stop, my darling.</font>

1429
01:50:44,979 --> 01:50:47,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, here.</font>

1430
01:50:48,649 --> 01:50:51,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what you're after. That's what this is about.</font>

1431
01:50:52,720 --> 01:50:54,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take it.</font>

1432
01:50:54,149 --> 01:50:55,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Your secret?
- Yeah.</font>

1433
01:50:59,060 --> 01:51:02,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">You always were the better magician. We both know that.</font>

1434
01:51:03,260 --> 01:51:05,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever your secret was, you have to agree,</font>

1435
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:08,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">mine is better.</font>

1436
01:51:10,039 --> 01:51:13,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't do this. Don't do this, Angier. Jess, Jess!</font>

1437
01:51:13,470 --> 01:51:17,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jess, I'm gonna take you home soon. I promise.</font>

1438
01:51:17,079 --> 01:51:19,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">- For God's sake.
- I promise. Look!</font>

1439
01:51:23,479 --> 01:51:27,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">I promise. I love you, Jess.</font>

1440
01:51:27,149 --> 01:51:28,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love you.</font>

1441
01:51:28,890 --> 01:51:30,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Come on.
- I love you.</font>

1442
01:51:30,590 --> 01:51:32,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love you, Jess.</font>

1443
01:51:32,359 --> 01:51:34,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">Angier! Angier!</font>

1444
01:51:34,760 --> 01:51:36,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, do you think this place can hold me?</font>

1445
01:51:36,930 --> 01:51:39,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Angier! They're gonna bloody hang me!</font>

1446
01:51:40,029 --> 01:51:42,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you can put a stop to this now!</font>

1447
01:51:43,199 --> 01:51:45,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen! Listen! That man...</font>

1448
01:51:45,470 --> 01:51:47,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, that man is the one I'm in for killing!</font>

1449
01:51:47,909 --> 01:51:52,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen! If he's alive, I'm not guilty!</font>

1450
01:51:52,310 --> 01:51:54,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm not guilty!
- I don't care!</font>

1451
01:51:54,649 --> 01:51:56,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Get hold of him.
- Angier!</font>

1452
01:52:01,420 --> 01:52:03,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">Run along now.</font>

1453
01:52:04,060 --> 01:52:06,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir, there's a gentleman waiting.</font>

1454
01:52:23,409 --> 01:52:26,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Dear God.
- Hello, Cutter.</font>

1455
01:52:27,109 --> 01:52:29,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're still alive.</font>

1456
01:52:29,609 --> 01:52:31,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">How is it you're still alive?</font>

1457
01:52:31,550 --> 01:52:33,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw you on a slab, for God's sake.</font>

1458
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:38,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Child.
- Good night, sir.</font>

1459
01:52:39,060 --> 01:52:41,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good night, Jess.</font>

1460
01:52:42,260 --> 01:52:43,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've seen her before.</font>

1461
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw her in court with...</font>

1462
01:52:47,470 --> 01:52:49,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fallon.</font>

1463
01:52:51,199 --> 01:52:53,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What have you done?
- She needs looking after.</font>

1464
01:52:53,869 --> 01:52:56,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">She needs her father.</font>

1465
01:52:56,439 --> 01:52:59,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're letting him hang, and I helped you.</font>

1466
01:52:59,479 --> 01:53:04,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">I came here to beg Lord Caldlow to let me destroy that machine.</font>

1467
01:53:05,880 --> 01:53:09,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am not going to beg you for anything.</font>

1468
01:53:09,390 --> 01:53:12,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have to. I'm gonna make sure it is never used again.</font>

1469
01:53:13,789 --> 01:53:16,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then, Lord Caldlow...</font>

1470
01:53:19,430 --> 01:53:21,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">where do you want me to deliver it?</font>

1471
01:53:21,569 --> 01:53:25,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">My theater. It belongs with the prestige materials.</font>

1472
01:53:25,800 --> 01:53:28,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">John, I tried not to involve you.</font>

1473
01:53:41,350 --> 01:53:43,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">So...</font>

1474
01:53:45,659 --> 01:53:48,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">We go alone now.</font>

1475
01:53:48,329 --> 01:53:50,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Both of us.</font>

1476
01:53:53,569 --> 01:53:56,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I don't have as far to go as you.</font>

1477
01:54:02,270 --> 01:54:03,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

1478
01:54:05,140 --> 01:54:08,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were right. I should have left him to his damn trick.</font>

1479
01:54:09,979 --> 01:54:12,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

1480
01:54:13,619 --> 01:54:15,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry for a lot of things.</font>

1481
01:54:17,090 --> 01:54:19,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry about Sarah.</font>

1482
01:54:20,930 --> 01:54:24,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Didn't mean to hurt her, I didn't.</font>

1483
01:54:26,260 --> 01:54:30,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">You go live your life in full now, all right? You live for both of us.</font>

1484
01:54:39,439 --> 01:54:40,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goodbye.</font>

1485
01:55:26,729 --> 01:55:29,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you watching closely?</font>

1486
01:56:00,529 --> 01:56:02,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put it down on the end.</font>

1487
01:56:35,859 --> 01:56:39,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take a minute to consider your achievement.</font>

1488
01:56:40,699 --> 01:56:43,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">I once told you about a sailor</font>

1489
01:56:43,569 --> 01:56:45,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">who described drowning to me.</font>

1490
01:56:45,939 --> 01:56:48,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, he said it was like going home.</font>

1491
01:56:49,239 --> 01:56:53,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was lying. He said it was agony.</font>

1492
01:57:32,750 --> 01:57:36,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alfred Borden, this day, in the name of the king</font>

1493
01:57:36,989 --> 01:57:38,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the High Court of England,</font>

1494
01:57:39,060 --> 01:57:40,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">you will meet your end.</font>

1495
01:57:42,989 --> 01:57:45,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one cares about the man in the box.</font>

1496
01:57:49,869 --> 01:57:51,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cutter?</font>

1497
01:57:56,270 --> 01:57:57,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cutter!</font>

1498
01:57:59,680 --> 01:58:01,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you have anything to say?</font>

1499
01:58:06,680 --> 01:58:08,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Abracadabra.</font>

1500
01:58:44,720 --> 01:58:47,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">A brother? A twin?</font>

1501
01:58:49,289 --> 01:58:51,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were Fallon.</font>

1502
01:58:53,159 --> 01:58:55,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The whole time?
- No.</font>

1503
01:58:56,869 --> 01:58:59,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were both Fallon.</font>

1504
01:58:59,270 --> 01:59:01,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were both Borden.</font>

1505
01:59:06,539 --> 01:59:09,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Were you the one who went into the box?</font>

1506
01:59:09,579 --> 01:59:11,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or the one who came back out?</font>

1507
01:59:12,579 --> 01:59:14,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">We took turns.</font>

1508
01:59:19,689 --> 01:59:21,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">The trick is where we would swap.</font>

1509
01:59:27,970 --> 01:59:29,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cutter knew. Cutter knew.</font>

1510
01:59:29,930 --> 01:59:32,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I told him it was too simple, too easy.</font>

1511
01:59:33,399 --> 01:59:34,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

1512
01:59:35,939 --> 01:59:37,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Simple, maybe, but not easy.</font>

1513
01:59:37,979 --> 01:59:41,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's nothing easy about two men sharing one life.</font>

1514
01:59:47,420 --> 01:59:50,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't understand, how it can be bleeding again?</font>

1515
01:59:54,090 --> 01:59:56,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wha... What about Olivia and your wife?</font>

1516
01:59:57,899 --> 01:59:59,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">We each loved one of them.</font>

1517
02:00:03,430 --> 02:00:06,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">I loved Sarah.</font>

1518
02:00:06,239 --> 02:00:08,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">He loved Olivia.</font>

1519
02:00:08,840 --> 02:00:11,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">We each had half of a full life,</font>

1520
02:00:11,340 --> 02:00:14,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">really, which was enough for us...</font>

1521
02:00:14,409 --> 02:00:15,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">just.</font>

1522
02:00:18,050 --> 02:00:19,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">But not for them.</font>

1523
02:00:22,350 --> 02:00:24,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, sacrifice, Robert,</font>

1524
02:00:24,659 --> 02:00:27,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">that's the price of a good trick.</font>

1525
02:00:29,430 --> 02:00:31,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?</font>

1526
02:00:35,270 --> 02:00:37,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've... I've made sacrifices.</font>

1527
02:00:37,270 --> 02:00:39,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- Yes.</font>

1528
02:00:39,699 --> 02:00:42,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">It takes nothing to steal another man's work.</font>

1529
02:00:42,869 --> 02:00:45,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, it takes everything.</font>

1530
02:01:05,699 --> 02:01:07,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, wait, I'm not...</font>

1531
02:01:14,510 --> 02:01:17,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">It took courage.</font>

1532
02:01:19,140 --> 02:01:22,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">It took courage to climb into that machine every night,</font>

1533
02:01:23,149 --> 02:01:25,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">not knowing...</font>

1534
02:01:25,649 --> 02:01:27,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">if I'd be the man in the box...</font>

1535
02:01:30,819 --> 02:01:32,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">or in the prestige.</font>

1536
02:01:33,420 --> 02:01:36,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you want to see...</font>

1537
02:01:36,529 --> 02:01:38,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">what it cost me?</font>

1538
02:01:38,899 --> 02:01:41,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">You didn't see where you are, did you?</font>

1539
02:01:42,569 --> 02:01:44,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look. Look.</font>

1540
02:01:46,069 --> 02:01:47,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care.</font>

1541
02:01:52,279 --> 02:01:55,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">You went halfway around the world.</font>

1542
02:01:55,909 --> 02:01:58,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">You spent a fortune.</font>

1543
02:02:00,750 --> 02:02:03,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">You did terrible things.</font>

1544
02:02:04,289 --> 02:02:06,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really terrible things, Robert.</font>

1545
02:02:08,789 --> 02:02:10,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">And all for nothing.</font>

1546
02:02:11,260 --> 02:02:12,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">For nothing?</font>

1547
02:02:12,529 --> 02:02:13,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

1548
02:02:17,539 --> 02:02:20,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">You never understood...</font>

1549
02:02:20,239 --> 02:02:22,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">why we did this.</font>

1550
02:02:25,340 --> 02:02:27,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">The audience knows the truth.</font>

1551
02:02:29,050 --> 02:02:31,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">The world is simple.</font>

1552
02:02:31,550 --> 02:02:33,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's miserable.</font>

1553
02:02:33,350 --> 02:02:37,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Solid... Solid all the way through.</font>

1554
02:02:39,390 --> 02:02:41,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if you could fool them,</font>

1555
02:02:41,789 --> 02:02:43,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">even for a second...</font>

1556
02:02:45,500 --> 02:02:47,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">then you could make them wonder.</font>

1557
02:02:49,029 --> 02:02:51,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then you...</font>

1558
02:02:51,300 --> 02:02:53,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then you got to see something</font>

1559
02:02:53,600 --> 02:02:55,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">very special.</font>

1560
02:02:59,579 --> 02:03:02,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">You really don't know.</font>

1561
02:03:05,180 --> 02:03:06,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was...</font>

1562
02:03:07,920 --> 02:03:10,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">it was the look on their faces.</font>

1563
02:03:26,069 --> 02:03:30,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every magic trick consists of three parts, or acts.</font>

1564
02:03:34,350 --> 02:03:37,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">The first part is called "the pledge".</font>

1565
02:03:37,880 --> 02:03:40,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">The magician shows you something ordinary.</font>

1566
02:03:41,789 --> 02:03:44,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">The second act is called "the turn".</font>

1567
02:03:46,189 --> 02:03:49,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">The magician takes the ordinary something</font>

1568
02:03:49,130 --> 02:03:51,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">and makes it into something extraordinary.</font>

1569
02:03:53,329 --> 02:03:57,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you wouldn't clap yet, because making something disappear</font>

1570
02:03:57,300 --> 02:04:01,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">isn't enough. You have to bring it back.</font>

1571
02:04:35,840 --> 02:04:38,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now you're looking for the secret.</font>

1572
02:04:41,210 --> 02:04:44,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you won't find it, because, of course, you're not really looking.</font>

1573
02:04:48,050 --> 02:04:51,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't really want to work it out.</font>

1574
02:04:54,289 --> 02:04:56,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to be fooled.</font>
