1
00:01:48,015 --> 00:01:50,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bloody kids.</font>

2
00:02:36,864 --> 00:02:40,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">How fastidious you've become,
Wormtail.</font>

3
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:45,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">As I recall, you once called
the nearest gutter pipe home.</font>

4
00:02:45,272 --> 00:02:50,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could it be that the task of nursing me
has become wearisome for you?</font>

5
00:02:50,645 --> 00:02:53,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no. No, no, my Lord Voldemort.</font>

6
00:02:53,313 --> 00:02:54,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">I only meant...</font>

7
00:02:54,715 --> 00:02:57,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">perhaps if we were to do it
without the boy.</font>

8
00:02:57,852 --> 00:03:00,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! The boy is everything!</font>

9
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:04,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">It cannot be done without him.
And it will be done.</font>

10
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:07,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">Exactly as I said.</font>

11
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:11,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I will not disappoint you, my Lord.
- Good.</font>

12
00:03:11,064 --> 00:03:14,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">First, gather our old comrades.</font>

13
00:03:14,301 --> 00:03:16,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">Send them a sign.</font>

14
00:03:28,248 --> 00:03:31,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nagini tells me
the old Muggle caretaker...</font>

15
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:35,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">is standing just outside the door.</font>

16
00:03:35,789 --> 00:03:41,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">Step aside, Wormtail,
so I can give our guest a proper greeting.</font>

17
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:43,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">Avada Kedavra!</font>

18
00:03:48,135 --> 00:03:49,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry.</font>

19
00:03:50,371 --> 00:03:52,281
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry!</font>

20
00:03:53,341 --> 00:03:55,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you all right?</font>

21
00:03:55,843 --> 00:03:58,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hermione. Bad dream.</font>

22
00:03:58,111 --> 00:04:01,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">- When did you get here?
- Just now. You?</font>

23
00:04:01,649 --> 00:04:03,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">Last night.</font>

24
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:05,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wake up! Wake up, Ronald!</font>

25
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:06,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bloody hell.</font>

26
00:04:06,888 --> 00:04:08,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">Honestly, get dressed.</font>

27
00:04:09,157 --> 00:04:11,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">And don't go back to sleep.</font>

28
00:04:11,057 --> 00:04:14,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, Ron!
Your mother says breakfast's ready!</font>

29
00:04:21,067 --> 00:04:24,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ron, where are we actually going?
- Don't know.</font>

30
00:04:24,372 --> 00:04:27,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey, Dad. Where are we going?
- Haven't the foggiest.</font>

31
00:04:27,807 --> 00:04:29,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep up!</font>

32
00:04:31,913 --> 00:04:33,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Arthur!</font>

33
00:04:33,915 --> 00:04:36,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's about time, son.</font>

34
00:04:36,082 --> 00:04:40,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, Amos. Some of us
had a bit of a sleepy start.</font>

35
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:46,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is Amos Diggory, everyone.
Works with me at the Ministry.</font>

36
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:49,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">And this strapping young lad
must be Cedric, am I right?</font>

37
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:50,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, sir.</font>

38
00:04:50,497 --> 00:04:52,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">This way.</font>

39
00:04:53,901 --> 00:04:57,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">Merlin's beard!
You must be Harry Potter.</font>

40
00:04:57,437 --> 00:05:00,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes, sir.
- Great, great pleasure.</font>

41
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:02,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pleasure to meet you too, sir.</font>

42
00:05:04,778 --> 00:05:07,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, it's just over there.</font>

43
00:05:09,716 --> 00:05:11,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Shall we?
- Oh, yeah.</font>

44
00:05:11,685 --> 00:05:13,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't want to be late.</font>

45
00:05:13,053 --> 00:05:17,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on. Nearly there now.
Get yourself into a good position.</font>

46
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:20,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are they all standing around
that manky old boot?</font>

47
00:05:20,694 --> 00:05:23,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That isn't just any manky old boot.
- It's a Portkey.</font>

48
00:05:23,363 --> 00:05:24,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">Time to go!</font>

49
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:26,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's a Portkey?</font>

50
00:05:26,667 --> 00:05:30,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ready! After three. One, two...
- Harry!</font>

51
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">three!</font>

52
00:05:43,016 --> 00:05:44,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let go, kids!</font>

53
00:05:44,317 --> 00:05:47,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- Let go!</font>

54
00:05:58,966 --> 00:06:01,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll bet that cleared your sinuses, eh?</font>

55
00:06:02,603 --> 00:06:05,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Total shambles, as per usual.
- Thanks.</font>

56
00:06:10,877 --> 00:06:13,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on, look at that!</font>

57
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:18,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, kids, welcome to
the Quidditch World Cup!</font>

58
00:06:20,788 --> 00:06:23,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay together! Keep up, girls!</font>

59
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:26,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look!</font>

60
00:06:27,127 --> 00:06:29,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on! Keep up, girls!</font>

61
00:06:36,303 --> 00:06:37,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blimey!</font>

62
00:06:37,872 --> 00:06:39,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">Parting of the ways, I think, old chap.</font>

63
00:06:39,906 --> 00:06:41,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">- See you at the match.
- See you.</font>

64
00:06:41,475 --> 00:06:42,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Cedric.
- Ced, come on.</font>

65
00:06:42,942 --> 00:06:44,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">See you later, Cedric.</font>

66
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">Home sweet home.</font>

67
00:06:53,153 --> 00:06:54,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

68
00:07:02,096 --> 00:07:04,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Excellent, excellent.
- Ginny, look!</font>

69
00:07:04,165 --> 00:07:05,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">- All to the bath.
- Look.</font>

70
00:07:05,632 --> 00:07:08,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">Girls, choose a bunk and unpack.</font>

71
00:07:08,735 --> 00:07:11,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ron, get out of the kitchen.
We're all hungry.</font>

72
00:07:11,338 --> 00:07:13,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, get out of the kitchen, Ron!
- Feet off the table!</font>

73
00:07:13,973 --> 00:07:16,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Feet off the table!
- Feet off the table!</font>

74
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:19,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love magic.</font>

75
00:07:34,928 --> 00:07:38,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get your Quidditch World Cup
programs here!</font>

76
00:07:38,665 --> 00:07:42,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blimey, Dad. How far up are we?</font>

77
00:07:42,002 --> 00:07:43,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, put it this way:</font>

78
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">If it rains...</font>

79
00:07:45,572 --> 00:07:48,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">you'll be the first to know.</font>

80
00:07:48,675 --> 00:07:51,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">Father and I are in
the minister's box...</font>

81
00:07:51,245 --> 00:07:54,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">by personal invitation
of Cornelius Fudge himself.</font>

82
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:57,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't boast, Draco.</font>

83
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:59,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no need with these people.</font>

84
00:08:01,622 --> 00:08:04,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do enjoy yourself, won't you?</font>

85
00:08:04,524 --> 00:08:06,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">While you can.</font>

86
00:08:19,774 --> 00:08:24,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on up. Take your seats. I told you
these seats would be worth waiting for.</font>

87
00:08:24,612 --> 00:08:26,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on!</font>

88
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:30,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the Irish! There's Troy!</font>

89
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:32,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And Mullet!
- And Moran!</font>

90
00:08:38,359 --> 00:08:41,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ireland! Ireland! Ireland!</font>

91
00:08:45,499 --> 00:08:48,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Here come the Bulgarians!
- Yes!</font>

92
00:08:54,774 --> 00:08:56,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's that?</font>

93
00:08:56,876 --> 00:09:00,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">That, sis, is the best Seeker
in the world.</font>

94
00:09:01,981 --> 00:09:05,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Krum! Krum! Krum!</font>

95
00:09:10,256 --> 00:09:11,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">Krum!</font>

96
00:09:11,658 --> 00:09:13,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes!</font>

97
00:09:21,134 --> 00:09:23,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good evening!</font>

98
00:09:23,571 --> 00:09:26,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">As Minister for Magic...</font>

99
00:09:26,807 --> 00:09:30,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">it gives me great pleasure...</font>

100
00:09:30,443 --> 00:09:34,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">to welcome
each and every one of you...</font>

101
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:39,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">to the final
of the 422nd Quidditch World Cup!</font>

102
00:09:40,888 --> 00:09:42,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let the match...</font>

103
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:44,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">begin!</font>

104
00:09:50,364 --> 00:09:52,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">Krum! Krum! Krum!</font>

105
00:10:00,374 --> 00:10:02,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no one like Krum.</font>

106
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:03,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Krum?
- Dumb Krum?</font>

107
00:10:03,977 --> 00:10:07,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's like a bird,
the way he rides the wind.</font>

108
00:10:07,214 --> 00:10:10,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He's more than an athlete.
- Dumb Krum.</font>

109
00:10:10,283 --> 00:10:11,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's an artist.</font>

110
00:10:11,851 --> 00:10:14,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I think you're in love, Ron.
- Shut up.</font>

111
00:10:14,288 --> 00:10:15,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Viktor, I love you</font>

112
00:10:15,855 --> 00:10:17,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">Viktor, I do</font>

113
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:21,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">When we're apart
My heart beats only for you</font>

114
00:10:21,028 --> 00:10:23,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sounds like the Irish
have got their pride on.</font>

115
00:10:23,864 --> 00:10:25,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop! Stop it!</font>

116
00:10:26,133 --> 00:10:27,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not the Irish.</font>

117
00:10:28,869 --> 00:10:31,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've gotta get out of here. Now!</font>

118
00:10:33,139 --> 00:10:35,674
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out, it's the Death Eaters!</font>

119
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:39,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get back to the Portkey, everybody,
and stick together!</font>

120
00:10:39,212 --> 00:10:42,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fred, George!
Ginny is your responsibility.</font>

121
00:10:42,415 --> 00:10:44,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go!</font>

122
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:46,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry!</font>

123
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Keep up, you lot!
- Harry!</font>

124
00:11:04,437 --> 00:11:06,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry! Harry!</font>

00:11:54,221 --> 00:11:55,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">Morsmordre!</font>

00:12:22,482 --> 00:12:24,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry!</font>

127
00:12:25,451 --> 00:12:28,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where are you?
- Harry!</font>

128
00:12:29,923 --> 00:12:32,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've been looking for you for ages!</font>

129
00:12:33,661 --> 00:12:35,741
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thought we lost you, mate.</font>

130
00:12:36,296 --> 00:12:38,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is that?</font>

131
00:12:41,402 --> 00:12:43,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stupefy!</font>

132
00:12:43,636 --> 00:12:45,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop!</font>

133
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's my son!</font>

134
00:12:48,408 --> 00:12:51,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ron, Harry, Hermione, you all right?
- We came back for Harry.</font>

135
00:12:51,245 --> 00:12:52,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which of you conjured it?</font>

136
00:12:52,712 --> 00:12:55,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Crouch, you can't possi...
- Do not lie!</font>

137
00:12:55,048 --> 00:12:57,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've been discovered
at the scene of the crime.</font>

138
00:12:57,216 --> 00:12:59,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Crime?
- Barty! They're just kids.</font>

139
00:12:59,419 --> 00:13:01,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">What crime?</font>

140
00:13:01,087 --> 00:13:03,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the Dark Mark, Harry. It's his mark.</font>

141
00:13:03,756 --> 00:13:05,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, Voldemort?</font>

142
00:13:06,092 --> 00:13:10,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those people tonight, in the masks,
they're his too, aren't they?</font>

143
00:13:10,129 --> 00:13:12,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">- His followers?
- Yeah.</font>

144
00:13:12,566 --> 00:13:14,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">Death Eaters.</font>

145
00:13:15,168 --> 00:13:19,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Follow me.
- There was a man, before.</font>

146
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:21,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">There!</font>

147
00:13:21,207 --> 00:13:23,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">All of you, this way!</font>

148
00:13:24,244 --> 00:13:25,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">A man, Harry?</font>

149
00:13:25,979 --> 00:13:27,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who?</font>

150
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

151
00:13:31,284 --> 00:13:33,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't see his face.</font>

152
00:13:49,736 --> 00:13:51,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anything from the trolley?</font>

153
00:13:53,841 --> 00:13:57,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anything from the trolley?</font>

154
00:14:00,913 --> 00:14:02,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anything from the trolley, dears?</font>

155
00:14:02,816 --> 00:14:05,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">Packet of Drooble's...</font>

156
00:14:05,184 --> 00:14:07,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">and a Licorice Wand.</font>

157
00:14:08,455 --> 00:14:10,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">On second thought, just the Drooble's.</font>

158
00:14:10,691 --> 00:14:14,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's all right, I'll get it. Don't worry.
- Just the Drooble's. Thanks.</font>

159
00:14:15,962 --> 00:14:18,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two Pumpkin Pasties, please.</font>

160
00:14:23,736 --> 00:14:25,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

161
00:14:26,005 --> 00:14:28,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anything sweet for you, dear?</font>

162
00:14:29,042 --> 00:14:31,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no, I'm not hungry. Thank you.</font>

163
00:14:32,278 --> 00:14:34,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anything from the trolley?</font>

164
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is horrible.</font>

165
00:14:36,884 --> 00:14:39,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">How can the Ministry
not know who conjured it?</font>

166
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wasn't there any security or...?</font>

167
00:14:41,721 --> 00:14:44,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Loads, according to Dad.</font>

168
00:14:44,691 --> 00:14:48,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what worried them so much.
Happened right under their noses.</font>

169
00:14:51,264 --> 00:14:54,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's hurting again, isn't it? Your scar.</font>

170
00:14:54,868 --> 00:14:56,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm fine.</font>

171
00:14:58,572 --> 00:15:01,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know Sirius will
want to hear about this...</font>

172
00:15:01,642 --> 00:15:05,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">what you saw at the World Cup
and the dream.</font>

173
00:15:14,053 --> 00:15:17,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hedwig. There we go.</font>

174
00:15:56,429 --> 00:15:58,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clear the runway!</font>

175
00:16:04,136 --> 00:16:07,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, there's something
you don't see every day.</font>

176
00:16:30,898 --> 00:16:36,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, now we're all settled in and sorted,
I'd like to make an announcement.</font>

177
00:16:36,802 --> 00:16:40,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">This castle will not only be
your home this year...</font>

178
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:43,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">but home to some
very special guests as well.</font>

179
00:16:43,911 --> 00:16:46,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see, Hogwarts has been chosen...</font>

180
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, what is it?</font>

181
00:16:49,182 --> 00:16:50,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it?</font>

182
00:16:52,885 --> 00:16:56,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell them to wait.
Tell them to wait. Wait.</font>

183
00:16:56,423 --> 00:17:01,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">So Hogwarts has been chosen
to host a legendary event:</font>

184
00:17:02,528 --> 00:17:04,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Triwizard Tournament.</font>

185
00:17:05,132 --> 00:17:07,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">- For those of you who do not know...
- Brilliant.</font>

186
00:17:07,366 --> 00:17:10,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">the Triwizard Tournament
brings together three schools...</font>

187
00:17:10,703 --> 00:17:13,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">for a series of magical contests.</font>

188
00:17:13,006 --> 00:17:16,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">From each school, a single student
is selected to compete.</font>

189
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:18,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now let me be clear.</font>

190
00:17:18,577 --> 00:17:21,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">If chosen, you stand alone.</font>

191
00:17:21,682 --> 00:17:23,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">And trust me when I say...</font>

192
00:17:23,784 --> 00:17:27,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">these contests are not
for the faint-hearted.</font>

193
00:17:27,054 --> 00:17:31,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">But more of that later.
For now, please join me in welcoming...</font>

194
00:17:31,557 --> 00:17:35,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">the lovely ladies of the
Beauxbatons Academy of Magic...</font>

195
00:17:35,761 --> 00:17:40,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">and their headmistress,
Madame Maxime.</font>

196
00:17:52,311 --> 00:17:54,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bloody hell.</font>

197
00:18:01,721 --> 00:18:04,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blimey. That's one big woman.</font>

198
00:18:26,078 --> 00:18:28,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now our friends from the north.</font>

199
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:31,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please greet the proud sons
of Durmstrang...</font>

200
00:18:31,317 --> 00:18:34,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">and their high master,
Igor Karkaroff.</font>

201
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:58,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it's Krum!</font>

202
00:18:58,944 --> 00:19:00,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blimey, it's him!</font>

203
00:19:00,579 --> 00:19:02,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">Viktor Krum!</font>

204
00:19:11,357 --> 00:19:12,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">Albus.</font>

205
00:19:12,959 --> 00:19:14,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">Igor.</font>

206
00:19:28,307 --> 00:19:32,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Dumbly-dorr,
my horses have traveled a long way.</font>

207
00:19:32,144 --> 00:19:34,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">- They will need attending to.
- Don't worry, Madame Maxime.</font>

208
00:19:34,847 --> 00:19:38,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our gamekeeper, Hagrid,
is more than capable of seeing to them.</font>

209
00:19:38,551 --> 00:19:41,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you know, Monsieur Hagrid...</font>

210
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">they drink only single-malt whiskey.</font>

211
00:19:49,863 --> 00:19:51,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">You idiot!</font>

212
00:19:56,603 --> 00:19:58,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your attention, please!</font>

213
00:20:00,941 --> 00:20:03,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd like to say a few words.</font>

214
00:20:04,845 --> 00:20:07,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eternal glory.</font>

215
00:20:07,346 --> 00:20:11,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is what awaits the student
who wins the Triwizard Tournament.</font>

216
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:15,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">But to do this, that student
must survive three tasks.</font>

217
00:20:15,922 --> 00:20:20,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three extremely dangerous tasks.</font>

218
00:20:20,326 --> 00:20:21,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Wicked.
- Wicked.</font>

219
00:20:21,494 --> 00:20:25,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">For this reason, the Ministry has seen fit
to impose a new rule.</font>

220
00:20:25,898 --> 00:20:27,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">To explain all this...</font>

221
00:20:27,433 --> 00:20:31,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">we have the head of the Department
of International Magical Cooperation...</font>

222
00:20:31,238 --> 00:20:33,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Bartemius Crouch.</font>

223
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bloody hell. It's Mad-Eye Moody.</font>

224
00:20:51,324 --> 00:20:54,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Alastor Moody? The Auror?
- Auror?</font>

225
00:20:54,693 --> 00:20:58,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dark-wizard catcher. Half the cells
in Azkaban are filled thanks to him.</font>

226
00:20:58,865 --> 00:21:02,209
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's supposed to be mad as a hatter,
though, these days.</font>

227
00:21:13,747 --> 00:21:17,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">- My dear old friend, thanks for coming.
- Stupid ceiling.</font>

228
00:21:17,683 --> 00:21:19,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

229
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:27,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's that he's drinking,
do you suppose?</font>

230
00:21:27,594 --> 00:21:30,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know, but I don't think
it's pumpkin juice.</font>

231
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:39,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">After due consideration...</font>

232
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:42,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">the Ministry has concluded that,
for their own safety...</font>

233
00:21:42,741 --> 00:21:45,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">no student under the age of 17...</font>

234
00:21:45,878 --> 00:21:49,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">shall be allowed to put forth their
name for the Triwizard Tournament.</font>

235
00:21:49,782 --> 00:21:52,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This decision is final.
- That's rubbish!</font>

236
00:21:52,652 --> 00:21:55,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's rubbish!
You don't know what you're doing!</font>

237
00:21:55,422 --> 00:21:59,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Silence!
- They're not too happy about that, then.</font>

238
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:21,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Goblet of Fire.</font>

239
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:24,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyone wishing to submit themselves
to the tournament...</font>

240
00:22:24,617 --> 00:22:27,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">need only write their name
upon a piece of parchment...</font>

241
00:22:27,686 --> 00:22:31,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">and throw it in the flame before
this hour on Thursday night.</font>

242
00:22:31,891 --> 00:22:34,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do not do so lightly.</font>

243
00:22:34,493 --> 00:22:38,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">If chosen, there's no turning back.</font>

244
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:43,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">As from this moment,
the Triwizard Tournament has begun.</font>

245
00:23:09,362 --> 00:23:11,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alastor Moody.</font>

246
00:23:13,365 --> 00:23:15,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ex-Auror...</font>

247
00:23:16,702 --> 00:23:19,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ministry malcontent...</font>

248
00:23:19,338 --> 00:23:21,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">and your new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.</font>

249
00:23:21,907 --> 00:23:26,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am here because Dumbledore asked me.
End of story, goodbye, the end.</font>

250
00:23:26,546 --> 00:23:28,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any questions?</font>

251
00:23:31,483 --> 00:23:33,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">When it comes to the Dark Arts...</font>

252
00:23:34,586 --> 00:23:37,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe in a practical approach.</font>

253
00:23:37,423 --> 00:23:43,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">But first, which of you can tell me
how many Unforgivable Curses there are?</font>

254
00:23:43,663 --> 00:23:46,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Three, sir.
- And they are so named?</font>

255
00:23:46,165 --> 00:23:49,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because they are unforgivable.
The use of any one of them will...</font>

256
00:23:49,568 --> 00:23:53,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will earn you a one-way ticket
to Azkaban, correct.</font>

257
00:23:53,873 --> 00:23:56,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Ministry says you're too young
to see what these curses do.</font>

258
00:23:56,776 --> 00:24:00,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">I say different! You need to know
what you're up against!</font>

259
00:24:00,413 --> 00:24:02,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need to be prepared.</font>

260
00:24:02,749 --> 00:24:05,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need to find another place
to put your chewing gum...</font>

261
00:24:05,384 --> 00:24:07,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">besides the underside of your desk,
Mr. Finnigan!</font>

262
00:24:07,854 --> 00:24:11,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">No way. The old codger
can see out the back of his head.</font>

263
00:24:11,557 --> 00:24:13,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">And hear across classrooms!</font>

264
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:19,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">So which curse shall we see first?</font>

265
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:20,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Weasley!
- Yes?</font>

266
00:24:20,733 --> 00:24:22,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stand.</font>

267
00:24:25,238 --> 00:24:27,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give us a curse.</font>

268
00:24:27,173 --> 00:24:31,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, my dad did tell me about one.</font>

269
00:24:31,611 --> 00:24:33,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Imperius Curse.</font>

270
00:24:33,046 --> 00:24:36,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah, your father
would know all about that.</font>

271
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:39,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gave the Ministry quite a bit of grief
a few years ago.</font>

272
00:24:39,885 --> 00:24:42,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps this will show you why.</font>

273
00:24:49,996 --> 00:24:51,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello.</font>

274
00:24:52,965 --> 00:24:54,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lovely little beauty.</font>

275
00:24:57,804 --> 00:25:00,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">Engorgio.</font>

276
00:25:00,173 --> 00:25:02,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">Imperio!</font>

277
00:25:06,246 --> 00:25:08,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry. It's completely harmless.</font>

278
00:25:14,854 --> 00:25:16,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">If she bites...</font>

279
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:18,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">she's lethal.</font>

280
00:25:21,094 --> 00:25:23,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you laughing at?</font>

281
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:25,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get off!</font>

282
00:25:28,101 --> 00:25:30,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">Talented, isn't she?</font>

283
00:25:30,036 --> 00:25:33,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">What should I have her do next?
Jump out the window?</font>

284
00:25:35,407 --> 00:25:37,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drown herself?</font>

285
00:25:48,587 --> 00:25:52,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">Scores of witches and wizards
have claimed...</font>

286
00:25:52,025 --> 00:25:56,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">that they only did
You-Know-Who's bidding...</font>

287
00:25:56,195 --> 00:25:58,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">under the influence
of the Imperius Curse.</font>

288
00:25:58,597 --> 00:26:00,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">But here's the rub:</font>

289
00:26:00,866 --> 00:26:04,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do we sort out the liars?</font>

290
00:26:06,205 --> 00:26:08,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">Another, another.</font>

291
00:26:08,907 --> 00:26:10,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">Up, up. Come on.</font>

292
00:26:10,609 --> 00:26:12,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">Longbottom, is it?</font>

293
00:26:12,846 --> 00:26:14,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">Up.</font>

294
00:26:16,382 --> 00:26:20,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Sprout tells me
you have an aptitude for herbology.</font>

295
00:26:22,154 --> 00:26:24,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's the...</font>

296
00:26:24,022 --> 00:26:26,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Cruciatus Curse.</font>

297
00:26:26,125 --> 00:26:29,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">Correct, correct. Come, come.</font>

298
00:26:29,194 --> 00:26:31,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">Particularly nasty.</font>

299
00:26:33,866 --> 00:26:35,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">The torture curse.</font>

300
00:26:36,702 --> 00:26:39,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">Crucio!</font>

301
00:26:51,584 --> 00:26:55,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop it! Can't you see
it's bothering him? Stop it!</font>

302
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:17,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps you could give us the last
Unforgivable Curse, Miss Granger.</font>

303
00:27:19,444 --> 00:27:21,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">No?</font>

304
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:24,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">Avada Kedavra!</font>

305
00:27:27,886 --> 00:27:29,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Killing Curse.</font>

306
00:27:30,557 --> 00:27:33,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only one person is known
to have survived it...</font>

307
00:27:34,259 --> 00:27:36,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he's sitting in this room.</font>

308
00:28:08,227 --> 00:28:10,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brilliant, isn't he?</font>

309
00:28:10,163 --> 00:28:14,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Completely demented, of course, and
terrifying to be in the same room with...</font>

310
00:28:14,366 --> 00:28:17,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">but he's really been there, you know?
He's looked evil in the eye.</font>

311
00:28:17,703 --> 00:28:20,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a reason those curses
are unforgivable.</font>

312
00:28:20,472 --> 00:28:24,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">To perform them in a classroom...
I mean, did you see Neville's face?</font>

313
00:28:27,512 --> 00:28:29,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">Neville?</font>

314
00:28:29,147 --> 00:28:30,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">Son?</font>

315
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:32,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">You all right?</font>

316
00:28:33,552 --> 00:28:37,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on. We'll have a cup of tea.
I want to show you something.</font>

317
00:28:51,471 --> 00:28:53,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna be late!</font>

318
00:29:07,053 --> 00:29:09,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, Cedric. Put it in!</font>

319
00:29:25,003 --> 00:29:27,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eternal glory. Be brilliant, wouldn't it?</font>

320
00:29:27,673 --> 00:29:30,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three years from now,
when we're old enough to be chosen.</font>

321
00:29:30,476 --> 00:29:32,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, rather you than me.</font>

322
00:29:32,278 --> 00:29:34,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes!</font>

323
00:29:36,415 --> 00:29:38,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, thank you.</font>

324
00:29:38,483 --> 00:29:41,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, lads, we've done it.
- Cooked it up just this morning.</font>

325
00:29:41,721 --> 00:29:44,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not going to work.</font>

326
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:47,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, yeah?
- And why is that, Granger?</font>

327
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:50,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see this? This is an Age Line.</font>

328
00:29:50,896 --> 00:29:52,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dumbledore drew it himself.</font>

329
00:29:52,865 --> 00:29:54,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">So?</font>

330
00:29:55,902 --> 00:29:59,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">So a genius like Dumbledore
couldn't possibly be fooled...</font>

331
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:02,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">by a dodge as pathetically dimwitted
as an Aging Potion.</font>

332
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:07,357
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But that's why it's so brilliant.
- Because it's so pathetically dimwitted.</font>

333
00:30:08,847 --> 00:30:11,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ready, Fred?
- Ready, George.</font>

334
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:13,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Bottoms up.
- Bottoms up.</font>

335
00:30:16,288 --> 00:30:18,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes!
- Yes!</font>

336
00:30:19,057 --> 00:30:20,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah!</font>

337
00:30:21,693 --> 00:30:23,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes!</font>

338
00:30:23,762 --> 00:30:25,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ready?</font>

339
00:30:28,567 --> 00:30:30,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes!
- Yes!</font>

340
00:30:39,244 --> 00:30:41,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You said!
- You said!</font>

341
00:30:42,181 --> 00:30:45,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, right, you want a piece of me?
- I'll tear your ears off!</font>

342
00:30:45,785 --> 00:30:48,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Now you're making me laugh.
- Take this! Come on!</font>

343
00:30:48,453 --> 00:30:50,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fight! Fight! Fight!</font>

344
00:30:54,993 --> 00:30:56,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're "old school," right?</font>

345
00:30:56,895 --> 00:30:59,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but you look older!</font>

346
00:31:30,663 --> 00:31:33,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sit down. Please.</font>

347
00:31:36,736 --> 00:31:39,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now the moment
you've all been waiting for:</font>

348
00:31:39,771 --> 00:31:42,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">The champion selection.</font>

349
00:32:13,338 --> 00:32:17,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Durmstrang champion
is Viktor Krum.</font>

350
00:32:33,092 --> 00:32:35,660
<font color="#FFFFFF">The champion for Beauxbatons...</font>

351
00:32:35,661 --> 00:32:37,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">is Fleur Delacour.</font>

352
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,482
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Hogwarts champion, Cedric Diggory!</font>

353
00:33:01,287 --> 00:33:05,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excellent! We now have
our three champions.</font>

354
00:33:05,857 --> 00:33:10,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">But in the end,
only one will go down in history.</font>

355
00:33:10,229 --> 00:33:13,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only one will hoist
this chalice of champions...</font>

356
00:33:13,865 --> 00:33:17,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">this vessel of victory...</font>

357
00:33:17,068 --> 00:33:19,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">the Triwizard Cup!</font>

358
00:33:50,036 --> 00:33:51,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry Potter.</font>

359
00:33:53,806 --> 00:33:55,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry Potter?</font>

360
00:33:59,811 --> 00:34:02,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No.</font>

361
00:34:02,515 --> 00:34:04,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry Potter!</font>

362
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on, Harry.</font>

363
00:34:05,917 --> 00:34:07,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry, for goodness sake.</font>

364
00:34:39,184 --> 00:34:40,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a cheat!</font>

365
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not even 17 yet!</font>

366
00:35:11,349 --> 00:35:15,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's wrong, I tell you!
- You French tart.</font>

367
00:35:15,021 --> 00:35:18,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Everything is a conspiracy theory
with you! - Quiet! I can't think!</font>

368
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:20,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Everything is a conspiracy theory!
- I protest.</font>

369
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:21,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Harry.
- I protest!</font>

370
00:35:21,693 --> 00:35:23,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you put your name
in the Goblet of Fire?</font>

371
00:35:23,728 --> 00:35:26,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, sir.
- Did you ask one of the older students...</font>

372
00:35:26,065 --> 00:35:27,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">to do it for you?
- No, sir.</font>

373
00:35:27,565 --> 00:35:30,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're absolutely sure?
- Yes. Yes, sir.</font>

374
00:35:30,902 --> 00:35:33,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But of course he is lying.
- The hell he is!</font>

375
00:35:33,338 --> 00:35:35,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Goblet of Fire is an exceptionally
powerful magical object.</font>

376
00:35:35,875 --> 00:35:39,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only an exceptionally powerful
Confundus Charm could have hoodwinked it.</font>

377
00:35:39,177 --> 00:35:41,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Magic way beyond the talents
of a fourth year.</font>

378
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:44,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">You seem to have given this
a fair bit of thought, Mad-Eye.</font>

379
00:35:44,516 --> 00:35:47,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was once my job to think
as dark wizards do, Karkaroff...</font>

380
00:35:47,853 --> 00:35:51,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">perhaps you remember.
- This doesn't help, Alastor.</font>

381
00:35:52,724 --> 00:35:55,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leave this to you, Barty.</font>

382
00:35:56,394 --> 00:35:58,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">The rules are absolute.</font>

383
00:35:59,798 --> 00:36:03,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Goblet of Fire constitutes
a binding magical contract.</font>

384
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:07,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Potter has no choice.</font>

385
00:36:08,074 --> 00:36:10,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">He is, as of tonight...</font>

386
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:14,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">a Triwizard champion.</font>

387
00:36:42,173 --> 00:36:44,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">This can't go on, Albus.</font>

388
00:36:44,643 --> 00:36:47,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">First the Dark Mark. Now this?</font>

389
00:36:47,646 --> 00:36:49,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you suggest, Minerva?</font>

390
00:36:50,815 --> 00:36:53,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put an end to it.</font>

391
00:36:53,351 --> 00:36:55,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't let Potter compete.</font>

392
00:36:55,521 --> 00:36:58,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">You heard Barty. The rules are clear.</font>

393
00:36:58,157 --> 00:37:01,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, the devil with Barty
and his rules.</font>

394
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:03,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">And since when did you
accommodate the Ministry?</font>

395
00:37:03,762 --> 00:37:07,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">Headmaster, I, too, find it difficult
to believe this mere coincidence.</font>

396
00:37:07,932 --> 00:37:12,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">However, if we are to truly discover
the meaning of these events...</font>

397
00:37:12,036 --> 00:37:15,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">perhaps we should,
for the time being...</font>

398
00:37:16,541 --> 00:37:18,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">let them unfold.</font>

399
00:37:18,978 --> 00:37:21,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">What...? Do nothing?</font>

400
00:37:21,313 --> 00:37:23,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Offer him up as bait?</font>

401
00:37:23,949 --> 00:37:27,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">Potter is a boy, not a piece of meat.</font>

402
00:37:27,686 --> 00:37:30,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">I agree. With Severus.</font>

403
00:37:30,989 --> 00:37:34,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alastor, keep an eye on Harry, will you?</font>

404
00:37:34,092 --> 00:37:36,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I can do that.
- Don't let him know, though.</font>

405
00:37:36,829 --> 00:37:40,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">He must be anxious enough as it is...</font>

406
00:37:40,465 --> 00:37:43,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">knowing what lies ahead.</font>

407
00:37:43,501 --> 00:37:46,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then again, we all are.</font>

408
00:38:00,952 --> 00:38:03,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did you do it?</font>

409
00:38:04,222 --> 00:38:09,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never mind. Doesn't matter.
Might've let your best friend know, though.</font>

410
00:38:09,027 --> 00:38:12,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let you know what?
- You know bloody well what.</font>

411
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:15,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't ask for this to happen, Ron.</font>

412
00:38:15,367 --> 00:38:17,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay?</font>

413
00:38:17,135 --> 00:38:19,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're being stupid.
- Yeah, that's me.</font>

414
00:38:19,804 --> 00:38:23,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ron Weasley,
Harry Potter's stupid friend.</font>

415
00:38:27,045 --> 00:38:29,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't put my name in that cup.</font>

416
00:38:29,447 --> 00:38:33,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want eternal glory.
I just wanna be...</font>

417
00:38:35,054 --> 00:38:39,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I don't know what happened tonight,
and I don't know why.</font>

418
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:41,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">It just did.</font>

419
00:38:41,793 --> 00:38:43,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay?</font>

420
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:54,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">Piss off.</font>

421
00:39:08,954 --> 00:39:11,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">What a charismatic quartet.</font>

422
00:39:12,757 --> 00:39:14,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello.</font>

423
00:39:15,226 --> 00:39:18,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Rita Skeeter.</font>

424
00:39:18,364 --> 00:39:21,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">I write for the Daily Prophet.</font>

425
00:39:21,467 --> 00:39:26,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">But of course you know that, don't you?
It's you we don't know.</font>

426
00:39:26,704 --> 00:39:28,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the juicy news.</font>

427
00:39:28,706 --> 00:39:33,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">What quirks lurk
beneath those rosy cheeks?</font>

428
00:39:33,112 --> 00:39:36,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">What mysteries do the muscles mask?</font>

429
00:39:36,748 --> 00:39:40,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does courage lie beneath those curls?</font>

430
00:39:40,152 --> 00:39:43,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">In short, what makes a champion tick?</font>

431
00:39:43,688 --> 00:39:48,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Me, Myself & I" want to know.
Not to mention my rabid readers.</font>

432
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:50,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">So who's feeling up to sharing?</font>

433
00:39:53,965 --> 00:39:56,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shall we start with the youngest?
Lovely.</font>

434
00:40:08,847 --> 00:40:10,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is cozy.</font>

435
00:40:11,215 --> 00:40:13,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a broom cupboard.</font>

436
00:40:13,284 --> 00:40:15,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should feel right at home, then.</font>

437
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:18,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't mind if I use
a Quick-Quotes Quill, do you?</font>

438
00:40:18,724 --> 00:40:20,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

439
00:40:20,659 --> 00:40:22,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">So tell me, Harry.</font>

440
00:40:22,827 --> 00:40:25,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here you sit, a mere boy of 12...</font>

441
00:40:25,898 --> 00:40:27,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm 14. Sorry.</font>

442
00:40:27,565 --> 00:40:30,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">- About to compete
against three students...</font>

443
00:40:30,702 --> 00:40:34,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">not only vastly more
emotionally mature than yourself...</font>

444
00:40:34,139 --> 00:40:36,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">but who have mastered spells
that you wouldn't attempt...</font>

445
00:40:36,909 --> 00:40:39,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">in your dizziest daydreams.</font>

446
00:40:39,744 --> 00:40:42,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Concerned?</font>

447
00:40:42,947 --> 00:40:45,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.
I haven't really thought about it.</font>

448
00:40:45,951 --> 00:40:48,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just ignore the quill.</font>

449
00:40:48,286 --> 00:40:50,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then, of course,
you're no ordinary boy of 12, are you?</font>

450
00:40:50,989 --> 00:40:53,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Fourteen.
- Your story's legend.</font>

451
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think it was
the trauma of your past...</font>

452
00:40:56,695 --> 00:41:00,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">that made you so keen to enter
such a dangerous tournament?</font>

453
00:41:00,099 --> 00:41:02,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I didn't enter.</font>

454
00:41:02,034 --> 00:41:03,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course you didn't.</font>

455
00:41:05,903 --> 00:41:07,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone loves a rebel, Harry.</font>

456
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:11,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Scratch that last.</font>

457
00:41:12,143 --> 00:41:16,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">Speaking of your parents, were they alive,
how do you think they'd feel?</font>

458
00:41:16,481 --> 00:41:18,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">Proud? Or concerned...</font>

459
00:41:18,449 --> 00:41:22,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">that your attitude shows, at best,
a pathological need for attention...</font>

460
00:41:22,454 --> 00:41:25,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">at worst, a psychotic death wish?</font>

461
00:41:26,057 --> 00:41:31,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, my eyes aren't
"glistening with the ghosts of my past. "</font>

462
00:42:03,429 --> 00:42:05,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry, I couldn't risk sending Hedwig.</font>

463
00:42:05,931 --> 00:42:09,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">Since the World Cup, the Ministry's
been intercepting more and more owls...</font>

464
00:42:09,367 --> 00:42:11,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">and she's too easily recognized.</font>

465
00:42:11,769 --> 00:42:14,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to talk, Harry, face-to-face.</font>

466
00:42:14,806 --> 00:42:19,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">Meet me in the Gryffindor common room,
1:00 this Saturday night.</font>

467
00:42:19,143 --> 00:42:21,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">And make sure you're alone.</font>

468
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:22,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sirius.</font>

469
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:24,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">P. S:</font>

470
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:26,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">The bird bites.</font>

471
00:42:36,561 --> 00:42:38,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sirius?</font>

472
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry Potter, age 12...</font>

473
00:42:56,949 --> 00:43:00,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">suspect entrant
in the Triwizard Tournament.</font>

474
00:43:00,085 --> 00:43:02,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">His eyes swimming
with the ghosts of his past...</font>

475
00:43:02,855 --> 00:43:04,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">and choking back tears...</font>

476
00:43:19,905 --> 00:43:22,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sirius. How...?</font>

477
00:43:22,673 --> 00:43:25,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't have much time,
so let me get straight to it.</font>

478
00:43:25,344 --> 00:43:28,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you or did you not put your name
into the Goblet of Fire?</font>

479
00:43:28,447 --> 00:43:30,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

480
00:43:30,516 --> 00:43:31,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had to ask.</font>

481
00:43:31,949 --> 00:43:36,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, tell me about this dream of yours.
You mentioned Wormtail and Voldemort.</font>

482
00:43:36,922 --> 00:43:39,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">But who was the third man in the room?</font>

483
00:43:39,525 --> 00:43:42,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I don't know.
- You didn't hear a name?</font>

484
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:44,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

485
00:43:45,297 --> 00:43:49,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Voldemort was giving him a job to do.
Something important.</font>

486
00:43:49,201 --> 00:43:50,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what was that?</font>

487
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:54,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wanted...</font>

488
00:43:54,472 --> 00:43:56,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">me.</font>

489
00:43:56,708 --> 00:44:01,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know why. But he was
gonna use this man to get to me.</font>

490
00:44:02,313 --> 00:44:04,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, I mean, it was only a dream, right?</font>

491
00:44:04,849 --> 00:44:06,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

492
00:44:06,652 --> 00:44:08,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just a dream.</font>

493
00:44:08,954 --> 00:44:10,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, Harry.</font>

494
00:44:10,556 --> 00:44:14,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Death Eaters at the World Cup,
your name rising from that goblet...</font>

495
00:44:14,192 --> 00:44:18,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">these are not just coincidences.
Hogwarts isn't safe anymore.</font>

496
00:44:18,362 --> 00:44:19,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you saying?</font>

497
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:24,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm saying the devils are inside
the walls. Igor Karkaroff?</font>

498
00:44:24,068 --> 00:44:28,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was a Death Eater. And no one,
no one stops being a Death Eater.</font>

499
00:44:28,907 --> 00:44:34,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then there's Barty Crouch. Heart of stone.
Sent his own son to Azkaban.</font>

500
00:44:38,849 --> 00:44:41,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think one of them
put my name in the goblet?</font>

501
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:43,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">I haven't a clue who put your name
in that goblet...</font>

502
00:44:43,588 --> 00:44:47,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">but whoever did is no friend to you.
People die in this tournament.</font>

503
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:51,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm not ready for this, Sirius.
- You don't have a choice.</font>

504
00:44:54,766 --> 00:44:57,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Someone's coming.
- Keep your friends close, Harry.</font>

505
00:45:00,472 --> 00:45:01,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who were you talking to?</font>

506
00:45:01,974 --> 00:45:05,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What? Who says I was talking to anyone?
- I heard voices.</font>

507
00:45:05,309 --> 00:45:09,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe you're imagining things.
Wouldn't be the first time.</font>

508
00:45:09,847 --> 00:45:13,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're probably just practicing
for your next interview, I expect.</font>

509
00:45:39,110 --> 00:45:40,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">Amazing.</font>

510
00:45:42,713 --> 00:45:46,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Amazing!
- Neville. You're doing it again.</font>

511
00:45:46,985 --> 00:45:48,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right, sorry.</font>

512
00:45:49,253 --> 00:45:52,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Magical Water Plants
of the Highland Lochs"?</font>

513
00:45:52,423 --> 00:45:55,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">Moody gave it to me.
That day we had tea.</font>

514
00:45:57,094 --> 00:45:58,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's already been through enough people.</font>

515
00:45:58,996 --> 00:46:01,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you just go
and talk to him yourself?</font>

516
00:46:02,567 --> 00:46:05,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ron, this is your problem, not mine.</font>

517
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:07,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you want me to say again?</font>

518
00:46:07,338 --> 00:46:08,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go.</font>

519
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:16,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ronald would like me to tell you
that Seamus told him...</font>

520
00:46:16,347 --> 00:46:20,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">that Dean was told by Parvati
that Hagrid's looking for you.</font>

521
00:46:20,117 --> 00:46:22,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that right? Well, you...</font>

522
00:46:22,721 --> 00:46:24,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

523
00:46:28,893 --> 00:46:32,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are you sure you won't do this?
- Do it.</font>

524
00:46:34,632 --> 00:46:37,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dean was told by Parvati that...</font>

525
00:46:38,836 --> 00:46:41,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please don't ask me to say it again.</font>

526
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hagrid's looking for you.</font>

527
00:46:43,407 --> 00:46:46,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, you can tell Ronald...
- I'm not an owl!</font>

528
00:46:57,021 --> 00:46:59,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you bring your father's cloak,
like I asked you?</font>

529
00:46:59,458 --> 00:47:02,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I brought the cloak.
Hagrid, where are we going?</font>

530
00:47:02,226 --> 00:47:03,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll see soon enough.</font>

531
00:47:03,795 --> 00:47:06,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now pay attention, this is important.</font>

532
00:47:07,733 --> 00:47:09,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's with the flower?</font>

533
00:47:10,235 --> 00:47:12,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hagrid, have you combed your hair?</font>

534
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:15,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">As a matter of fact, I have.</font>

535
00:47:15,206 --> 00:47:18,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">You might like to try the same thing
now and again.</font>

536
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:28,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hagrid?</font>

537
00:47:32,023 --> 00:47:34,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">The cloak! Put the cloak on!</font>

538
00:47:40,465 --> 00:47:44,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Bonsoir, Olympe.
- Oh, Hagrid.</font>

539
00:47:44,034 --> 00:47:47,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought perhaps you weren't coming.
I thought perhaps...</font>

540
00:47:47,938 --> 00:47:50,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">you had forgotten me.</font>

541
00:47:50,775 --> 00:47:52,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">Couldn't forget you, Olympe.</font>

542
00:47:53,378 --> 00:47:55,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it you wanted to show me?</font>

543
00:47:56,882 --> 00:48:00,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">When we spoke earlier,
you sounded so...</font>

544
00:48:00,452 --> 00:48:02,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">exhilarated.</font>

545
00:48:02,521 --> 00:48:05,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll be glad you came. Trust me.</font>

546
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:17,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can we get closer?</font>

547
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:27,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dragons?</font>

548
00:48:27,144 --> 00:48:28,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the first task?</font>

549
00:48:29,047 --> 00:48:31,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're joking.
- Come on, Harry.</font>

550
00:48:32,349 --> 00:48:35,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">These are seriously
misunderstood creatures.</font>

551
00:48:36,487 --> 00:48:38,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, crikey!</font>

552
00:48:38,456 --> 00:48:43,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Although, I have to admit, that Horntail
is a right nasty piece of work.</font>

553
00:48:43,762 --> 00:48:46,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">Poor Ron nearly fainted
just seeing him, you know.</font>

554
00:48:48,099 --> 00:48:50,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ron was here?
- Oh, sure.</font>

555
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:54,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">His brother Charlie helped
to bring him over from Romania.</font>

556
00:48:54,005 --> 00:48:55,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">Didn't Ron tell you that?</font>

557
00:48:57,375 --> 00:48:59,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, he didn't.</font>

558
00:48:59,510 --> 00:49:01,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">He didn't tell me a thing.</font>

559
00:49:11,322 --> 00:49:14,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You cheat, Potter.
- You stink, Potter.</font>

560
00:49:15,927 --> 00:49:18,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Good luck, Potter.
- Potter stinks!</font>

561
00:49:18,762 --> 00:49:21,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Cedric rules.
- Thanks.</font>

562
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:24,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like the badge?</font>

563
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:26,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me.</font>

564
00:49:30,641 --> 00:49:32,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry.</font>

565
00:49:32,677 --> 00:49:34,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey! Read the badge, Potter!</font>

566
00:49:34,813 --> 00:49:36,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I have a word?</font>

567
00:49:37,282 --> 00:49:39,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">- All right.
- You stink, Potter!</font>

568
00:49:39,317 --> 00:49:42,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Potter, you stink!
- Harry Potter smells!</font>

569
00:49:44,822 --> 00:49:47,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dragons. That's the first task.</font>

570
00:49:47,559 --> 00:49:50,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">- They've got one for each of us.
- Come on, Ced!</font>

571
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:53,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you serious?</font>

572
00:49:53,664 --> 00:49:56,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Fleur and Krum, do they...?</font>

573
00:49:56,867 --> 00:49:59,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes.
- Come on, Ced, leave him.</font>

574
00:49:59,304 --> 00:50:00,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Right.
- He's not worth it.</font>

575
00:50:00,938 --> 00:50:03,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Read the badges, Potter!
- Hey, listen. About the badges.</font>

576
00:50:03,608 --> 00:50:06,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I've asked them not to wear them, but...
- Don't worry about it.</font>

577
00:50:06,811 --> 00:50:09,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not like I try
to blow things up, exactly.</font>

578
00:50:09,947 --> 00:50:11,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">It just happens a fair bit.</font>

579
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:14,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have to admit, though,
fire's pretty fascinating.</font>

580
00:50:14,818 --> 00:50:16,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a right foul git, you know that?</font>

581
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:19,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You think so?
- I know so.</font>

582
00:50:19,257 --> 00:50:20,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anything else?</font>

583
00:50:20,759 --> 00:50:24,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah. Stay away from me.
- Fine.</font>

584
00:50:26,630 --> 00:50:30,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">- There's Potter. Cheat.
- Why so tense, Potter?</font>

585
00:50:31,001 --> 00:50:33,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father and I have a bet, you see.</font>

586
00:50:33,570 --> 00:50:37,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think you're gonna last
10 minutes in this tournament.</font>

587
00:50:39,344 --> 00:50:42,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">He disagrees.
He thinks you won't last five.</font>

588
00:50:42,447 --> 00:50:45,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't give a damn
what your father thinks, Malfoy.</font>

589
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:50,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's vile and cruel.
And you're just pathetic.</font>

590
00:50:51,456 --> 00:50:54,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Pathetic?
- Oh, no, you don't, sonny!</font>

591
00:50:56,226 --> 00:50:59,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll teach you to curse someone
when their back is turned!</font>

592
00:50:59,297 --> 00:51:03,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">You stinking, cowardly, scummy...</font>

593
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:05,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Professor Moody!
back-shooting...</font>

594
00:51:05,202 --> 00:51:08,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What are you doing?
- Teaching.</font>

595
00:51:09,139 --> 00:51:13,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is that a...? Is that a student?
- Technically, it's a ferret.</font>

596
00:51:18,916 --> 00:51:21,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stand still! Stand still!</font>

597
00:51:31,829 --> 00:51:34,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">- My father will hear about this!
- Is that a threat?</font>

598
00:51:34,199 --> 00:51:36,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Professor Moody!
- Is that a threat?</font>

599
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:38,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor!</font>

600
00:51:38,335 --> 00:51:42,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could tell you stories about your father
that would curl even your greasy hair!</font>

601
00:51:42,072 --> 00:51:44,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Alastor! Alastor.
- It doesn't end here!</font>

602
00:51:44,943 --> 00:51:48,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">We never use transfiguration
as a punishment!</font>

603
00:51:48,913 --> 00:51:51,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Surely Dumbledore told you that.</font>

604
00:51:51,648 --> 00:51:56,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He might've mentioned it.
- Well, you will do well to remember it.</font>

605
00:51:57,222 --> 00:51:58,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">Away!</font>

606
00:52:01,793 --> 00:52:04,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">You. Come with me.</font>

607
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:41,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a Foe-Glass.</font>

608
00:52:42,032 --> 00:52:44,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lets me keep an eye on my enemies.</font>

609
00:52:44,601 --> 00:52:49,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I can see the whites of their eyes,
they're standing right behind me.</font>

610
00:52:53,177 --> 00:52:55,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wouldn't even bother telling you
what's in there.</font>

611
00:52:55,813 --> 00:52:58,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wouldn't believe it if I did.</font>

612
00:52:58,115 --> 00:53:00,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now...</font>

613
00:53:01,485 --> 00:53:04,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">what are you going to do
about your dragon?</font>

614
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:10,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you know, I just thought I'd...</font>

615
00:53:11,996 --> 00:53:13,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sit.</font>

616
00:53:17,202 --> 00:53:18,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen to me, Potter.</font>

617
00:53:19,603 --> 00:53:20,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your pal Diggory?</font>

618
00:53:20,938 --> 00:53:25,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">By your age, he could turn a whistle
into a watch and have it sing you the time.</font>

619
00:53:26,543 --> 00:53:28,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">Miss Delacour?</font>

620
00:53:28,213 --> 00:53:31,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's as much a fairy princess as I am.</font>

621
00:53:31,449 --> 00:53:35,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">As for Krum, his head
may be filled with sawdust...</font>

622
00:53:35,186 --> 00:53:37,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">but Karkaroff's is not.</font>

623
00:53:37,521 --> 00:53:39,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'll have a strategy.</font>

624
00:53:39,523 --> 00:53:43,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you can bet that it will
play to Krum's strengths.</font>

625
00:53:47,831 --> 00:53:49,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, Potter.</font>

626
00:53:49,567 --> 00:53:51,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are your strengths?</font>

627
00:53:53,237 --> 00:53:54,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

628
00:53:54,771 --> 00:53:57,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I can fly.
I mean, I'm a fair flyer. But I...</font>

629
00:53:57,742 --> 00:54:01,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Better than fair, the way I heard it.
- But I'm not allowed a broom.</font>

630
00:54:01,945 --> 00:54:05,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're allowed a wand.</font>

631
00:54:12,023 --> 00:54:13,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bets! Place your bets!</font>

632
00:54:13,657 --> 00:54:15,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bets taken! Bets taken here!</font>

633
00:54:15,994 --> 00:54:19,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">Step up, folks! Who fancies a flutter
in today's bloodbath?</font>

634
00:54:19,097 --> 00:54:22,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">Smart money's on Krum to survive!
Any bets?</font>

635
00:54:22,132 --> 00:54:23,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, sir?</font>

636
00:54:23,967 --> 00:54:26,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ten-to-1 for Fleur. There you go.
Thank you very much.</font>

637
00:54:27,204 --> 00:54:29,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your attention, please.</font>

638
00:54:29,373 --> 00:54:32,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a great day for all of us.</font>

639
00:54:35,413 --> 00:54:39,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">Each of the three tasks involves
very considerable danger.</font>

640
00:54:39,817 --> 00:54:42,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please keep your seats at all times.</font>

641
00:54:42,686 --> 00:54:45,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">This will minimize any risks
you may be exposed to.</font>

642
00:54:45,590 --> 00:54:49,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Harry? Is that you?
- Yeah.</font>

643
00:54:49,193 --> 00:54:51,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure we all wish our champions...</font>

644
00:54:51,061 --> 00:54:54,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How are you feeling? Okay?
- ... the greatest of luck.</font>

645
00:54:56,434 --> 00:55:00,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">The key is to concentrate.
After that, you just have to...</font>

646
00:55:00,003 --> 00:55:02,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">Battle a dragon.</font>

647
00:55:06,143 --> 00:55:08,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">Young love.</font>

648
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:10,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">How...</font>

649
00:55:13,083 --> 00:55:14,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">stirring.</font>

650
00:55:17,054 --> 00:55:20,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">If everything goes unfortunately today...</font>

651
00:55:20,391 --> 00:55:23,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">you two may even
make the front page.</font>

652
00:55:23,327 --> 00:55:25,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have no business here.</font>

653
00:55:25,730 --> 00:55:28,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">This tent is for champions...</font>

654
00:55:28,099 --> 00:55:30,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">and friends.</font>

655
00:55:32,603 --> 00:55:37,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">No matter. We've got what we wanted.</font>

656
00:55:39,911 --> 00:55:42,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good day, champions.
Gather round, please.</font>

657
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:47,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, you've waited, you've wondered,
and at last the moment has arrived.</font>

658
00:55:47,251 --> 00:55:50,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">A moment only four of you
can fully appreciate.</font>

659
00:55:50,655 --> 00:55:53,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing here, Miss Granger?</font>

660
00:55:54,092 --> 00:55:55,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, I'll just go.</font>

661
00:55:55,927 --> 00:55:57,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">Barty, the bag.</font>

662
00:55:57,894 --> 00:56:00,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">Champions, in a circle around me.</font>

663
00:56:00,297 --> 00:56:03,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Miss Delacour, over here. Mr. Krum.</font>

664
00:56:03,568 --> 00:56:07,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">And, Potter, Mr. Potter, over here.
That's right. Now...</font>

665
00:56:07,672 --> 00:56:10,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">Miss Delacour, if you will.</font>

666
00:56:14,177 --> 00:56:16,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Welsh Green.</font>

667
00:56:20,485 --> 00:56:22,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Krum.</font>

668
00:56:24,789 --> 00:56:26,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Chinese Fireball.</font>

669
00:56:33,164 --> 00:56:35,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Swedish Short-Snout.</font>

670
00:56:36,034 --> 00:56:38,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Which leaves...
- The Horntail.</font>

671
00:56:38,202 --> 00:56:40,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's that, boy?
- Nothing.</font>

672
00:56:43,875 --> 00:56:46,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Hungarian Horntail.</font>

673
00:56:48,445 --> 00:56:51,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">These represent four
very real dragons...</font>

674
00:56:51,748 --> 00:56:54,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">each of which has been given
a golden egg to protect.</font>

675
00:56:54,985 --> 00:56:57,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your objective is simple:</font>

676
00:56:57,621 --> 00:56:59,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Collect the egg.</font>

677
00:56:59,289 --> 00:57:02,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">This you must do,
for each egg contains a clue...</font>

678
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:06,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">without which you cannot hope
to proceed to the next task.</font>

679
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:07,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any questions?</font>

680
00:57:08,498 --> 00:57:11,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very well. Good luck, champions.</font>

681
00:57:11,335 --> 00:57:14,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Diggory, at the sound of the cannon,
you may...</font>

682
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:26,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">Diggory! Diggory! Diggory!</font>

683
00:57:38,195 --> 00:57:41,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three of our champions
have now faced their dragons...</font>

684
00:57:41,733 --> 00:57:45,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">and so each one of them
will proceed to the next task.</font>

685
00:57:45,802 --> 00:57:49,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now our fourth and final contestant.</font>

686
00:57:50,875 --> 00:57:54,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry! Harry! Harry!</font>

687
00:59:01,545 --> 00:59:04,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your wand, Harry! Your wand!</font>

688
00:59:04,981 --> 00:59:07,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">Accio Firebolt!</font>

689
00:59:36,012 --> 00:59:38,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah!
- Yes!</font>

690
00:59:47,090 --> 00:59:48,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

691
00:59:58,168 --> 01:00:01,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah!
- Yeah! Well done, dragon!</font>

692
01:02:33,456 --> 01:02:35,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes! Yes!</font>

693
01:02:58,849 --> 01:03:01,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes, Harry!
- Knew you wouldn't die, Harry. Lose a leg.</font>

694
01:03:01,719 --> 01:03:03,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Or an arm.
- Pack it in altogether?</font>

695
01:03:03,820 --> 01:03:05,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Never!
- Never!</font>

696
01:03:07,692 --> 01:03:09,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shush!</font>

697
01:03:09,492 --> 01:03:12,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on, Harry. What's the clue?</font>

698
01:03:13,197 --> 01:03:16,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who wants me to open it?
- Yes!</font>

699
01:03:16,833 --> 01:03:19,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do you want me to open it?
- Yes!</font>

700
01:03:30,547 --> 01:03:33,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the bloody hell was that?</font>

701
01:03:37,088 --> 01:03:39,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, everyone!
Go back to your knitting.</font>

702
01:03:39,989 --> 01:03:44,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is gonna be uncomfortable enough
without all you nosy sods listening in.</font>

703
01:03:47,197 --> 01:03:51,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">I reckon you have to be barking mad
to put your own name in the Goblet of Fire.</font>

704
01:03:51,534 --> 01:03:54,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Caught on, have you?
Took you long enough.</font>

705
01:03:55,405 --> 01:03:57,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wasn't the only one
who thought you'd done it.</font>

706
01:03:57,675 --> 01:04:00,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone was saying it behind your back.</font>

707
01:04:02,146 --> 01:04:05,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brilliant. That makes me
feel loads better.</font>

708
01:04:06,317 --> 01:04:09,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Least I warned you about the dragons.
- Hagrid warned me about the dragons.</font>

709
01:04:09,887 --> 01:04:11,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no, I did.</font>

710
01:04:11,521 --> 01:04:14,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, don't you remember?
I told Hermione to tell you...</font>

711
01:04:14,724 --> 01:04:18,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">that Seamus told me that Parvati
told Dean that Hagrid was looking for you.</font>

712
01:04:18,963 --> 01:04:23,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seamus never actually told me anything,
so it was really me all along.</font>

713
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:27,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought we'd be all right, you know...</font>

714
01:04:27,137 --> 01:04:29,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">after you'd figured that out.</font>

715
01:04:29,507 --> 01:04:32,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who...? Who could possibly
figure that out?</font>

716
01:04:32,842 --> 01:04:34,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's completely mental.</font>

717
01:04:34,445 --> 01:04:37,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Isn't it?</font>

718
01:04:37,648 --> 01:04:39,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">I suppose I was a bit distraught.</font>

719
01:04:42,286 --> 01:04:44,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boys.</font>

720
01:05:08,445 --> 01:05:10,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hi, Harry.
- Hi, Harry.</font>

721
01:05:13,516 --> 01:05:16,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cho, Harry's looking at you.</font>

722
01:05:20,056 --> 01:05:22,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shush.</font>

723
01:05:22,458 --> 01:05:24,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at this!</font>

724
01:05:25,829 --> 01:05:28,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't believe it! She's done it again.</font>

725
01:05:29,365 --> 01:05:31,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Miss Granger,
a plain but ambitious girl...</font>

726
01:05:31,768 --> 01:05:34,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">seems to be developing a taste
for famous wizards.</font>

727
01:05:34,704 --> 01:05:37,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her latest prey, sources report...</font>

728
01:05:37,141 --> 01:05:41,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">is none other than the
Bulgarian bonbon, Viktor Krum.</font>

729
01:05:41,077 --> 01:05:45,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">No word yet on how Harry Potter's
taking this latest emotional blow. "</font>

730
01:05:46,382 --> 01:05:48,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">Parcel for you, Mr. Weasley.</font>

731
01:05:48,485 --> 01:05:50,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, Nigel.</font>

732
01:05:54,791 --> 01:05:57,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not now, Nigel. Later.</font>

733
01:05:59,463 --> 01:06:01,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on.</font>

734
01:06:06,336 --> 01:06:09,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told him I'd get him Harry's autograph.</font>

735
01:06:11,307 --> 01:06:13,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, look, Mum's sent me something.</font>

736
01:06:21,217 --> 01:06:23,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mum sent me a dress.</font>

737
01:06:23,219 --> 01:06:27,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it does match your eyes.
Is there a bonnet?</font>

738
01:06:27,490 --> 01:06:29,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nose down, Harry.</font>

739
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:34,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ginny, these must be for you.
- I'm not wearing that, it's ghastly.</font>

740
01:06:35,565 --> 01:06:37,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you on about?</font>

741
01:06:37,568 --> 01:06:39,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're not for Ginny.</font>

742
01:06:39,670 --> 01:06:41,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're for you.</font>

743
01:06:42,039 --> 01:06:46,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Dress robes.
- Dress robes? For what?</font>

744
01:06:47,043 --> 01:06:49,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Yule Ball...</font>

745
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:54,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">has been a tradition
of the Triwizard Tournament...</font>

746
01:06:55,452 --> 01:06:57,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">since its inception.</font>

747
01:06:58,188 --> 01:07:02,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">On Christmas Eve night,
we and our guests...</font>

748
01:07:02,226 --> 01:07:04,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">gather in the Great Hall...</font>

749
01:07:04,061 --> 01:07:08,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">for a night of well-mannered frivolity.</font>

750
01:07:09,666 --> 01:07:12,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">As representatives of the host school...</font>

751
01:07:12,101 --> 01:07:17,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">I expect each and every one of you
to put your best foot forward.</font>

752
01:07:17,507 --> 01:07:20,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I mean this literally, because...</font>

753
01:07:20,311 --> 01:07:24,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">the Yule Ball is, first and foremost...</font>

754
01:07:25,615 --> 01:07:27,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">a dance.</font>

755
01:07:31,355 --> 01:07:33,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">Silence!</font>

756
01:07:33,356 --> 01:07:36,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">The house of Godric Gryffindor
has commanded the respect...</font>

757
01:07:36,527 --> 01:07:39,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">of the wizard world
for nearly 10 centuries.</font>

758
01:07:39,329 --> 01:07:43,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will not have you, in the course of
a single evening, besmirching that name...</font>

759
01:07:43,567 --> 01:07:48,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">by behaving like a babbling,
bumbling band of baboons.</font>

760
01:07:48,505 --> 01:07:50,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Try saying that five times fast, huh?</font>

761
01:07:50,641 --> 01:07:52,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, to dance...</font>

762
01:07:52,309 --> 01:07:56,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">is to let the body breathe.</font>

763
01:07:56,179 --> 01:07:59,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">Inside every girl,
a secret swan slumbers...</font>

764
01:07:59,682 --> 01:08:02,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">longing to burst forth and take flight.</font>

765
01:08:02,219 --> 01:08:06,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something's about to burst out of Eloise
Midgen, but I don't think it's a swan.</font>

766
01:08:06,389 --> 01:08:09,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Inside every boy,
a lordly lion prepared to prance.</font>

767
01:08:09,693 --> 01:08:12,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mr. Weasley.
- Yes?</font>

768
01:08:12,096 --> 01:08:14,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you join me, please?</font>

769
01:08:19,136 --> 01:08:22,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, place your right hand on my waist.</font>

770
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:25,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where?
- My waist.</font>

771
01:08:25,576 --> 01:08:28,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">And extend your arm.</font>

772
01:08:28,578 --> 01:08:30,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Filch, if you please.</font>

773
01:08:33,617 --> 01:08:35,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">One, two, three.</font>

774
01:08:35,786 --> 01:08:39,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">One, two, three. One, two, three.</font>

775
01:08:42,993 --> 01:08:45,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never gonna let him forget this, are you?</font>

776
01:08:45,295 --> 01:08:46,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Never.
- Never.</font>

777
01:08:46,630 --> 01:08:50,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody come together.
Boys, on your feet!</font>

778
01:09:13,590 --> 01:09:15,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do they have to travel in packs?</font>

779
01:09:15,692 --> 01:09:18,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">How are you supposed to get one
on their own to ask them?</font>

780
01:09:26,203 --> 01:09:29,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blimey, Harry. You've slayed dragons.
If you can't get a date, who can?</font>

781
01:09:29,872 --> 01:09:32,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I'd take the dragon right now.</font>

782
01:09:38,347 --> 01:09:40,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">I take after my mum.</font>

783
01:09:40,083 --> 01:09:44,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">Though I didn't know her very well.
She left when I was about 3.</font>

784
01:09:44,188 --> 01:09:46,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, not the maternal sort, her.</font>

785
01:09:46,289 --> 01:09:50,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">Broke me dad's heart, though.
He was a tiny little fella, my dad.</font>

786
01:09:50,027 --> 01:09:54,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could pick him up at the age of 6 with
one hand and put him up on the dresser.</font>

787
01:09:54,730 --> 01:09:57,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">He laughed so hard at that.</font>

788
01:09:59,136 --> 01:10:01,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very funny.</font>

789
01:10:06,944 --> 01:10:10,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then he died
just when I started school, so...</font>

790
01:10:10,847 --> 01:10:14,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I sort of had to make
me own way, as it were.</font>

791
01:10:14,318 --> 01:10:16,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">But enough of me. What about you?</font>

792
01:10:33,737 --> 01:10:39,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is mad. At this rate, we'll be
the only ones in our year without dates.</font>

793
01:10:41,110 --> 01:10:44,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, us and Neville.</font>

794
01:10:44,014 --> 01:10:46,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but, then again,
he can take himself.</font>

795
01:10:47,417 --> 01:10:51,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">It might interest you to know
that Neville's already got someone.</font>

796
01:10:53,222 --> 01:10:55,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now I'm really depressed.</font>

797
01:11:00,831 --> 01:11:04,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Get a move on or all the good ones
will have gone. "</font>

798
01:11:06,336 --> 01:11:08,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who you going with, then?</font>

799
01:11:11,041 --> 01:11:12,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oi, Angelina?
- What?</font>

800
01:11:12,909 --> 01:11:18,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you wanna go to the ball with me?</font>

801
01:11:18,548 --> 01:11:20,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">To the ball?</font>

802
01:11:20,449 --> 01:11:22,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, all right.</font>

803
01:11:25,622 --> 01:11:27,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oi, Hermione.</font>

804
01:11:27,356 --> 01:11:29,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a girl.</font>

805
01:11:29,158 --> 01:11:30,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very well spotted.</font>

806
01:11:30,661 --> 01:11:32,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come with one of us?</font>

807
01:11:37,234 --> 01:11:40,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on. It's one thing for a bloke
to show up alone.</font>

808
01:11:40,304 --> 01:11:41,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">For a girl, it's just sad.</font>

809
01:11:41,971 --> 01:11:45,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">I won't be going alone, because,
believe it or not, someone's asked me!</font>

810
01:11:52,682 --> 01:11:54,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I said yes!</font>

811
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:58,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bloody hell.</font>

812
01:11:58,287 --> 01:12:00,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's lying, right?</font>

813
01:12:00,122 --> 01:12:01,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you say so.</font>

814
01:12:02,059 --> 01:12:05,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, we've just gotta
grit our teeth and do it.</font>

815
01:12:05,529 --> 01:12:09,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tonight, when we get back to the common
room, we'll both have partners. Agreed?</font>

816
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:11,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">Agreed.</font>

817
01:12:35,524 --> 01:12:37,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Cho!
- Harry!</font>

818
01:12:40,430 --> 01:12:43,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">Watch yourself on the stairs.
It's a bit icy at the top.</font>

819
01:12:43,332 --> 01:12:45,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, thanks.</font>

820
01:12:49,372 --> 01:12:50,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cho?</font>

821
01:12:51,375 --> 01:12:53,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes?</font>

822
01:12:54,310 --> 01:12:56,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I just wondered if you...</font>

823
01:12:56,712 --> 01:12:59,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wondered if maybe
you wanted to go to the ball with me.</font>

824
01:13:01,184 --> 01:13:03,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, I didn't catch that.</font>

825
01:13:04,354 --> 01:13:09,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was just wondering if maybe
you wanted to go to the ball with me.</font>

826
01:13:15,298 --> 01:13:17,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry...</font>

827
01:13:17,033 --> 01:13:20,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, but someone's
already asked me.</font>

828
01:13:20,871 --> 01:13:22,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">And...</font>

829
01:13:22,972 --> 01:13:26,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I've said I'll go with him.</font>

830
01:13:27,877 --> 01:13:30,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Yeah. Great.</font>

831
01:13:31,747 --> 01:13:34,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine. No problem.</font>

832
01:13:34,784 --> 01:13:36,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Good.</font>

833
01:13:37,654 --> 01:13:39,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry?</font>

834
01:13:40,023 --> 01:13:41,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">I really am...</font>

835
01:13:41,992 --> 01:13:43,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">sorry.</font>

836
01:13:53,403 --> 01:13:55,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all right, Ron.</font>

837
01:13:55,072 --> 01:13:58,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's okay, Ron. It's all right.
It doesn't matter.</font>

838
01:13:58,442 --> 01:14:00,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened to you?</font>

839
01:14:00,577 --> 01:14:02,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">He just asked Fleur Delacour out.</font>

840
01:14:02,912 --> 01:14:05,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- What did she say?</font>

841
01:14:05,582 --> 01:14:07,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, of course.</font>

842
01:14:08,518 --> 01:14:12,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">- She said yes?
- Don't be silly.</font>

843
01:14:12,255 --> 01:14:16,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">There she was, walking by.
You know how I like it when they walk.</font>

844
01:14:17,426 --> 01:14:21,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">I couldn't help it.
It just sort of slipped out.</font>

845
01:14:21,230 --> 01:14:24,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, he sort of screamed at her.
It was a bit frightening.</font>

846
01:14:25,868 --> 01:14:29,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And what did you do then?
- What else? I ran for it.</font>

847
01:14:29,639 --> 01:14:33,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not cut out for this, Harry.
I don't know what got into me.</font>

848
01:14:33,542 --> 01:14:34,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hi, Harry.
- Hi, Harry.</font>

849
01:14:34,944 --> 01:14:38,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">I always liked looking at them
from behind.</font>

850
01:14:39,349 --> 01:14:42,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's never gonna forgive me, ever.</font>

851
01:14:42,551 --> 01:14:43,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey!</font>

852
01:15:00,636 --> 01:15:02,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bloody hell.</font>

853
01:15:04,573 --> 01:15:06,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bloody hell.</font>

854
01:15:09,845 --> 01:15:11,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bloody...</font>

855
01:15:11,314 --> 01:15:12,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, bloody...</font>

856
01:15:16,252 --> 01:15:19,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are those? What are those?</font>

857
01:15:19,122 --> 01:15:22,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">- My dress robes.
- Well, they're all right!</font>

858
01:15:22,324 --> 01:15:25,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">No lace. No dodgy little collar.</font>

859
01:15:25,429 --> 01:15:27,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I expect yours are more traditional.</font>

860
01:15:27,530 --> 01:15:32,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Traditional? They're ancient!
I look like my Great Aunt Tessie!</font>

861
01:15:34,938 --> 01:15:38,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">I smell like my Great Aunt Tessie.</font>

862
01:15:42,746 --> 01:15:44,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">Murder me, Harry.</font>

863
01:15:45,981 --> 01:15:47,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leave it alone!</font>

864
01:15:48,518 --> 01:15:52,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">Poor kid. I bet she's alone in her room,
crying her eyes out.</font>

865
01:15:52,122 --> 01:15:54,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who?
- Hermione, of course.</font>

866
01:15:54,757 --> 01:15:58,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, Harry, why do you think she
wouldn't tell us who she's coming with?</font>

867
01:15:58,528 --> 01:16:00,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because we'd take the mickey out of her
if she did.</font>

868
01:16:00,896 --> 01:16:06,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody asked her. Would've taken her
myself if she wasn't so bloody proud.</font>

869
01:16:06,970 --> 01:16:08,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hello, boys.
- Hello, boys.</font>

870
01:16:08,537 --> 01:16:10,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you look...</font>

871
01:16:10,940 --> 01:16:12,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">dashing.</font>

872
01:16:12,708 --> 01:16:16,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">There you are, Potter.
Are you and Miss Patil ready?</font>

873
01:16:16,046 --> 01:16:18,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ready, professor?
- To dance.</font>

874
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:21,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's traditional that the three champions...
Well, in this case, four.</font>

875
01:16:21,251 --> 01:16:22,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are the first to dance.</font>

876
01:16:22,652 --> 01:16:25,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Surely I told you that.
- No.</font>

877
01:16:25,855 --> 01:16:27,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, now you know.</font>

878
01:16:29,091 --> 01:16:33,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">As for you, Mr. Weasley, you may proceed
into the Great Hall with Miss Patil.</font>

879
01:16:33,563 --> 01:16:36,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, there you are.
- Come on, then.</font>

880
01:16:36,131 --> 01:16:37,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come along this way.</font>

881
01:16:42,506 --> 01:16:44,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, come on.</font>

882
01:16:45,175 --> 01:16:47,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hi.
- Now, I need you all to line up...</font>

883
01:16:47,344 --> 01:16:50,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the procession, please.
Oh, you are very late.</font>

884
01:16:52,916 --> 01:16:55,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">This way. This way. Come along.</font>

885
01:16:57,020 --> 01:16:59,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">She looks beautiful!</font>

886
01:16:59,421 --> 01:17:01,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, she does.</font>

887
01:17:48,404 --> 01:17:52,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that Hermione Granger?
With Viktor Krum?</font>

888
01:17:52,609 --> 01:17:55,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Absolutely not.</font>

889
01:17:59,882 --> 01:18:01,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi!</font>

890
01:18:10,193 --> 01:18:12,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry, take my waist.</font>

891
01:18:13,063 --> 01:18:14,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- Now!</font>

892
01:19:21,064 --> 01:19:23,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you ready?</font>

893
01:19:23,500 --> 01:19:26,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">Move your body like a hairy troll</font>

894
01:19:26,536 --> 01:19:29,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">Learning to rock and roll</font>

895
01:19:29,405 --> 01:19:32,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Spin around like a crazy elf</font>

896
01:19:32,509 --> 01:19:34,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dancing by himself</font>

897
01:19:35,045 --> 01:19:38,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boogie down like a unicorn</font>

898
01:19:38,547 --> 01:19:41,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">No stopping till the break of dawn</font>

899
01:19:41,150 --> 01:19:44,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put your hands up in the air</font>

900
01:19:44,186 --> 01:19:47,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like an ogre who just don't care</font>

901
01:19:47,657 --> 01:19:50,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you dance like a Hippogriff?</font>

902
01:19:52,662 --> 01:19:55,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ruddy pumpkinhead, isn't he?</font>

903
01:19:57,033 --> 01:20:00,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think it was the books
that had him going to the library.</font>

904
01:20:02,372 --> 01:20:04,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">May I have your arm?</font>

905
01:20:04,073 --> 01:20:07,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">Arm. Leg. I'm yours.</font>

906
01:20:32,702 --> 01:20:34,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hot, isn't it?</font>

907
01:20:34,970 --> 01:20:38,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">Viktor's gone to go and get drinks.
Would you care to join us?</font>

908
01:20:38,475 --> 01:20:42,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, we'd not care to join you and Viktor.</font>

909
01:20:43,846 --> 01:20:46,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's got your wand in a knot?</font>

910
01:20:46,483 --> 01:20:50,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a Durmstrang.
You're fraternizing with the enemy.</font>

911
01:20:50,353 --> 01:20:54,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">The enemy?
Who was it wanting his autograph?</font>

912
01:20:54,623 --> 01:20:57,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">Besides, the whole point
of the tournament...</font>

913
01:20:57,226 --> 01:21:01,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">is international
magical cooperation...</font>

914
01:21:01,331 --> 01:21:03,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">to make friends.</font>

915
01:21:03,565 --> 01:21:06,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think he's got a bit more
than friendship on his mind.</font>

916
01:21:16,712 --> 01:21:19,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you going to ask me
to dance or not?</font>

917
01:21:19,215 --> 01:21:20,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

918
01:21:28,891 --> 01:21:31,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He's using you.
- How dare you?</font>

919
01:21:31,493 --> 01:21:35,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Besides, I can take care of myself.
- I doubt it. He's way too old.</font>

920
01:21:35,864 --> 01:21:39,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What? What? That's what you think?
- Yeah, that's what I think.</font>

921
01:21:39,702 --> 01:21:42,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know the solution then, don't you?</font>

922
01:21:42,005 --> 01:21:44,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Go on.
- Next time there's a ball...</font>

923
01:21:44,173 --> 01:21:47,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">pluck up the courage and ask me
before somebody else does!</font>

924
01:21:47,476 --> 01:21:49,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">And not as a last resort.</font>

925
01:21:49,679 --> 01:21:54,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's... I mean,
that's just completely off the point.</font>

926
01:21:54,050 --> 01:21:55,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry.</font>

927
01:21:55,851 --> 01:21:57,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where have you been?</font>

928
01:21:57,319 --> 01:22:00,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never mind! Off to bed, both of you.</font>

929
01:22:02,625 --> 01:22:06,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">- They get scary when they get older.
- Ron, you spoiled everything!</font>

930
01:22:06,829 --> 01:22:08,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's this about?</font>

931
01:22:12,969 --> 01:22:16,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, don't let</font>

932
01:22:17,774 --> 01:22:22,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">This magic die</font>

933
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:26,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">The answer's there</font>

934
01:23:24,974 --> 01:23:27,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me see it again.</font>

935
01:23:28,377 --> 01:23:31,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, the time is close now.</font>

936
01:23:35,984 --> 01:23:38,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry, at last!</font>

937
01:23:39,154 --> 01:23:44,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Step aside, Wormtail,
so I can give our guest a proper greeting.</font>

938
01:23:55,104 --> 01:23:56,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">You all right, Harry?</font>

939
01:23:57,940 --> 01:23:59,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just got in.</font>

940
01:24:00,310 --> 01:24:01,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me.</font>

941
01:24:12,822 --> 01:24:16,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry, you told me
you'd figured the egg out weeks ago.</font>

942
01:24:16,259 --> 01:24:20,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The task is two days from now.
- Really? I had no idea.</font>

943
01:24:21,997 --> 01:24:23,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">I suppose Viktor's
already figured it out.</font>

944
01:24:23,966 --> 01:24:27,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wouldn't know. We don't actually
talk about the tournament.</font>

945
01:24:28,003 --> 01:24:32,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, we don't really talk at all.
Viktor's more of a physical being.</font>

946
01:24:36,345 --> 01:24:39,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just mean he's not
particularly loquacious.</font>

947
01:24:40,015 --> 01:24:42,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mostly, he watches me study.</font>

948
01:24:43,051 --> 01:24:45,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a bit annoying, actually.</font>

949
01:24:46,521 --> 01:24:49,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are trying to figure this egg out,
aren't you?</font>

950
01:24:50,059 --> 01:24:51,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's that supposed to mean?</font>

951
01:24:52,161 --> 01:24:55,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">It just means these tasks
are designed to test you...</font>

952
01:24:55,331 --> 01:24:58,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the most brutal way.
They're almost cruel.</font>

953
01:24:59,635 --> 01:25:01,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">And...</font>

954
01:25:03,605 --> 01:25:05,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm scared for you.</font>

955
01:25:06,442 --> 01:25:09,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got by the dragons mostly on nerve.</font>

956
01:25:09,645 --> 01:25:12,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not sure it's going
to be enough this time.</font>

957
01:25:12,314 --> 01:25:14,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Potter!</font>

958
01:25:19,756 --> 01:25:21,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Potter!
- Cedric.</font>

959
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:25,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">How...? How are you?</font>

960
01:25:26,695 --> 01:25:28,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">Spectacular.</font>

961
01:25:29,631 --> 01:25:33,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">I realize I never really thanked you properly
for tipping me off about those dragons.</font>

962
01:25:33,636 --> 01:25:36,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forget it. I'm sure you
would've done the same for me.</font>

963
01:25:36,271 --> 01:25:38,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Exactly.</font>

964
01:25:38,940 --> 01:25:41,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know the Prefects' bathroom
on the fifth floor?</font>

965
01:25:45,347 --> 01:25:48,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not a bad place for a bath.</font>

966
01:25:50,319 --> 01:25:52,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just take your egg...</font>

967
01:25:52,954 --> 01:25:55,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">and mull things over
in the hot water.</font>

968
01:26:30,893 --> 01:26:33,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">I must be out of my mind.</font>

969
01:26:43,271 --> 01:26:45,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm definitely out of my mind.</font>

970
01:26:48,110 --> 01:26:51,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd try putting it in the water
if I were you.</font>

971
01:26:51,546 --> 01:26:53,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">Myrtle!</font>

972
01:26:53,615 --> 01:26:55,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Harry.</font>

973
01:26:56,085 --> 01:26:59,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Long time no see.</font>

974
01:27:03,626 --> 01:27:07,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was circling a blocked drain
the other day...</font>

975
01:27:07,462 --> 01:27:11,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">and could swear I saw a bit
of Polyjuice Potion.</font>

976
01:27:11,067 --> 01:27:13,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not being a bad boy again,
are you, Harry?</font>

977
01:27:13,569 --> 01:27:15,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">Polyjuice Potion?</font>

978
01:27:16,104 --> 01:27:20,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kicked the habit. Myrtle, did you say,
"Try putting it in the water"?</font>

979
01:27:26,948 --> 01:27:28,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what he did.</font>

980
01:27:29,484 --> 01:27:31,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">The other boy...</font>

981
01:27:32,555 --> 01:27:34,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">the handsome one...</font>

982
01:27:35,925 --> 01:27:37,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cedric.</font>

983
01:27:40,563 --> 01:27:43,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, go on. Open it.</font>

984
01:27:51,340 --> 01:27:56,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come seek us
Where our voices sound</font>

985
01:27:56,511 --> 01:28:01,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">We cannot sing
Above the ground</font>

986
01:28:01,350 --> 01:28:05,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">An hour long you'll have to look</font>

987
01:28:06,454 --> 01:28:11,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">To recover what we took</font>

988
01:28:19,301 --> 01:28:20,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Myrtle...</font>

989
01:28:22,204 --> 01:28:25,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">there aren't merpeople
in the Black Lake, are there?</font>

990
01:28:26,542 --> 01:28:28,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very good.</font>

991
01:28:29,078 --> 01:28:33,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">It took Cedric ages to riddle it out.</font>

992
01:28:33,949 --> 01:28:37,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">Almost all the bubbles were gone.</font>

993
01:28:55,371 --> 01:28:57,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry, tell me again.</font>

994
01:28:59,041 --> 01:29:02,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Come seek us
where our voices sound. "</font>

995
01:29:02,043 --> 01:29:04,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Black Lake, that's obvious.</font>

996
01:29:05,581 --> 01:29:08,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">"An hour long you'll have to look. "</font>

997
01:29:08,283 --> 01:29:11,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Again, obvious. Though, admittedly,
potentially problematic.</font>

998
01:29:13,122 --> 01:29:15,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Potentially problematic"?</font>

999
01:29:15,157 --> 01:29:18,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">When's the last time you held your breath
underwater for an hour, Hermione?</font>

1000
01:29:18,961 --> 01:29:23,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, Harry, we can do this.
The three of us can figure it out.</font>

1001
01:29:23,466 --> 01:29:26,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hate to break up the skull session.</font>

1002
01:29:26,135 --> 01:29:28,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor McGonagall
wants you in her office.</font>

1003
01:29:28,371 --> 01:29:30,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not you, Potter,
just Weasley and Granger.</font>

1004
01:29:30,939 --> 01:29:33,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, sir, the second task
is only hours away, and...</font>

1005
01:29:33,775 --> 01:29:36,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">Exactly. Presumably Potter
is well prepared by now...</font>

1006
01:29:36,545 --> 01:29:38,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">and could do with
a good night's sleep.</font>

1007
01:29:38,581 --> 01:29:41,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go. Now!</font>

1008
01:29:51,060 --> 01:29:53,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">Longbottom!</font>

1009
01:29:53,029 --> 01:29:55,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you help Potter
put his books back.</font>

1010
01:30:03,706 --> 01:30:06,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know,
if you're interested in plants...</font>

1011
01:30:06,074 --> 01:30:08,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">you'd be better off with
Goshawk's Guide to Herbology.</font>

1012
01:30:09,278 --> 01:30:13,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know there's a wizard in Nepal
who's growing gravity-resistant trees?</font>

1013
01:30:13,783 --> 01:30:17,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">Neville, no offense,
but I really don't care...</font>

1014
01:30:18,119 --> 01:30:20,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">about plants.</font>

1015
01:30:20,189 --> 01:30:22,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, if there's...</font>

1016
01:30:22,057 --> 01:30:27,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">a Tibetan turnip that will allow me
to breathe underwater for an hour...</font>

1017
01:30:27,029 --> 01:30:29,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">then great. But otherwise...</font>

1018
01:30:29,698 --> 01:30:33,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know about a turnip.
But you could always use gillyweed.</font>

1019
01:30:34,670 --> 01:30:37,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Any bets? Any bets?
- Come on, place your bets!</font>

1020
01:30:37,739 --> 01:30:39,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">Step up, mates! Don't be shy.</font>

1021
01:30:39,375 --> 01:30:40,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Three lads.
- One lady.</font>

1022
01:30:40,975 --> 01:30:43,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Four go down.
- But do four come up?</font>

1023
01:30:43,311 --> 01:30:45,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't be so mean.</font>

1024
01:30:45,448 --> 01:30:47,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Any bets?
- Fleur's 10-1.</font>

1025
01:30:49,452 --> 01:30:51,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're sure about this, Neville?
- Absolutely.</font>

1026
01:30:51,619 --> 01:30:53,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">- For an hour?
- Most likely.</font>

1027
01:30:53,722 --> 01:30:55,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">Most likely?</font>

1028
01:30:55,390 --> 01:30:57,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, there is some debate
among herbologists...</font>

1029
01:30:57,760 --> 01:31:00,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">as to the effects of fresh water
versus salt water...</font>

1030
01:31:00,395 --> 01:31:03,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're telling me this now?
You must be joking!</font>

1031
01:31:03,231 --> 01:31:05,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just wanted to help.</font>

1032
01:31:05,368 --> 01:31:08,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that makes you a right sight
better than Ron and Hermione.</font>

1033
01:31:08,636 --> 01:31:10,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are they anyway?</font>

1034
01:31:10,573 --> 01:31:13,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You seem a little tense, Harry.
- Do I?</font>

1035
01:31:20,615 --> 01:31:23,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome to the second task.</font>

1036
01:31:23,018 --> 01:31:26,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">Last night, something was stolen
from each of our champions.</font>

1037
01:31:26,889 --> 01:31:28,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">A treasure of sorts.</font>

1038
01:31:28,423 --> 01:31:31,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">These four treasures,
one for each champion...</font>

1039
01:31:31,226 --> 01:31:34,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">now lie on the bottom
of the Black Lake.</font>

1040
01:31:34,095 --> 01:31:35,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">In order to win...</font>

1041
01:31:35,831 --> 01:31:39,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">each champion need only find
their treasure and return to the surface.</font>

1042
01:31:39,835 --> 01:31:42,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Simple enough, except for this:
- Put that in your mouth.</font>

1043
01:31:42,637 --> 01:31:46,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">They will have but one hour to do so,
and one hour only.</font>

1044
01:31:46,442 --> 01:31:50,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">After that, they'll be on their own.
No magic will save them.</font>

1045
01:31:50,845 --> 01:31:53,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">You may begin
at the sound of the cannon.</font>

1046
01:32:19,641 --> 01:32:22,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's the matter with him?
- I don't know, I can't see him.</font>

1047
01:32:23,912 --> 01:32:27,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my God.
I've killed Harry Potter.</font>

1048
01:32:28,751 --> 01:32:30,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah!</font>

1049
01:32:31,820 --> 01:32:33,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

1050
01:33:53,034 --> 01:33:55,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Beauxbatons champion,
Miss Delacour...</font>

1051
01:33:55,337 --> 01:33:58,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">has unfortunately
been forced to retire...</font>

1052
01:33:58,506 --> 01:34:01,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">so she will take no further part
in this task.</font>

1053
01:35:19,387 --> 01:35:21,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">But she's my friend too!</font>

1054
01:35:22,824 --> 01:35:24,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only one!</font>

1055
01:36:15,911 --> 01:36:18,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's get down below.</font>

1056
01:36:27,756 --> 01:36:30,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">Krum! Krum! Krum!</font>

1057
01:37:28,149 --> 01:37:30,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes!</font>

1058
01:37:48,002 --> 01:37:50,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ascendio!</font>

1059
01:37:55,310 --> 01:37:57,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry!</font>

1060
01:37:59,314 --> 01:38:01,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's all right.</font>

1061
01:38:01,984 --> 01:38:03,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's all right. Barty!</font>

1062
01:38:03,585 --> 01:38:07,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Go get him another towel.
- I want all the judges over here now!</font>

1063
01:38:07,622 --> 01:38:11,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">You saved her, even though
she wasn't yours to save.</font>

1064
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:13,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">My little sister.</font>

1065
01:38:13,862 --> 01:38:15,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

1066
01:38:16,230 --> 01:38:19,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you! You helped.</font>

1067
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:22,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, yeah, a bit.</font>

1068
01:38:29,845 --> 01:38:31,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Harry!
- Hermione!</font>

1069
01:38:31,180 --> 01:38:34,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you all right? You must be freezing.</font>

1070
01:38:35,082 --> 01:38:37,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">Personally, I think you behaved admirably.</font>

1071
01:38:37,185 --> 01:38:39,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">I finished last, Hermione.</font>

1072
01:38:40,055 --> 01:38:44,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Next to last.
Fleur never got past the Grindylows.</font>

1073
01:38:44,359 --> 01:38:47,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">Krum! Krum! Krum!</font>

1074
01:38:47,762 --> 01:38:50,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Come on! Come on!
- Attention!</font>

1075
01:38:53,001 --> 01:38:55,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">Attention!</font>

1076
01:38:56,070 --> 01:39:00,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">The winner is Mr. Diggory...</font>

1077
01:39:00,375 --> 01:39:04,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">who showed innate command
of the Bubble-Head Charm.</font>

1078
01:39:04,046 --> 01:39:06,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">However, seeing as Mr. Potter
would have finished first...</font>

1079
01:39:06,881 --> 01:39:12,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">had it not been for his determination
to rescue not only Mr. Weasley...</font>

1080
01:39:12,020 --> 01:39:16,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">but the others as well,
we've agreed to award him...</font>

1081
01:39:16,457 --> 01:39:18,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">second place...</font>

1082
01:39:18,627 --> 01:39:20,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Second place!
- Well done!</font>

1083
01:39:20,295 --> 01:39:23,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">for outstanding moral fiber!</font>

1084
01:39:24,198 --> 01:39:25,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes!</font>

1085
01:39:29,238 --> 01:39:31,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Right on.
- All that moral fiber, eh?</font>

1086
01:39:31,206 --> 01:39:33,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's great.
- Moral fiber?</font>

1087
01:39:33,007 --> 01:39:35,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blimey. Even when you go wrong,
it turns out right.</font>

1088
01:39:35,543 --> 01:39:38,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, well done, Moral Fiber.
- Congratulations, Potter.</font>

1089
01:39:38,380 --> 01:39:40,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">- A fine achievement.
- Thank you.</font>

1090
01:39:40,215 --> 01:39:41,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well done, boy.</font>

1091
01:39:41,917 --> 01:39:45,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">- See you at Hagrid's, Harry.
- I'm sorry we haven't spoken.</font>

1092
01:39:45,319 --> 01:39:49,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">After all, your story is one
I've heard so many times.</font>

1093
01:39:50,324 --> 01:39:53,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quite remarkable, really.
Tragic, of course...</font>

1094
01:39:53,962 --> 01:39:56,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">to lose one's family.</font>

1095
01:39:57,966 --> 01:40:00,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never whole again, are we?</font>

1096
01:40:02,371 --> 01:40:04,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">Still, life goes on...</font>

1097
01:40:05,140 --> 01:40:07,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">and here we stand.</font>

1098
01:40:09,677 --> 01:40:12,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure your parents would be
very proud of you today, Potter.</font>

1099
01:40:12,581 --> 01:40:14,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bartemius!</font>

1100
01:40:14,216 --> 01:40:18,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not trying to lure Potter into one of
the Ministry's summer internships, are we?</font>

1101
01:40:18,520 --> 01:40:21,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">The last boy who went into
the Department of Mysteries never came out!</font>

1102
01:40:34,202 --> 01:40:36,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">And they say I'm mad.</font>

1103
01:40:45,380 --> 01:40:49,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, I remember...
I remember when I first met you all.</font>

1104
01:40:49,283 --> 01:40:52,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Biggest bunch of misfits
I ever set eyes on.</font>

1105
01:40:52,820 --> 01:40:55,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">Suppose you remind me of meself a little.</font>

1106
01:40:55,556 --> 01:40:59,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And here we all are, four years later.
- We're still a bunch of misfits.</font>

1107
01:40:59,761 --> 01:41:03,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, maybe,
but we've all got each other.</font>

1108
01:41:03,265 --> 01:41:04,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Harry, of course.</font>

1109
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:10,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Soon to be the youngest
Triwizard champion there's ever been!</font>

1110
01:41:10,572 --> 01:41:12,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hooray!</font>

1111
01:41:14,042 --> 01:41:16,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hogwarts, Hogwarts
Hoggy Warty Hogwarts</font>

1112
01:41:16,712 --> 01:41:19,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Teach us something, please</font>

1113
01:41:29,323 --> 01:41:31,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Crouch?</font>

1114
01:41:37,899 --> 01:41:41,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">A man has died here, Fudge. And he
won't be the last. You must take action.</font>

1115
01:41:41,670 --> 01:41:43,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will not.</font>

1116
01:41:43,404 --> 01:41:47,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">In times like these, the wizard world looks
to its leaders for strength, Dumbledore!</font>

1117
01:41:47,641 --> 01:41:49,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then for once show them some!</font>

1118
01:41:49,144 --> 01:41:53,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Triwizard Tournament will not be
canceled. I will not be seen as a coward!</font>

1119
01:41:53,414 --> 01:41:56,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">A true leader does what is right,
no matter what others think.</font>

1120
01:41:56,784 --> 01:41:59,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What did you say to me?
- Excuse me, gentlemen.</font>

1121
01:41:59,755 --> 01:42:03,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">It may interest you to know
this conversation is no longer private.</font>

1122
01:42:07,762 --> 01:42:09,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Harry!</font>

1123
01:42:09,497 --> 01:42:12,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry, how good to see you again.</font>

1124
01:42:12,634 --> 01:42:14,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can come back later, professor.</font>

1125
01:42:14,336 --> 01:42:17,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not necessary, Harry. The minister and I
are done. I'll be back in a moment.</font>

1126
01:42:17,838 --> 01:42:20,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Minister, after you.</font>

1127
01:42:20,942 --> 01:42:23,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">There you are. Your hat.</font>

1128
01:42:23,110 --> 01:42:26,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Harry, do feel free to indulge in
a little Licorice Snap in my absence.</font>

1129
01:42:26,948 --> 01:42:30,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I have to warn you,
they're a wee bit sharp.</font>

1130
01:44:01,609 --> 01:44:03,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor?</font>

1131
01:44:03,377 --> 01:44:06,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Professor.
- Yeah.</font>

1132
01:44:16,824 --> 01:44:20,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">Igor Karkaroff, you have been brought
from Azkaban at your own request...</font>

1133
01:44:20,761 --> 01:44:22,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">to present evidence to this council.</font>

1134
01:44:22,863 --> 01:44:25,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should your testimony
prove consequential...</font>

1135
01:44:25,734 --> 01:44:29,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">council may be prepared
to order your immediate release.</font>

1136
01:44:29,970 --> 01:44:34,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">Until such time, you remain in the eyes
of the Ministry a convicted Death Eater.</font>

1137
01:44:34,743 --> 01:44:36,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you accept these terms?</font>

1138
01:44:37,011 --> 01:44:39,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I do, sir.
- And what do you wish to present?</font>

1139
01:44:40,047 --> 01:44:42,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have names, sir.</font>

1140
01:44:43,051 --> 01:44:46,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">There was Rosier, Evan Rosier.</font>

1141
01:44:49,323 --> 01:44:52,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Rosier is dead.
- He took a piece of me with him...</font>

1142
01:44:52,027 --> 01:44:54,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">though, didn't he?
- I didn't know.</font>

1143
01:44:54,328 --> 01:44:57,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">- If that is all the witness has to offer...
- No, no, no.</font>

1144
01:44:57,131 --> 01:45:00,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">There was Rookwood! He was a spy.</font>

1145
01:45:00,601 --> 01:45:03,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">Augustus Rookwood?
Of the Department of Mysteries?</font>

1146
01:45:03,137 --> 01:45:04,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, the same.</font>

1147
01:45:04,506 --> 01:45:08,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">He passed information to You-Know-Who
from inside the Ministry itself.</font>

1148
01:45:09,411 --> 01:45:12,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very well. Council will deliberate.</font>

1149
01:45:12,846 --> 01:45:14,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the meantime,
you will return to Azkaban.</font>

1150
01:45:14,983 --> 01:45:19,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! Wait! Wait, please! Please, I have more!
What about Snape? Severus Snape?</font>

1151
01:45:19,887 --> 01:45:23,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">As the council is aware,
I've given evidence on this matter.</font>

1152
01:45:23,024 --> 01:45:27,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">Severus Snape was indeed a Death Eater
and, prior to Lord Voldemort's downfall...</font>

1153
01:45:27,162 --> 01:45:30,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">turned spy for us at great personal risk.
- It's a lie!</font>

1154
01:45:30,332 --> 01:45:33,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Today he's no more a Death Eater than I am.
- Snape remains faithful to the Dark Lord!</font>

1155
01:45:33,935 --> 01:45:36,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">Silence!</font>

1156
01:45:36,837 --> 01:45:40,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unless the witness possesses
any genuine name of consequence...</font>

1157
01:45:40,442 --> 01:45:42,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">this session is now concluded.</font>

1158
01:45:42,743 --> 01:45:45,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no, no, no.</font>

1159
01:45:45,747 --> 01:45:47,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've heard about one more.</font>

1160
01:45:47,381 --> 01:45:50,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's that?
- The name.</font>

1161
01:45:50,118 --> 01:45:51,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes?
- I know for a fact...</font>

1162
01:45:51,752 --> 01:45:53,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">this person took part
in the capture...</font>

1163
01:45:53,954 --> 01:45:56,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">and, by means
of the Cruciatus Curse...</font>

1164
01:45:56,291 --> 01:45:59,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">torture of the Auror Frank Longbottom
and his wife!</font>

1165
01:45:59,961 --> 01:46:02,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">The name.
Give me the wretched name!</font>

1166
01:46:02,463 --> 01:46:05,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Barty Crouch...</font>

1167
01:46:07,702 --> 01:46:08,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Junior.</font>

1168
01:46:18,212 --> 01:46:20,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold him down!</font>

1169
01:46:23,551 --> 01:46:27,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get your filthy hands off me,
you pathetic little men!</font>

1170
01:46:28,890 --> 01:46:30,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Father.</font>

1171
01:46:31,893 --> 01:46:34,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are no son of mine.</font>

1172
01:46:45,273 --> 01:46:49,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">Curiosity is not a sin, Harry.
But you should exercise caution.</font>

1173
01:46:51,112 --> 01:46:52,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a Pensieve.</font>

1174
01:46:52,680 --> 01:46:57,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very useful if, like me,
you find your mind a wee bit stretched.</font>

1175
01:46:57,519 --> 01:47:01,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">It allows me to see once more
things I've already seen.</font>

1176
01:47:01,523 --> 01:47:04,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see, Harry, I have searched
and searched for something...</font>

1177
01:47:04,658 --> 01:47:06,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">some small detail...</font>

1178
01:47:07,628 --> 01:47:09,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">something I might have overlooked...</font>

1179
01:47:09,930 --> 01:47:14,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">something that would explain why
these terrible things have happened.</font>

1180
01:47:14,935 --> 01:47:19,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every time I get close to an answer,
it slips away.</font>

1181
01:47:19,873 --> 01:47:21,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's maddening.</font>

1182
01:47:23,811 --> 01:47:25,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir? Mr. Crouch's son.</font>

1183
01:47:26,347 --> 01:47:28,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">What exactly happened to him?</font>

1184
01:47:28,582 --> 01:47:33,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was sent to Azkaban.
Destroyed Barty to do it.</font>

1185
01:47:34,055 --> 01:47:37,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">But he had no choice.
The evidence was overwhelming.</font>

1186
01:47:39,127 --> 01:47:42,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why do you ask?
- It's just that I...</font>

1187
01:47:42,863 --> 01:47:45,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had a dream about him.</font>

1188
01:47:47,234 --> 01:47:50,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was in the summer, before school.</font>

1189
01:47:52,172 --> 01:47:55,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the dream, I was in a house.</font>

1190
01:47:55,377 --> 01:48:00,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Voldemort was there,
only he wasn't quite human.</font>

1191
01:48:00,314 --> 01:48:04,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Wormtail was there too.
And Mr. Crouch's son.</font>

1192
01:48:04,319 --> 01:48:07,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Have there been others like this dream?
- Yes.</font>

1193
01:48:07,988 --> 01:48:09,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Always the same one.</font>

1194
01:48:12,659 --> 01:48:15,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir, these dreams...</font>

1195
01:48:15,162 --> 01:48:20,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">what I see, you don't think
it's actually happening, do you?</font>

1196
01:48:22,002 --> 01:48:25,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think it's unwise for you
to linger over these dreams, Harry.</font>

1197
01:48:25,472 --> 01:48:27,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think it's best if you simply...</font>

1198
01:48:33,081 --> 01:48:35,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">cast them away.</font>

1199
01:48:44,125 --> 01:48:48,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a sign, Severus.
You know what it means as well as I.</font>

1200
01:48:56,805 --> 01:48:58,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">Potter!</font>

1201
01:48:58,172 --> 01:49:00,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's your hurry?</font>

1202
01:49:05,814 --> 01:49:09,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Congratulations, your performance
in the Black Lake was inspiring.</font>

1203
01:49:09,751 --> 01:49:12,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gillyweed, am I correct?</font>

1204
01:49:12,787 --> 01:49:14,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, sir.</font>

1205
01:49:15,256 --> 01:49:16,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ingenious.</font>

1206
01:49:18,493 --> 01:49:22,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">A rather rare herb, gillyweed.</font>

1207
01:49:23,264 --> 01:49:27,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not something found
in your everyday garden.</font>

1208
01:49:28,470 --> 01:49:30,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nor is this.</font>

1209
01:49:34,609 --> 01:49:36,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Know what it is?</font>

1210
01:49:37,578 --> 01:49:39,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bubble juice, sir?</font>

1211
01:49:39,581 --> 01:49:41,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Veritaserum.</font>

1212
01:49:42,216 --> 01:49:46,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three drops of this and You-Know-Who
himself would spill his darkest secrets.</font>

1213
01:49:46,087 --> 01:49:51,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">The use of it on a student is,
regrettably, forbidden. However...</font>

1214
01:49:51,926 --> 01:49:55,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">should you ever steal
from my personal stores again...</font>

1215
01:49:55,128 --> 01:50:00,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">my hand might just slip over
your morning pumpkin juice.</font>

1216
01:50:00,167 --> 01:50:04,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I haven't stolen anything.
- Don't lie to me.</font>

1217
01:50:05,707 --> 01:50:11,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gillyweed may be innocuous,
but boomslang skin, lacewing flies?</font>

1218
01:50:12,113 --> 01:50:15,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">You and your little friends are brewing
Polyjuice Potion, and believe me...</font>

1219
01:50:15,617 --> 01:50:18,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to find out why!</font>

1220
01:50:44,645 --> 01:50:46,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah!
- Yeah!</font>

1221
01:51:05,432 --> 01:51:07,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sonorus!</font>

1222
01:51:11,204 --> 01:51:16,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Earlier today, Professor Moody placed
the Triwizard Cup deep within the maze.</font>

1223
01:51:16,711 --> 01:51:21,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only he knows its exact position.
Now, as Mr. Diggory...</font>

1224
01:51:23,784 --> 01:51:25,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">and Mr. Potter...</font>

1225
01:51:27,454 --> 01:51:29,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">are tied for first position...</font>

1226
01:51:29,356 --> 01:51:33,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">they will be the first to enter the maze,
followed by Mr. Krum...</font>

1227
01:51:34,729 --> 01:51:38,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">and Miss Delacour.
- Come on! Krum! Krum! Krum!</font>

1228
01:51:39,067 --> 01:51:42,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">The first person to touch the cup
will be the winner!</font>

1229
01:51:46,506 --> 01:51:49,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've instructed the staff
to patrol the perimeter.</font>

1230
01:51:49,409 --> 01:51:52,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should, at any point, a contestant wish
to withdraw from the task...</font>

1231
01:51:52,512 --> 01:51:57,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">he or she need only send up
red sparks with their wands.</font>

1232
01:51:57,351 --> 01:52:01,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">Contestants! Gather around. Quickly!</font>

1233
01:52:04,391 --> 01:52:08,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the maze, you'll find no dragons
or creatures of the deep.</font>

1234
01:52:08,895 --> 01:52:12,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">Instead, you'll face something
even more challenging.</font>

1235
01:52:12,432 --> 01:52:15,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see, people change in the maze.</font>

1236
01:52:15,636 --> 01:52:17,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, find the cup if you can.</font>

1237
01:52:17,505 --> 01:52:22,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">But be very wary, you could just
lose yourselves along the way.</font>

1238
01:52:23,744 --> 01:52:26,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">Champions, prepare yourselves!</font>

1239
01:52:35,789 --> 01:52:37,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good luck.</font>

1240
01:52:37,658 --> 01:52:39,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">- My boy.
- See you later, Dad.</font>

1241
01:52:41,962 --> 01:52:44,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">On the count of three. One...</font>

1242
01:56:12,340 --> 01:56:13,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fleur?</font>

1243
01:56:15,243 --> 01:56:16,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fleur.</font>

1244
01:56:20,247 --> 01:56:22,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">Periculum!</font>

1245
01:57:00,755 --> 01:57:02,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get down!</font>

1246
01:57:02,789 --> 01:57:04,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get down!</font>

1247
01:57:05,158 --> 01:57:06,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">Expelliarmus!</font>

1248
01:57:16,002 --> 01:57:19,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, don't! Stop!
He's bewitched, Cedric!</font>

1249
01:57:19,372 --> 01:57:21,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Get off me!
- He's bewitched!</font>

1250
01:57:33,054 --> 01:57:34,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

1251
01:57:55,643 --> 01:57:57,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry!</font>

1252
01:57:59,713 --> 01:58:01,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry!</font>

1253
01:58:03,751 --> 01:58:05,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry!</font>

1254
01:58:07,654 --> 01:58:09,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry!</font>

1255
01:58:11,192 --> 01:58:13,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Reducto!</font>

1256
01:58:29,777 --> 01:58:32,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thanks.
- No problem.</font>

1257
01:58:32,680 --> 01:58:37,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, for a moment there,
I thought you were gonna let it get me.</font>

1258
01:58:37,551 --> 01:58:39,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">For a moment, so did I.</font>

1259
01:58:41,154 --> 01:58:42,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some game, huh?</font>

1260
01:58:43,356 --> 01:58:45,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some game.</font>

1261
01:58:50,197 --> 01:58:52,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go!</font>

1262
01:59:01,975 --> 01:59:05,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on, take it.
You saved me, take it!</font>

1263
01:59:05,179 --> 01:59:07,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Together. One, two...
- Two...</font>

1264
01:59:07,347 --> 01:59:09,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">three!
three!</font>

1265
01:59:21,028 --> 01:59:24,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You okay?
- Yeah. You?</font>

1266
01:59:31,037 --> 01:59:32,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are we?</font>

1267
01:59:38,078 --> 01:59:39,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been here before.</font>

1268
01:59:43,350 --> 01:59:45,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a Portkey.</font>

1269
01:59:46,720 --> 01:59:51,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Harry, the cup is a Portkey.
- I've been here before, in a dream.</font>

1270
01:59:53,060 --> 01:59:56,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cedric! We have to get back
to the cup. Now!</font>

1271
01:59:56,630 --> 01:59:58,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you talking about?</font>

1272
02:00:03,837 --> 02:00:06,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Harry! What is it?
- Get back to the cup!</font>

1273
02:00:14,381 --> 02:00:16,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who are you? What do you want?
- Kill the spare.</font>

1274
02:00:16,884 --> 02:00:19,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Avada Kedavra!
- No! Cedric!</font>

1275
02:00:30,965 --> 02:00:33,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do it! Now!</font>

1276
02:00:44,778 --> 02:00:47,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bone of the father...</font>

1277
02:00:47,448 --> 02:00:49,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">unwillingly given.</font>

1278
02:00:57,224 --> 02:01:00,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Flesh of the servant...</font>

1279
02:01:02,296 --> 02:01:05,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">willingly sacrificed.</font>

1280
02:01:09,569 --> 02:01:13,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">And blood of the enemy...</font>

1281
02:01:19,113 --> 02:01:21,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">forcibly taken.</font>

1282
02:01:27,654 --> 02:01:30,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Dark Lord shall rise...</font>

1283
02:01:31,391 --> 02:01:33,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">again.</font>

1284
02:02:36,724 --> 02:02:40,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">My wand, Wormtail.</font>

1285
02:02:49,670 --> 02:02:51,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold out your arm.</font>

1286
02:02:51,805 --> 02:02:53,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">Master.</font>

1287
02:02:53,573 --> 02:02:56,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, master.</font>

1288
02:02:56,377 --> 02:02:58,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">The other arm, Wormtail.</font>

1289
02:03:38,484 --> 02:03:40,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome, my friends.</font>

1290
02:03:41,788 --> 02:03:44,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thirteen years it's been, and yet...</font>

1291
02:03:45,192 --> 02:03:50,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">here you stand before me
as though it were only yesterday.</font>

1292
02:03:51,631 --> 02:03:54,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">I confess myself...</font>

1293
02:03:55,034 --> 02:03:56,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">disappointed.</font>

1294
02:03:57,270 --> 02:03:59,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not one of you tried to find me.</font>

1295
02:03:59,539 --> 02:04:03,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">Crabbe! Macnair!</font>

1296
02:04:03,810 --> 02:04:05,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goyle!</font>

1297
02:04:07,648 --> 02:04:09,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not even you...</font>

1298
02:04:13,153 --> 02:04:15,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lucius.</font>

1299
02:04:16,923 --> 02:04:21,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">My Lord, had I detected any sign,
a whisper of your whereabouts...</font>

1300
02:04:21,929 --> 02:04:25,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">There were signs, my slippery friend.
And more than whispers.</font>

1301
02:04:25,099 --> 02:04:30,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">I assure you, my Lord,
I have never renounced the old ways.</font>

1302
02:04:31,971 --> 02:04:37,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">The face I have been obliged to present
each day since your absence...</font>

1303
02:04:39,613 --> 02:04:42,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">that is my true mask.</font>

1304
02:04:42,615 --> 02:04:44,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">I returned.</font>

1305
02:04:46,653 --> 02:04:50,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">Out of fear, not loyalty.</font>

1306
02:04:51,692 --> 02:04:56,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Still, you have proved yourself useful
these past few months, Wormtail.</font>

1307
02:05:02,668 --> 02:05:05,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, master.</font>

1308
02:05:05,605 --> 02:05:07,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

1309
02:05:10,444 --> 02:05:13,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Such a handsome boy.
- Don't touch him!</font>

1310
02:05:14,280 --> 02:05:15,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry.</font>

1311
02:05:15,948 --> 02:05:18,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd almost forgotten you were here.</font>

1312
02:05:18,918 --> 02:05:23,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Standing on the bones
of my father. Yeah.</font>

1313
02:05:23,489 --> 02:05:25,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd introduce you...</font>

1314
02:05:25,024 --> 02:05:29,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">but word has it you're almost
as famous as me these days.</font>

1315
02:05:31,998 --> 02:05:34,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">The boy who lived.</font>

1316
02:05:34,835 --> 02:05:37,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">How lies have fed your legend, Harry.</font>

1317
02:05:37,904 --> 02:05:42,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shall I reveal what really happened
that night 13 years ago?</font>

1318
02:05:42,074 --> 02:05:46,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shall I divulge how
I truly lost my powers?</font>

1319
02:05:46,979 --> 02:05:48,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, shall I?</font>

1320
02:05:48,916 --> 02:05:50,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was love.</font>

1321
02:05:50,417 --> 02:05:55,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see, when dear, sweet Lily Potter
gave her life for her only son...</font>

1322
02:05:55,087 --> 02:05:57,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">she provided the ultimate protection.</font>

1323
02:05:58,091 --> 02:06:00,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could not touch him.</font>

1324
02:06:01,127 --> 02:06:03,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was old magic.</font>

1325
02:06:03,430 --> 02:06:05,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something I should have foreseen.</font>

1326
02:06:05,865 --> 02:06:07,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">But no matter, no matter.</font>

1327
02:06:07,835 --> 02:06:10,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Things have changed.</font>

1328
02:06:10,804 --> 02:06:14,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can touch you...</font>

1329
02:06:14,908 --> 02:06:16,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">now.</font>

1330
02:06:24,784 --> 02:06:26,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

1331
02:06:32,458 --> 02:06:36,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Astonishing what a few drops
of your blood will do, eh, Harry?</font>

1332
02:06:37,296 --> 02:06:39,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pick up your wand, Potter.</font>

1333
02:06:40,634 --> 02:06:43,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">I said, pick it up! Get up! Get up!</font>

1334
02:06:44,438 --> 02:06:46,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've been taught how to duel,
I presume, yes?</font>

1335
02:06:46,939 --> 02:06:49,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">First, we bow to each other.</font>

1336
02:06:49,542 --> 02:06:52,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, now, Harry.
The niceties must be observed.</font>

1337
02:06:52,078 --> 02:06:55,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dumbledore wouldn't want you
to forget your manners, would he?</font>

1338
02:06:55,481 --> 02:06:57,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">I said, bow.</font>

1339
02:06:58,685 --> 02:07:03,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's better. And now...
- No.</font>

1340
02:07:03,422 --> 02:07:05,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">Crucio!</font>

1341
02:07:07,761 --> 02:07:09,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Crucio!</font>

1342
02:07:10,564 --> 02:07:12,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">Attaboy, Harry.</font>

1343
02:07:12,666 --> 02:07:15,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your parents would be proud.</font>

1344
02:07:15,101 --> 02:07:18,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">Especially your filthy Muggle mother.</font>

1345
02:07:18,671 --> 02:07:20,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Expelliar...</font>

1346
02:07:23,277 --> 02:07:25,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to kill you, Harry Potter.</font>

1347
02:07:25,845 --> 02:07:28,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to destroy you.</font>

1348
02:07:30,050 --> 02:07:35,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">After tonight, no one will ever again
question my powers.</font>

1349
02:07:36,256 --> 02:07:38,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">After tonight, if they speak of you...</font>

1350
02:07:38,992 --> 02:07:41,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">they'll speak only of how you...</font>

1351
02:07:41,962 --> 02:07:43,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">begged for death.</font>

1352
02:07:43,963 --> 02:07:47,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I, being a merciful Lord...</font>

1353
02:07:48,268 --> 02:07:50,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">obliged.</font>

1354
02:07:50,203 --> 02:07:51,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get up!</font>

1355
02:07:56,710 --> 02:07:58,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you turn your back on me,
Harry Potter!</font>

1356
02:07:58,845 --> 02:08:01,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to look at me
when I kill you!</font>

1357
02:08:01,280 --> 02:08:04,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to see the light
leave your eyes!</font>

1358
02:08:18,431 --> 02:08:20,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have it your way.</font>

1359
02:08:21,201 --> 02:08:23,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Expelliarmus!
- Avada Kedavra!</font>

1360
02:08:41,121 --> 02:08:44,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do nothing! He's mine to finish!</font>

1361
02:08:48,362 --> 02:08:50,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's mine!</font>

1362
02:09:23,130 --> 02:09:27,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry, when the connection is broken,
you must get to the Portkey.</font>

1363
02:09:27,300 --> 02:09:29,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can linger for a moment
to give you some time...</font>

1364
02:09:29,536 --> 02:09:31,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">but only a moment.
Do you understand?</font>

1365
02:09:32,506 --> 02:09:35,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry, take my body back, will you?</font>

1366
02:09:35,708 --> 02:09:38,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take my body back to my father.</font>

1367
02:09:39,279 --> 02:09:40,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let go.</font>

1368
02:09:41,081 --> 02:09:43,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sweetheart, you're ready.</font>

1369
02:09:43,884 --> 02:09:46,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let go! Let go!</font>

1370
02:09:52,259 --> 02:09:53,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">Accio!</font>

1371
02:09:59,332 --> 02:10:01,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

1372
02:10:14,081 --> 02:10:15,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">He did it!</font>

1373

<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry!</font>

1374
02:10:21,354 --> 02:10:23,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry!</font>

1375
02:10:24,056 --> 02:10:27,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! No! No, don't!</font>

1376
02:10:27,594 --> 02:10:29,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">For God's sake, Dumbledore,
what's happened?</font>

1377
02:10:29,762 --> 02:10:32,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's back. He's back.</font>

1378
02:10:32,498 --> 02:10:34,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Voldemort's back.</font>

1379
02:10:34,701 --> 02:10:37,269

to bring his body back.</font>

1380
02:10:37,270 --> 02:10:39,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">I couldn't leave him, not there.</font>

1381
02:10:39,773 --> 02:10:42,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all right, Harry. It's all right.</font>

1382
02:10:42,743 --> 02:10:45,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's home. You both are.</font>

1383
02:10:45,212 --> 02:10:49,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep everybody in their seats.
A boy has just been killed.</font>

1384
02:10:51,917 --> 02:10:55,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">The body must be moved, Dumbledore.
There are too many people.</font>

1385
02:10:55,855 --> 02:10:57,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me through.</font>

1386
02:10:57,724 --> 02:10:59,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me through!</font>

1387
02:11:01,161 --> 02:11:02,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me through!</font>

1388
02:11:02,595 --> 02:11:04,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's my son!</font>

1389
02:11:05,297 --> 02:11:06,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's my boy!</font>

1390
02:11:09,569 --> 02:11:12,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's my boy!</font>

1391
02:11:15,108 --> 02:11:18,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Come on. Get up. Easy, easy!
- No.</font>

1392
02:11:18,845 --> 02:11:22,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is not where you want to be
right now. Come on.</font>

1393
02:11:22,481 --> 02:11:24,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

1394
02:11:27,753 --> 02:11:30,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all right, I got you.</font>

1395
02:11:30,323 --> 02:11:33,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got you. Come on. Easy, now.</font>

1396
02:11:37,663 --> 02:11:39,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you all right, Potter?</font>

1399
02:12:27,113 --> 02:12:29,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does it hurt? That?</font>

1400
02:12:29,216 --> 02:12:31,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not so much now.</font>

1401
02:12:31,952 --> 02:12:34,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps I'd better take a look at it.</font>

1402
02:12:37,189 --> 02:12:39,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">The cup was a Portkey.</font>

1403
02:12:41,895 --> 02:12:43,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone had bewitched it.</font>

1404
02:12:43,997 --> 02:12:46,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">What was it like?</font>

1405
02:12:46,432 --> 02:12:48,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What was he like?
- Who?</font>

1406
02:12:48,268 --> 02:12:50,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Dark Lord.</font>

1407
02:12:52,338 --> 02:12:55,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">What was it like
to stand in his presence?</font>

1408
02:12:56,710 --> 02:12:58,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

1409
02:13:01,347 --> 02:13:04,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was like I'd fallen
into one of my dreams...</font>

1410
02:13:07,253 --> 02:13:09,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">into one of my nightmares.</font>

1411
02:13:27,974 --> 02:13:29,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">Were there others?</font>

1412
02:13:29,708 --> 02:13:32,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the graveyard, were there others?</font>

1413
02:13:35,916 --> 02:13:37,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">I...</font>

1414
02:13:38,018 --> 02:13:42,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think I said anything
about a graveyard, professor.</font>

1415
02:13:49,395 --> 02:13:52,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Marvelous creatures, dragons,
aren't they?"</font>

1416
02:13:57,069 --> 02:14:00,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you think that miserable oaf
would've led you into the woods...</font>

1417
02:14:00,306 --> 02:14:02,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">if I hadn't suggested it?</font>

1418
02:14:05,744 --> 02:14:09,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think Cedric Diggory would've
told you to open the egg underwater...</font>

1419
02:14:09,615 --> 02:14:12,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">if I hadn't told him first myself?</font>

1420
02:14:13,720 --> 02:14:16,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you think Neville Longbottom,
the witless wonder...</font>

1421
02:14:16,555 --> 02:14:19,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">could've provided you with gillyweed
if I hadn't given him the book...</font>

1422

<font color="#FFFFFF">that led him straight to it?</font>

1423
02:14:29,903 --> 02:14:34,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was you from the beginning.
You put my name in the Goblet of Fire.</font>

1424

02:14:38,278 --> 02:14:40,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">You won because I made it so, Potter.</font>

1426
02:14:41,081 --> 02:14:44,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ended up in that graveyard tonight
because it was meant to be so.</font>

1427
02:14:44,751 --> 02:14:46,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now the deed is done.</font>

1428
02:14:47,720 --> 02:14:52,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">The blood that runs through these veins
runs within the Dark Lord.</font>

1429
02:15:00,567 --> 02:15:04,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Imagine how he will reward me
when he learns...</font>

- No.</font>

1438
02:15:38,438 --> 02:15:40,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry, away from there!</font>

1439
02:16:00,960 --> 02:16:04,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You all right, Alastor?

<font color="#FFFFFF">Polyjuice Potion.</font>

1442
02:16:10,403 --> 02:16:13,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now we know who's been stealing
from your stores, Severus.</font>

1443

<font color="#FFFFFF">Barty Crouch Junior.</font>

1446
02:16:57,750 --> 02:17:00,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll show you mine

1447
02:17:03,056 --> 02:17:04,500

1448
02:17:08,628 --> 02:17:11,108

1449
02:17:11,763 --> 02:17:13,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's back.</font>

1450
02:17:14,299 --> 02:17:16,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lord Voldemort has returned.</font>

1451
02:17:17,370 --> 02:17:19,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, sir. I couldn't help it.</font>

1452
02:17:19,906 --> 02:17:24,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">Send an owl to Azkaban. I think
they'll find they're missing a prisoner.</font>

1453
02:17:24,911 --> 02:17:27,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'll be welcomed back like a hero.
- Perhaps.</font>

1454
02:17:27,980 --> 02:17:31,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">Personally, I've never had much time
for heroes.</font>

1455
02:17:50,736 --> 02:17:53,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">Today, we acknowledge...</font>

1456
02:17:54,106 --> 02:17:57,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">a really terrible loss.</font>

1457
02:17:58,977 --> 02:18:01,914

<font color="#FFFFFF">infinitely fair-minded...</font>

1460
02:18:08,086 --> 02:18:10,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">and, most importantly...</font>

1461
02:18:10,690 --> 02:18:15,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">a fierce, fierce friend.</font>

1462
02:18:16,396 --> 02:18:21,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, I think, therefore, you have
the right to know exactly how he died.</font>

1464
02:18:26,172 --> 02:18:28,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cedric Diggory was murdered...</font>

1465

does not wish me to tell you this.</font>

1467

would be an insult to his memory.</font>

places and speak in different tongues...</font>

02:19:00,505 --> 02:19:05,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">the bonds of friendship we've made
this year will be more important than ever.</font>

will not have died in vain.</font>

02:19:18,390 --> 02:19:21,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">kind and honest...</font>

1479
02:19:21,361 --> 02:19:26,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">and brave and true,
right to the very end.</font>

1480
02:19:51,190 --> 02:19:53,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never liked these curtains.</font>

1481
02:19:53,825 --> 02:19:56,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">Set them on fire in my fourth year.</font>

1482
02:19:56,828 --> 02:19:58,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">By accident, of course.</font>

1483
02:20:04,336 --> 02:20:08,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">I put you in terrible danger
this year, Harry. I'm sorry.</font>

1484
02:20:12,111 --> 02:20:14,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor...</font>

1485
02:20:14,013 --> 02:20:17,254
<font color="#FFFFFF">when I was in the graveyard,
there was a moment...</font>

1486
02:20:17,816 --> 02:20:22,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">when Voldemort's wand and mine
sort of connected.</font>

1487
02:20:23,790 --> 02:20:26,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">Priori Incantatem.</font>

1488
02:20:30,263 --> 02:20:33,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">You saw your parents that night,
didn't you?</font>

1489
02:20:33,566 --> 02:20:35,647
<font color="#FFFFFF">They reappeared.</font>

1490
02:20:36,869 --> 02:20:40,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">No spell can reawaken the dead, Harry.
I trust you know that.</font>

1491
02:20:43,209 --> 02:20:46,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dark and difficult times lie ahead.</font>

1492
02:20:46,279 --> 02:20:51,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Soon we must all face the choice
between what is right and what is easy.</font>

1493
02:20:54,486 --> 02:20:56,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">But remember this:</font>

1494
02:20:56,322 --> 02:20:58,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have friends here.</font>

1495
02:21:00,259 --> 02:21:02,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not alone.</font>

1496
02:21:22,715 --> 02:21:24,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hermione.</font>

1497
02:21:24,851 --> 02:21:27,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is for you.</font>

1498
02:21:27,452 --> 02:21:29,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">Write to me. Promise.</font>

1499
02:21:30,756 --> 02:21:32,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bye.</font>

1500
02:21:38,397 --> 02:21:40,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">Au revoir, Ron.</font>

1501
02:22:24,277 --> 02:22:26,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think we'll ever just have
a quiet year at Hogwarts?</font>

1502
02:22:26,978 --> 02:22:28,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- No.</font>

1503
02:22:28,281 --> 02:22:32,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I didn't think so. Oh, well.
What's life without a few dragons?</font>

1504
02:22:37,056 --> 02:22:40,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything's going to change now,
isn't it?</font>

1505
02:22:47,200 --> 02:22:48,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

1506
02:22:53,406 --> 02:22:56,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Promise you'll write this summer.
Both of you.</font>

1507
02:22:56,876 --> 02:22:59,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">I won't. You know I won't.</font>

1508
02:23:00,712 --> 02:23:04,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Harry will, won't you?
- Yeah. Every week.</font>
