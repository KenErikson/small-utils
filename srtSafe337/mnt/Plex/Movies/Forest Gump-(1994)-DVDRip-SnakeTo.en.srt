00:03:09,925 --> 00:03:14,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello. My name's
Forrest... Forrest Gump.</font>

2
00:03:20,006 --> 00:03:21,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you want a chocolate?</font>

3
00:03:24,325 --> 00:03:28,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could eat about a million
and a half of these.</font>

4
00:03:28,646 --> 00:03:30,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">My mama always said</font>

5
00:03:30,566 --> 00:03:34,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">life was like
a box of chocolates.</font>

6
00:03:35,686 --> 00:03:38,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">You never know what
you're going to get.</font>

7
00:03:45,286 --> 00:03:48,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those must be
comfortable shoes.</font>

8
00:03:48,165 --> 00:03:51,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">I bet you could walk all day
in shoes like that</font>

9
00:03:51,461 --> 00:03:53,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">and not feel a thing.</font>

10
00:03:55,461 --> 00:03:58,758
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish I had shoes like that.</font>

11
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:01,156
<font color="#FFFFFF">My feet hurt.</font>

12
00:04:01,222 --> 00:04:03,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mama always said
there's an awful lot</font>

13
00:04:03,141 --> 00:04:06,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">you can tell about
a person by their shoes.</font>

14
00:04:06,981 --> 00:04:08,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where they're going,</font>

15
00:04:08,901 --> 00:04:10,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">where they've been.</font>

16
00:04:17,062 --> 00:04:19,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've worn lots of shoes.</font>

17
00:04:21,382 --> 00:04:24,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">I bet if I think
about it real hard</font>

18
00:04:24,262 --> 00:04:26,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could remember
my first pair of shoes.</font>

19
00:04:29,223 --> 00:04:32,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mama said they'd
take me anywhere.</font>

20
00:04:32,324 --> 00:04:35,226
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>She said they was my magic shoes.</i></font>

21
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, Forrest,
open your eyes now.</font>

22
00:04:44,901 --> 00:04:46,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's take a little walk around.</font>

23
00:04:53,956 --> 00:04:55,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do those feel?</font>

24
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:00,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">His legs are strong,
Mrs. Gump,</font>

25
00:05:01,028 --> 00:05:03,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">as strong as I've ever seen.</font>

26
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:07,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">But his back's as
crooked as a politician.</font>

27
00:05:07,396 --> 00:05:10,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we're going to straighten him
right up, aren't we, Forrest?</font>

28
00:05:10,694 --> 00:05:11,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forrest!</font>

29
00:05:11,973 --> 00:05:14,526
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Now, when I was a baby,</i></font>

30
00:05:14,596 --> 00:05:17,247
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Mama named me after
the great Civil War hero</i></font>

31
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,324
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>General Nathan Bedford Forrest.</i></font>

32
00:05:19,396 --> 00:05:22,692
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>She said we was related
to him in some way.</i></font>

33
00:05:22,757 --> 00:05:24,132
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>What he did was,</i></font>

34
00:05:24,197 --> 00:05:27,492
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>he started up this club
called the Ku Klux Klan.</i></font>

35
00:05:27,557 --> 00:05:30,853
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>They'd all dress up in their robes
and their bedsheets</i></font>

36
00:05:30,917 --> 00:05:35,172
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>and act like a bunch
of ghosts or spooks or something.</i></font>

37
00:05:35,237 --> 00:05:39,012
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>They'd even put bedsheets
on their horses and ride around.</i></font>

38
00:05:39,076 --> 00:05:42,971
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And, anyway, that's how
I got my name... Forrest Gump.</i></font>

39
00:05:43,045 --> 00:05:46,240
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Mama said the Forrest part
was to remind me</i></font>

40
00:05:46,308 --> 00:05:49,124
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>that sometimes we all
do things that, well,</i></font>

41
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:51,524
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>that just don't make no sense.</i></font>

42
00:06:00,165 --> 00:06:02,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">This way. Hold on. Ugh!</font>

43
00:06:03,045 --> 00:06:05,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

44
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:07,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are y'all staring at?</font>

45
00:06:07,108 --> 00:06:08,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">Haven't you ever seen</font>

46
00:06:08,548 --> 00:06:11,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">a little boy with braces
on his legs before?</font>

47
00:06:12,612 --> 00:06:13,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't ever let anybody</font>

48
00:06:14,052 --> 00:06:16,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">tell you they're better
than you, Forrest.</font>

49
00:06:16,452 --> 00:06:18,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">If God intended everybody
to be the same,</font>

50
00:06:18,853 --> 00:06:21,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">he'd have given us all
braces on our legs.</font>

51
00:06:21,733 --> 00:06:25,507
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Mama always had a way of explaining
things so I could understand them.</i></font>

52
00:06:25,701 --> 00:06:29,858
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>We lived about a quarter mile
off Route 17,</i></font>

53
00:06:29,925 --> 00:06:32,738
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>about a half mile from the town
of Greenbow, Alabama.</i></font>

54
00:06:32,805 --> 00:06:35,619
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>That's in the county
of Greenbow.</i></font>

55
00:06:35,685 --> 00:06:38,019
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Our house had been
in Mama's family</i></font>

56
00:06:38,084 --> 00:06:40,058
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>since her grandpa's
grandpa's grandpa</i></font>

57
00:06:40,132 --> 00:06:43,427
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>had come across the ocean
about a thousand years ago.</i></font>

58
00:06:43,492 --> 00:06:45,761
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Since it was just me and Mama</i></font>

59
00:06:45,827 --> 00:06:47,682
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>and we had all these empty rooms,</i></font>

60
00:06:47,747 --> 00:06:50,082
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Mama decided to let those rooms out,</i></font>

61
00:06:50,149 --> 00:06:51,523
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>mostly to people passing through,</i></font>

62
00:06:51,588 --> 00:06:55,036
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>like from, oh, Mobile,
Montgomery, places like that.</i></font>

63
00:06:55,108 --> 00:06:57,923
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>That's how me and Mama got money.</i></font>

64
00:06:57,988 --> 00:07:00,639
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Mama was a real smart lady.</i></font>

65
00:07:00,709 --> 00:07:02,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember what I told you, Forrest.</font>

66
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:05,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're no different
than anybody else is.</font>

67
00:07:07,747 --> 00:07:10,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you hear
what I said, Forrest?</font>

68
00:07:10,149 --> 00:07:12,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the same
as everybody else.</font>

69
00:07:12,548 --> 00:07:14,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are no different.</font>

70
00:07:14,468 --> 00:07:18,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your boy's... different,
Mrs. Gump.</font>

71
00:07:19,012 --> 00:07:21,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">His I.Q. Is 75.</font>

72
00:07:21,413 --> 00:07:23,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we're all different,</font>

73
00:07:23,908 --> 00:07:25,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Hancock.</font>

74
00:07:28,228 --> 00:07:30,562
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>She wanted me to have
the finest education</i></font>

75
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:33,923
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>so she took me to
the Greenbow County Central School.</i></font>

76
00:07:33,988 --> 00:07:36,802
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I met the principal and all.</i></font>

77
00:07:36,869 --> 00:07:40,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to show you something,
Mrs. Gump.</font>

78
00:07:40,069 --> 00:07:42,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, this is normal.</font>

79
00:07:42,437 --> 00:07:47,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forrest is right here.</font>

80
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">The state requires
a minimum I.Q. Of 80</font>

81
00:07:50,084 --> 00:07:51,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">to attend public school.</font>

82
00:07:51,812 --> 00:07:53,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mrs. Gump,</font>

83
00:07:53,124 --> 00:07:55,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">he's going to have to
go to a special school.</font>

84
00:07:55,973 --> 00:07:58,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, he'll be just fine.</font>

85
00:07:58,372 --> 00:08:00,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">What does normal mean anyway?</font>

86
00:08:00,773 --> 00:08:02,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">He might be...</font>

87
00:08:02,692 --> 00:08:04,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">a bit on the slow side,</font>

88
00:08:04,805 --> 00:08:06,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">but my boy Forrest</font>

89
00:08:06,245 --> 00:08:09,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">is going to get the same
opportunities as everyone else.</font>

90
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:11,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not going to
some special school</font>

91
00:08:11,204 --> 00:08:13,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">to learn how to retread tires.</font>

92
00:08:13,124 --> 00:08:15,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're talking about
five little points here.</font>

93
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:20,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">There must be something
can be done.</font>

94
00:08:20,612 --> 00:08:24,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're a progressive
school system.</font>

95
00:08:24,964 --> 00:08:27,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't want to see
anybody left behind.</font>

96
00:08:27,684 --> 00:08:32,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is there a Mr. Gump, Mrs. Gump?</font>

97
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:36,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's on vacation.</font>

98
00:08:36,995 --> 00:08:42,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eee! Eee! Eee!
Eee! Eee! Eee!</font>

99
00:08:42,243 --> 00:08:46,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eee! Eee! Eee! Eee!</font>

100
00:08:53,219 --> 00:08:56,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, your mama sure does care
about your schooling, son.</font>

101
00:08:57,058 --> 00:08:58,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mmm-mmm-mmm.</font>

102
00:09:02,337 --> 00:09:04,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't say much, do you?</font>

103
00:09:08,001 --> 00:09:12,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eee! Eee! Eee! Eee!</font>

104
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:15,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eee! Eee! Eee! Eee! Eee!</font>

105
00:09:15,841 --> 00:09:17,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Finally, he had to try.</font>

106
00:09:18,018 --> 00:09:20,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">"It looked easy, but...</font>

107
00:09:20,898 --> 00:09:23,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">oh, what happened.
First they..."</font>

108
00:09:23,456 --> 00:09:26,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mama, what's vacation mean?</font>

109
00:09:26,658 --> 00:09:27,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">Vacation?</font>

110
00:09:27,937 --> 00:09:29,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where Daddy went?</font>

111
00:09:31,457 --> 00:09:34,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">Vacation's when
you go somewhere...</font>

112
00:09:36,418 --> 00:09:38,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you don't ever come back.</font>

113
00:09:42,496 --> 00:09:44,351
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Anyway, I guess you could say</i></font>

114
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,871
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>me and Mama was on our own.</i></font>

115
00:09:46,945 --> 00:09:48,832
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>But we didn't mind.</i></font>

116
00:09:48,898 --> 00:09:51,231
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Our house was never empty.</i></font>

117
00:09:51,297 --> 00:09:54,111
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>There was always folks
coming and going.</i></font>

118
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:55,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">Supper!</font>

119
00:09:55,298 --> 00:09:56,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's supper, everyone!</font>

120
00:09:56,738 --> 00:09:58,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">That sure looks special.</font>

121
00:09:58,273 --> 00:10:00,990
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Sometimes, we had
so many people staying with us</i></font>

122
00:10:01,057 --> 00:10:04,352
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>that every room was filled,
with travelers, you know,</i></font>

123
00:10:04,418 --> 00:10:06,751
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>folks living
out of their suitcases</i></font>

124
00:10:06,817 --> 00:10:10,113
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>and hat cases
and sample cases.</i></font>

125
00:10:10,177 --> 00:10:13,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forrest Gump,
it's suppertime! Forrest?</font>

126
00:10:13,793 --> 00:10:16,510
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>One time, a young man
was staying with us,</i></font>

127
00:10:16,577 --> 00:10:19,544
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>and he had him a guitar case.</i></font>

128
00:10:23,937 --> 00:10:27,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, you ain't
never caught a rabbit ~</font>

129

this nice young man.</font>

133

<font color="#FFFFFF">No, that's all right, ma'am.</font>

134
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was showing him
a thing or two on the guitar.</font>

135
00:10:41,601 --> 00:10:44,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. Supper's ready
if y'all want to eat.</font>

136
00:10:44,481 --> 00:10:47,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, that sounds good.
Thank you, ma'am.</font>

137
00:10:47,361 --> 00:10:50,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say, man, show me that crazy
little walk you did there.</font>

138
00:10:50,721 --> 00:10:52,096

01:29:50,542 --> 01:29:51,916

1558
01:29:59,533 --> 01:30:01,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's where we'll find them.</font>

1559
01:30:13,485 --> 01:30:15,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">Still no shrimp, Lieutenant Dan.</font>

1560
01:30:15,405 --> 01:30:17,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">O.K., so I was wrong.</font>

1561
01:30:17,326 --> 01:30:20,140

going to find them?</font>

1562
01:30:20,206 --> 01:30:24,068

01:36:00,171 --> 01:36:03,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just my time.</font>

1648
01:36:03,180 --> 01:36:05,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, now...</font>

1649
01:36:06,157 --> 01:36:08,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">don't you be afraid,
sweetheart.</font>

1650
01:36:08,685 --> 01:36:11,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">Death is just a part of life.</font>

1651
01:36:12,012 --> 01:36:15,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something we're all
destined to do.</font>

1652
01:36:15,884 --> 01:36:18,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't know it,</font>

1653
01:36:18,189 --> 01:36:21,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I was destined
to be your mama.</font>

1654
01:36:21,069 --> 01:36:23,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did the best I could.</font>

1655
01:36:23,756 --> 01:36:25,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">You did good.</font>

1656
01:36:25,676 --> 01:36:31,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well... I happen to believe
you make your own destiny.</font>

1657
01:36:31,756 --> 01:36:36,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have to do the best
with what God gave you.</font>

1658
01:36:39,469 --> 01:36:41,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's my destiny, Mama?</font>

1659
01:36:42,029 --> 01:36:46,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're going to have
to figure that out for yourself.</font>

1660
01:36:47,564 --> 01:36:50,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">Life is a box
of chocolates, Forrest.</font>

1661
01:36:50,444 --> 01:36:53,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">You never know what
you're going to get.</font>

1662
01:36:53,323 --> 01:36:56,139
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Mama always had a way
of explaining things</i></font>

1663
01:36:56,203 --> 01:36:58,059
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>so I could understand them.</i></font>

1664
01:36:58,123 --> 01:36:59,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will miss you, Forrest.</font>

1665
01:37:01,197 --> 01:37:03,368
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>She had got the cancer</i></font>

1666
01:37:03,435 --> 01:37:05,291
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>and died on a Tuesday.</i></font>

1667
01:37:05,355 --> 01:37:07,844
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I bought her a new hat</i></font>

1668
01:37:07,917 --> 01:37:09,859
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>with little flowers on it.</i></font>

1669
01:37:12,684 --> 01:37:15,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's all I have
to say about that.</font>

1670
01:37:22,252 --> 01:37:24,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">Didn't you say you were waiting
for the number 7 bus?</font>

1671
01:37:24,908 --> 01:37:27,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">There'll be another one
along shortly.</font>

1672
01:37:30,893 --> 01:37:35,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, because I had been
a football star and war hero</font>

1673
01:37:35,212 --> 01:37:38,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">and national celebrity
and a shrimping boat captain</font>

1674
01:37:38,091 --> 01:37:39,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">and a college graduate,</font>

1675
01:37:39,533 --> 01:37:41,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">the city fathers
of Greenbow, Alabama,</font>

1676
01:37:41,931 --> 01:37:44,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">decided to get together
and offered me a fine job.</font>

1677
01:37:45,771 --> 01:37:49,154
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>So I never went back to work
for Lieutenant Dan,</i></font>

1678
01:37:49,229 --> 01:37:52,043
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>though he did take care
of my Bubba Gump money.</i></font>

1679
01:37:52,109 --> 01:37:54,923
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>He got me invested
in some kind of fruit company.</i></font>

1680
01:37:54,988 --> 01:37:57,323
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>So then I got a call from him</i></font>

1681
01:37:57,389 --> 01:37:59,844
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>saying we don't have to worry
about money no more,</i></font>

1682
01:37:59,917 --> 01:38:04,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I said,
"That's good. One less thing."</font>

1683
01:38:04,204 --> 01:38:05,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I've got a new hope... ~</font>

1684
01:38:05,997 --> 01:38:08,331
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Now Mama said
there's only so much fortune</i></font>

1685
01:38:08,396 --> 01:38:09,957
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>a man really needs,</i></font>

1686
01:38:10,028 --> 01:38:13,289
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>and the rest
is just for showing off.</i></font>

1687
01:38:13,356 --> 01:38:16,139
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>So I gave a whole bunch of it</i></font>

1688
01:38:16,204 --> 01:38:19,336
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>to the Foursquare Gospel Church...</i></font>

1689
01:38:19,404 --> 01:38:24,261
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>and I gave a whole bunch to the
Bayou La Batre Fishing Hospital...</i></font>

1690
01:38:25,676 --> 01:38:28,011
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>and even though Bubba was dead</i></font>

1691
01:38:28,077 --> 01:38:31,372
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>and Lieutenant Dan said I was nuts,</i></font>

1692
01:38:31,436 --> 01:38:34,055
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I gave Bubba's mama Bubba's share.</i></font>

1693
01:38:37,292 --> 01:38:38,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what?</font>

1694
01:38:38,957 --> 01:38:42,731
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>She didn't have to work
in nobody's kitchen no more.</i></font>

1695
01:38:42,796 --> 01:38:45,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">That smells wonderful.</font>

1696
01:38:45,356 --> 01:38:47,690
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And 'cause I was a gozillionaire</i></font>

1697
01:38:47,756 --> 01:38:50,572
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>and I liked doing it so much,</i></font>

1698
01:38:50,636 --> 01:38:53,931
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I cut that grass for free.</i></font>

1699
01:38:55,309 --> 01:38:58,604
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>But at nighttime
when there was nothing to do</i></font>

1700
01:38:58,668 --> 01:39:01,002
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>and the house was all empty,</i></font>

1701
01:39:01,069 --> 01:39:03,882
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I'd always think of Jenny.</i></font>

1702
01:40:04,845 --> 01:40:08,488
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And then... she was there.</i></font>

1703
01:40:39,916 --> 01:40:41,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Forrest.</font>

1704
01:40:41,228 --> 01:40:43,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Jenny.</font>

1705
01:40:53,740 --> 01:40:56,739
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Jenny came back
and stayed with me.</i></font>

1706
01:40:56,811 --> 01:41:01,448
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Maybe it was because
she had nowhere else to go,</i></font>

1707
01:41:01,515 --> 01:41:04,746
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>or maybe it was because
she was so tired</i></font>

1708
01:41:04,813 --> 01:41:08,108
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>'cause she went to bed
and slept and slept</i></font>

1709
01:41:08,171 --> 01:41:10,310
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>like she hadn't slept in years.</i></font>

1710
01:41:10,380 --> 01:41:12,649
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>It was wonderful
having her home.</i></font>

1711
01:41:12,716 --> 01:41:15,050
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Every day we'd take a walk,</i></font>

1712
01:41:15,117 --> 01:41:18,890
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>and I'd jabber on
like a monkey in a tree,</i></font>

1713
01:41:18,957 --> 01:41:21,770
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>and she'd listen about
Ping-Ponging and shrimping</i></font>

1714
01:41:21,837 --> 01:41:24,650
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>and Mama making
a trip up to heaven.</i></font>

1715
01:41:24,716 --> 01:41:26,570
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I did all the talking.</i></font>

1716
01:41:26,636 --> 01:41:29,025
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Jenny most of the time
was real quiet.</i></font>

1717
01:42:07,052 --> 01:42:09,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">How could you do this?</font>

1718
01:42:45,453 --> 01:42:49,761
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Sometimes I guess there
just aren't enough rocks.</i></font>

1719
01:42:51,212 --> 01:42:54,027
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I never really knew
why she came back,</i></font>

1720
01:42:54,092 --> 01:42:55,466
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>but I didn't care.</i></font>

1721
01:42:55,532 --> 01:42:57,386
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>It was like olden times.</i></font>

1722
01:42:57,452 --> 01:43:00,135
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>We was like
peas and carrots again.</i></font>

1723
01:43:01,707 --> 01:43:04,042
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Every day,
I'd pick pretty flowers</i></font>

1724
01:43:04,109 --> 01:43:07,524
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>and put them in her room for her,</i></font>

1725
01:43:07,596 --> 01:43:10,891
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>and she gave me the best gift
anyone could ever get</i></font>

1726
01:43:10,956 --> 01:43:12,331
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>in the wide world.</i></font>

1727
01:43:12,396 --> 01:43:14,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're made just for running.</font>

1728
01:43:14,891 --> 01:43:16,101
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- Carry me home to see my kin ~</i></font>

1729
01:43:18,667 --> 01:43:21,090
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And she even showed me
how to dance.</i></font>

1730
01:43:22,859 --> 01:43:25,128
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- I miss ol'Bammy once again ~</i></font>

1731
01:43:25,195 --> 01:43:26,373
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- And I think it's a sin ~</i></font>

1732
01:43:27,596 --> 01:43:29,189
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- Sweet home Alabama... ~</i></font>

1733
01:43:29,261 --> 01:43:34,082
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Well, we was like family,
Jenny and me...</i></font>

1734
01:43:36,876 --> 01:43:39,942
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>and it was the happiest time
in my life.</i></font>

1735
01:44:03,148 --> 01:44:04,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">You done watching it?</font>

1736
01:44:04,588 --> 01:44:05,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hmm.</font>

1737
01:44:05,548 --> 01:44:07,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to bed.</font>

1738
01:44:17,931 --> 01:44:19,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you marry me?</font>

1739
01:44:24,266 --> 01:44:27,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd make a good husband, Jenny.</font>

1740
01:44:29,547 --> 01:44:31,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">You would, Forrest.</font>

1741
01:44:33,707 --> 01:44:35,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you won't marry me.</font>

1742
01:44:37,707 --> 01:44:40,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't want to marry me.</font>

1743
01:44:42,988 --> 01:44:45,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you love me, Jenny?</font>

1744
01:44:50,507 --> 01:44:52,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not a smart man,</font>

1745
01:44:52,427 --> 01:44:56,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I know what love is.</font>

1746
01:45:32,108 --> 01:45:33,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jenny...</font>

1747
01:45:35,306 --> 01:45:37,511

1749
01:46:30,923 --> 01:46:32,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not running.</font>

1750
01:47:59,148 --> 01:48:01,034

1752
01:48:02,538 --> 01:48:05,408
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I decided to go for a little run.</i></font>

1753
01:48:05,484 --> 01:48:08,800
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>So I ran to the end of the road,</i></font>

1754
01:48:08,876 --> 01:48:12,072
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>and when I got there, I thought

run across Greenbow County.</i></font>

1758
01:48:20,555 --> 01:48:22,890

since I'd run this far,</i></font>

1759
01:48:22,954 --> 01:48:26,664
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>maybe I'd just run across
the great state of Alabama.</i></font>

1760
01:48:26,731 --> 01:48:28,587

<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a mama, Jenny.</font>

1940
01:56:53,898 --> 01:56:55,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a mama.</font>

1941
01:56:58,506 --> 01:56:59,880

<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at me, Forrest.</font>

1949
01:57:33,738 --> 01:57:35,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's nothing you need to do.</font>

1950
01:57:35,658 --> 01:57:37,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">You didn't do anything wrong.</font>

1951
01:57:38,537 --> 01:57:39,431

the smartest in his class.</font>

1958
01:58:13,033 --> 01:58:15,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, it's O.K.
Go talk to him.</font>

1959

<font color="#FFFFFF">What, do you have
a cough due to a cold?</font>

1964
01:58:59,529 --> 01:59:02,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have some kind of virus,
and the doctors,</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">they don't know what it is,</font>

1966
01:59:04,809 --> 01:59:07,775

they can do about it.</font>

1967
01:59:12,328 --> 01:59:14,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">You could come home with me.</font>

1968
01:59:16,009 --> 01:59:17,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jenny, you and...</font>

2012
02:02:58,025 --> 02:03:00,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was like just

2017
02:03:12,744 --> 02:03:15,560

<font color="#FFFFFF">I am.</font>

2053
02:05:34,185 --> 02:05:37,219

a... a letter.</font>

2054
02:05:38,505 --> 02:05:41,319
