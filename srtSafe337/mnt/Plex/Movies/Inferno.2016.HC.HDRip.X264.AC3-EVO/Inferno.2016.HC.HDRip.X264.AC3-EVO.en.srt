there's no evidence of intracranial bleeding.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Which is very reassuring.
Non-terminal.</font>

77
00:07:09,127 --> 00:07:11,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just try to relax.</font>

78
00:07:11,398 --> 00:07:13,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">Neurologically, you seem to be fine.</font>

79
00:07:13,802 --> 00:07:16,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your memory will return
over the next several days.</font>

80
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:19,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we'll...
we'll wait and watch.</font>

81
00:07:19,656 --> 00:07:22,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could you turn off the lights please.</font>

82
00:07:23,803 --> 00:07:25,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course.</font>

83
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">If the head trauma was bad enough
to cause a cerebral contusion, then...</font>

Can you please turn off the lights?</font>

85
00:07:34,257 --> 00:07:38,880

doing... in Florence?</font>

86
00:07:39,784 --> 00:07:44,401

That's the Palazzo Vecchio, isn't it?</font>

87
00:07:44,427 --> 00:07:45,528

88
00:07:45,555 --> 00:07:49,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">How...
How did I get here?</font>

89
00:07:49,115 --> 00:07:52,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">You came to our emergency room
3 hours ago with a head wound.</font>

90
00:07:59,322 --> 00:08:01,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was I...
Was I with a woman?</font>

91
00:08:01,607 --> 00:08:03,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, a cab driver brought you in.</font>

92
00:08:04,456 --> 00:08:08,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">No wallet. No phone.
No ID.</font>

93
00:08:08,403 --> 00:08:10,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you know my name?</font>

94
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:13,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've met.</font>

95
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:18,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw your lecture at Imperial College London,
we spoke afterwards,</font>

96
00:08:18,858 --> 00:08:21,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">you were very nice to me.</font>

97
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:22,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've met.</font>

98
00:08:23,487 --> 00:08:25,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, that's not quite fair.</font>

99
00:08:25,261 --> 00:08:26,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was nine at that time.</font>

100
00:08:27,016 --> 00:08:29,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait.
Nine-nine years old?</font>

101
00:08:29,567 --> 00:08:31,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was crazy about puzzles.</font>

102
00:08:32,947 --> 00:08:34,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I like your books.</font>

103
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:39,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe not "Lost language of Ideograms",
but the others.</font>

104
00:08:40,278 --> 00:08:41,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

105
00:08:41,405 --> 00:08:43,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">I read them all.</font>

106
00:08:43,878 --> 00:08:45,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">A weird kid.</font>

107
00:08:47,123 --> 00:08:49,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was actually.</font>

108
00:08:50,304 --> 00:08:51,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did I say that out loud?</font>

109
00:08:51,921 --> 00:08:53,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">You did.</font>

110
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very sorry.</font>

111
00:09:05,351 --> 00:09:09,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Langdon, your headaches
are going to be intense initially.</font>

112
00:09:09,475 --> 00:09:13,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you can also expect
nausea, confusion and dizziness.</font>

113
00:09:27,211 --> 00:09:29,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was the front desk.</font>

114
00:09:29,623 --> 00:09:31,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">The police are here to see you.</font>

115
00:09:32,248 --> 00:09:33,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me, why?</font>

116
00:09:33,623 --> 00:09:37,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Before you talk to them, Professor Langdon,
you should know the facts of your case.</font>

117
00:09:37,139 --> 00:09:38,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your head wound was not
caused by an accident.</font>

118
00:09:38,915 --> 00:09:40,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was the result of a gunshot.</font>

119
00:09:40,937 --> 00:09:43,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">A bullet grazed the top of your skull
and you most likely took a bad fall</font>

120
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">which is what caused the concussion.</font>

121
00:09:45,592 --> 00:09:48,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">If the bullet had been
an inch to the side,</font>

122
00:09:48,196 --> 00:09:50,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">it could have killed you.</font>

123
00:10:22,712 --> 00:10:24,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.
Come on.</font>

124
00:10:42,298 --> 00:10:44,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">This way.
This way, come on.</font>

125
00:11:17,769 --> 00:11:19,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">Taxi.</font>

126
00:11:24,288 --> 00:11:25,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get in.</font>

127
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, are you drunk?</font>

128
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened?</font>

129
00:11:35,706 --> 00:11:37,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go!</font>

130
00:11:41,975 --> 00:11:43,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">Step on it.
Floor it!</font>

131
00:11:43,038 --> 00:11:45,528

133
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:59,735

It's okay.</font>

139
00:13:01,825 --> 00:13:03,299

140
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:07,072

That policewoman just tried to kill us.</font>

141
00:13:07,097 --> 00:13:08,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

142
00:13:08,113 --> 00:13:10,407

instead if you like.</font>

Just give me... give me a minute.</font>

144
00:13:15,285 --> 00:13:16,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get a hold on things.</font>

145
00:13:16,418 --> 00:13:18,831

147
00:13:20,238 --> 00:13:22,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">Also, when you came into ER,</font>

148
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:24,827

why you would be saying this?</font>

153

00:13:45,667 --> 00:13:48,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can keep asking me
these questions, lady.</font>

155
00:13:48,034 --> 00:13:49,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I'm not going to
know the answers!</font>

156
00:13:49,568 --> 00:13:51,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">My name is Sienna.</font>

157
00:13:53,915 --> 00:13:55,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

158
00:13:58,063 --> 00:13:59,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello.</font>

159
00:14:00,553 --> 00:14:01,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi.</font>

160
00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:03,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">You asked a lot of questions.</font>

161
00:14:03,955 --> 00:14:06,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I'm feeling a tad
vulnerable right now.</font>

162
00:14:06,289 --> 00:14:09,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm with someone
other people want to shoot at!</font>

163
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:11,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

164
00:14:12,881 --> 00:14:15,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">Questions are important.</font>

165
00:14:15,072 --> 00:14:17,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">It will help you recover.</font>

166
00:14:17,754 --> 00:14:22,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I ask you for a...
cup of a...</font>

167
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's... It's... It's...
Um.</font>

168
00:14:27,365 --> 00:14:30,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is brown and
it's hot and...</font>

169
00:14:30,956 --> 00:14:34,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">People drink it in the morning
for energy. Uh...</font>

170
00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:36,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Tea.
- Tea. No. The other one.</font>

171
00:14:36,988 --> 00:14:38,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Coffee.
- Coffee!</font>

172
00:14:39,048 --> 00:14:41,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could I have a cup of coffee?</font>

173
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:43,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure.</font>

174
00:14:44,288 --> 00:14:45,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

175
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are very organized.</font>

176
00:14:54,192 --> 00:14:56,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like things tidy.</font>

177
00:14:57,298 --> 00:15:00,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you for helping me
at the hospital.</font>

178
00:15:00,701 --> 00:15:02,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was very courageous.</font>

179
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:04,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just reflexes.</font>

180
00:15:06,373 --> 00:15:08,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very sorry.</font>

181
00:15:12,139 --> 00:15:13,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very...</font>

182
00:15:18,111 --> 00:15:20,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">sorry.</font>

183
00:15:31,017 --> 00:15:33,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">I feel I'm having visions.</font>

184
00:15:33,389 --> 00:15:35,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the head trauma.</font>

185
00:15:35,922 --> 00:15:38,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">You won't be able to trust
your own thoughts for a while.</font>

186
00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:43,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw a plague mask.</font>

187
00:15:43,265 --> 00:15:47,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the kind the medieval doctors
wore in... during the Black death.</font>

188
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said something about that.</font>

189
00:15:49,933 --> 00:15:53,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were talking in the cab
it was mostly incoherent but...</font>

190
00:15:53,665 --> 00:15:56,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I did hear the word mask.</font>

191
00:15:56,693 --> 00:15:58,549
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anything else?</font>

192
00:15:58,575 --> 00:16:03,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">The bodies,
the blood and fire and...</font>

193
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:05,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">and hell.</font>

194
00:16:07,317 --> 00:16:09,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">And there's a woman.</font>

195
00:16:11,649 --> 00:16:13,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, there's a woman,
and she seemed...</font>

196
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seek and find.</font>

197
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:19,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh.
Well, seemed so dangerous.</font>

198
00:16:19,134 --> 00:16:21,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you got to have somebody
we should call.</font>

199
00:16:22,667 --> 00:16:25,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do?
Why?</font>

200
00:16:29,036 --> 00:16:31,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">My wat...
Was I wearing</font>

201
00:16:31,225 --> 00:16:33,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">my watch when I was
brought to the hospital?</font>

202
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:34,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

203
00:16:40,203 --> 00:16:42,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">You weren't wearing a watch.</font>

204
00:16:42,219 --> 00:16:45,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's important to me.
It was a gift from my parents.</font>

205
00:16:45,998 --> 00:16:48,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, you should
go ahead and clean up.</font>

206
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your clothes are covered in blood but
I think I got something that might fit you.</font>

207
00:16:53,157 --> 00:16:56,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once you get dressed,
we'll call the police, okay?</font>

208
00:16:56,513 --> 00:17:00,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No.
The Consulate.</font>

209
00:17:00,558 --> 00:17:03,924
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right.
The Consulate.</font>

210
00:17:10,469 --> 00:17:12,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">Coffee.</font>

211
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:55,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ignazio Busoni : I PRAY YOU ARE ALL RIGHT</font>

212
00:17:55,223 --> 00:17:57,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ignazio?</font>

213
00:18:03,769 --> 00:18:07,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">safely hidden, as am I.
Paradie Twenty-five.</font>

214
00:18:07,369 --> 00:18:10,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now they're after me too.</font>

215
00:18:11,174 --> 00:18:13,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">What we stole</font>

216
00:18:13,115 --> 00:18:17,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">is safely hidden, as am I.</font>

217
00:18:18,353 --> 00:18:20,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">"What we stole"?</font>

218
00:18:20,048 --> 00:18:23,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Paradise Twenty-five.</font>

219
00:18:29,622 --> 00:18:31,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ignazio.</font>

220
00:18:48,952 --> 00:18:51,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've left your things
in the bathroom.</font>

221
00:18:51,762 --> 00:18:53,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">Try these.</font>

222
00:18:53,742 --> 00:18:55,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whose are they?</font>

223
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:57,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">A friend's.</font>

224
00:18:57,217 --> 00:18:58,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does he live here?</font>

225
00:18:59,003 --> 00:19:00,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes.</font>

226
00:19:00,163 --> 00:19:02,616
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.
Sometimes, huh.</font>

227
00:19:02,772 --> 00:19:04,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're being rude.</font>

228
00:19:04,426 --> 00:19:05,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

229
00:19:05,749 --> 00:19:07,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, I'm not like this.</font>

230
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:09,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">You kind of are.</font>

231
00:19:59,229 --> 00:20:01,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">I found this in my old jacket.</font>

232
00:20:02,796 --> 00:20:04,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a biotube.</font>

233
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:07,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're used for transporting
dangerous substances.</font>

234
00:20:07,942 --> 00:20:09,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing with it?</font>

235
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:11,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have no idea.</font>

236
00:20:11,465 --> 00:20:13,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a high end unit.</font>

237
00:20:14,928 --> 00:20:16,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">Government issue.</font>

238
00:20:17,036 --> 00:20:21,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's called thumbprint recognition.
Security in case it's lost or stolen.</font>

239
00:20:21,412 --> 00:20:26,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tubes like this can only be opened
by a specified individual.</font>

240
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it sure hell isn't me.</font>

241
00:20:28,232 --> 00:20:30,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Then why do you have it?
- I don't know.</font>

242
00:20:30,567 --> 00:20:32,718
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm getting the number
for the Consulate.</font>

243
00:20:32,742 --> 00:20:34,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, please.
Wait.</font>

244
00:20:34,663 --> 00:20:37,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have waited.
This isn't right.</font>

245
00:20:37,923 --> 00:20:39,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you have it?
Where did you get it?</font>

246
00:20:39,403 --> 00:20:40,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, there is a simple way</font>

247
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">to find out if this thing
belongs to me.</font>

248
00:20:42,933 --> 00:20:44,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then my thumb will open it
or it won't.</font>

249
00:20:44,641 --> 00:20:46,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">Open it, are you insane?</font>

250
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:49,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">If it's a viral agent,
will it be released if I opened it?</font>

251
00:20:50,683 --> 00:20:52,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

252
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:56,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, there'll be an inner sleeve
maybe even two.</font>

253
00:20:57,513 --> 00:21:00,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Before I put myself in anyone's hands
I want to know what this thing is.</font>

254
00:21:00,526 --> 00:21:03,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, and what I'm involved with.</font>

255
00:21:04,349 --> 00:21:06,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">That make sense, doesn't it?</font>

256
00:21:06,884 --> 00:21:08,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

257
00:21:09,321 --> 00:21:11,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, we agree.</font>

258
00:21:12,287 --> 00:21:14,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're opening it.</font>

259
00:21:34,846 --> 00:21:37,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that explains
that it is mine.</font>

260
00:21:38,042 --> 00:21:42,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a cylinder seal
made of ivory.</font>

261
00:21:42,688 --> 00:21:44,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

262
00:21:45,892 --> 00:21:47,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's bone.</font>

263
00:21:48,076 --> 00:21:49,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">Human.</font>

264
00:21:51,876 --> 00:21:54,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three-headed, man eating Satan.</font>

265
00:21:54,836 --> 00:21:57,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">A common image from the Middle Ages</font>

266
00:21:57,613 --> 00:22:00,499
<font color="#FFFFFF">associated with the Black Plague.</font>

267
00:22:00,526 --> 00:22:02,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">The 3 gnashing mouths
are symbolic of</font>

268
00:22:02,804 --> 00:22:05,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">how effectively the plague ate
through the population.</font>

269
00:22:05,499 --> 00:22:08,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yet you can't remember
the word for coffee.</font>

270
00:22:09,465 --> 00:22:12,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">It explains my visions,
sort of.</font>

271
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do you hear that?
- Mm-mm.</font>

272
00:22:17,882 --> 00:22:20,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">This could be a Faraday pointer.</font>

273
00:22:27,286 --> 00:22:30,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">So why-why this, huh?</font>

274
00:22:43,978 --> 00:22:45,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Botticelli.</font>

275
00:22:45,923 --> 00:22:47,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's his map of hell.</font>

276
00:22:47,894 --> 00:22:51,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">He painted it as an
illustration of Dante's Inferno.</font>

277
00:22:52,198 --> 00:22:54,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">I studied Dante
when I was younger.</font>

278
00:22:54,994 --> 00:22:56,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">Probably in kindergarden.</font>

279
00:22:56,623 --> 00:22:58,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was a bit obsessed.</font>

280
00:22:58,162 --> 00:23:02,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dante defined our modern conception of hell.</font>

281
00:23:02,238 --> 00:23:06,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our vision of it hasn't changed
since he defined it 700 years ago.</font>

282
00:23:06,457 --> 00:23:12,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Botticelli drew it but...
Dante created hell as we know it.</font>

283
00:23:12,507 --> 00:23:15,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is what I have been seeing.</font>

284
00:23:15,265 --> 00:23:17,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">Torment.</font>

285
00:23:17,385 --> 00:23:19,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sinners.</font>

286
00:23:19,394 --> 00:23:21,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">Branding with letters..</font>

287
00:23:21,446 --> 00:23:24,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">Liars, covered with rashes.</font>

288
00:23:24,635 --> 00:23:27,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Soothsayers with their heads
ripped backwards.</font>

289
00:23:27,595 --> 00:23:30,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Serpents.
- The punishment for thievery.</font>

290
00:23:31,616 --> 00:23:34,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">Suffer, you sinners.
Pay for your sins.</font>

291
00:23:34,555 --> 00:23:37,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you have no idea
why you have this?</font>

292
00:23:39,009 --> 00:23:41,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think maybe
we call the consulate now.</font>

293
00:23:41,786 --> 00:23:43,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right.</font>

294
00:23:46,376 --> 00:23:47,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Langdon?</font>

295
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:50,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, yes.
Speaking.</font>

296
00:23:50,837 --> 00:23:54,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank heavens you're alive.
We've been looking for you.</font>

297
00:23:54,596 --> 00:23:56,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have?</font>

298
00:23:56,376 --> 00:23:58,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you still in possession?</font>

299
00:23:59,903 --> 00:24:03,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Langdon, do you have the tube?</font>

300
00:24:03,203 --> 00:24:06,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes.
- Where are you located?</font>

301
00:24:06,438 --> 00:24:09,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor, we can't help you
if we can't find you.</font>

302
00:24:10,606 --> 00:24:12,446
<font color="#FFFFFF">If that's the consulate,
how do they know?</font>

303
00:24:12,471 --> 00:24:14,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because they know.</font>

304
00:24:17,536 --> 00:24:19,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do we do?</font>

305
00:24:21,779 --> 00:24:23,692

<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hello.
- Professor, we were cut off.</font>

307
00:24:32,777 --> 00:24:34,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, sorry.</font>

308
00:24:34,576 --> 00:24:35,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are you located?</font>

309
00:24:35,779 --> 00:24:40,492

Pensione la Fiorentina.</font>

310
00:24:40,518 --> 00:24:43,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay in your room.
We're sending someone now.</font>

311
00:24:43,141 --> 00:24:46,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll wait here,
room 39.</font>

312
00:24:48,387 --> 00:24:51,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.
We wait and see who they send.</font>

313
00:24:58,262 --> 00:25:02,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">Langdon accessed his email account from
an unmasked IP address here in Florence</font>

317
00:25:09,057 --> 00:25:09,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">12 minutes.</font>

318
00:25:10,003 --> 00:25:12,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go! I want that pointer back
and I want Langdon.</font>

319
00:25:12,613 --> 00:25:14,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever it takes, let's get him.</font>

320
00:25:14,259 --> 00:25:16,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go, go, go, go, now!</font>

321
00:25:22,659 --> 00:25:25,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at this.
This is odd.</font>

322
00:25:25,769 --> 00:25:28,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">This area here, this is
Dante's 8th level of hell.</font>

means evil ditches.</font>

is not in the original painting.</font>

327
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:42,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's another one.</font>

328
00:25:43,044 --> 00:25:45,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where?
- An "E".</font>

329

<font color="#FFFFFF">- A "V", "R".
- Ah, there.</font>

333
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:57,401
<font color="#FFFFFF">- "T".
- There, there, "A".</font>

334
00:25:58,468 --> 00:25:59,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is that.</font>

335
00:25:59,397 --> 00:26:01,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's text.
Is that in English?</font>

336

<font color="#FFFFFF">Bertrand Zobrist.</font>

337

- Hm.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Here he is.</font>

341
00:26:32,868 --> 00:26:36,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">It took the earth's population
a hundred thousand years</font>

342
00:26:36,901 --> 00:26:38,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">to reach a billion people.</font>

343
00:26:39,377 --> 00:26:43,488

to reach two billion.</font>

344
00:26:43,653 --> 00:26:50,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">And only fifty years to double again
to four billion people in 1970.</font>

345
00:26:51,152 --> 00:26:55,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're nearly at eight billion now.</font>

346
00:26:55,272 --> 00:26:59,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bartlett used the example of a beaker.</font>

347
00:26:59,663 --> 00:27:01,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">With a single bacterium.</font>

348
00:27:01,213 --> 00:27:04,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">One that divides
and doubles every minute.</font>

349
00:27:04,569 --> 00:27:08,279

into the beaker at 11 o'clock.</font>

still only half full?</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">11:59.</font>

353
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:22,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what time it is for us.</font>

354
00:27:22,819 --> 00:27:29,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">In 40 years,
32 billion people... will fight to survive.</font>

355
00:27:31,034 --> 00:27:32,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">No fail.</font>

356
00:27:34,848 --> 00:27:37,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're a minute to midnight.</font>

357
00:27:37,267 --> 00:27:43,169
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every single global ill that plagues the Earth
can be traced back to human overpopulation.</font>

358
00:27:43,192 --> 00:27:47,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">But serious birth control measures
they don't stand a chance.</font>

359
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:50,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">Outrageous!
Violation of my rights!</font>

360
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:55,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">Invasion of my privacy!
Don't tell me what to do!</font>

361

00:28:11,266 --> 00:28:16,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">the sixth extinction
will be our own.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">We're a minute to midnight.</font>

366
00:28:22,996 --> 00:28:24,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like he's got
a lot of followers.</font>

367
00:28:24,856 --> 00:28:27,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, from all over the world.</font>

368
00:28:30,323 --> 00:28:32,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">He is compelling.</font>

369
00:28:32,904 --> 00:28:37,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">The 2 year disappearance during which
some authorities feared Zobrist</font>

370
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:41,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">may have designed
an opportunistic viral pathogen.</font>

371
00:28:41,449 --> 00:28:43,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">He created a plague.</font>

372
00:28:46,501 --> 00:28:48,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, why Dante?</font>

373
00:28:48,266 --> 00:28:49,816
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why this map of hell?</font>

374
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is this supposed to be a puzzle
or a challenge?</font>

375
00:28:52,832 --> 00:28:55,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or a suicide note.</font>

376
00:28:55,811 --> 00:28:58,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">He killed himself 3 days ago.</font>

377
00:29:06,669 --> 00:29:08,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">The levels.</font>

378
00:29:09,846 --> 00:29:13,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">The levels are out of order,
that's what's been bothering me.</font>

379
00:29:13,074 --> 00:29:16,276
<font color="#FFFFFF">The circles of hell
had been rearranged.</font>

380
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the same woman
from the hospital.</font>

381
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:22,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't stay here.
And we certainly can't trust the Consulate.</font>

382
00:29:22,298 --> 00:29:24,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Flatters are dipping in excrement,
that's not right.</font>

383
00:29:24,411 --> 00:29:26,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">If the plague exist, do you know
how many governments would want it?</font>

384
00:29:26,877 --> 00:29:28,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clerical profiteers, not there.</font>

385
00:29:28,576 --> 00:29:30,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What they would do to get it.
- Someone who discord dead, no.</font>

386
00:29:30,713 --> 00:29:32,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">A biological weapon.</font>

387
00:29:33,251 --> 00:29:34,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">The letters.</font>

388
00:29:36,804 --> 00:29:41,031
<font color="#FFFFFF">He has assigned a letter to each sin
and then changed their order.</font>

389
00:29:41,057 --> 00:29:42,919
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's made an anagram.</font>

390
00:29:44,259 --> 00:29:47,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.
Anagram!</font>

391
00:29:51,357 --> 00:29:54,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go.
I know another way out.</font>

392
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:03,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you have phoned,
best leave it here.</font>

393
00:30:03,566 --> 00:30:04,846

394
00:30:04,871 --> 00:30:08,555

I'm not even wearing my own clothes.</font>

395
00:30:08,579 --> 00:30:11,353

<font color="#FFFFFF">Cerca trova.</font>

402
00:30:45,686 --> 00:30:48,942

He's going to want to liquidate.</font>

438
00:33:56,384 --> 00:33:59,523

00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:07,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now the WHO has
overtaken our position.</font>

a mugging gone awry.</font>

445
00:34:21,481 --> 00:34:25,181

Cash gone, wallet remains.</font>

- Intact but anxious.</font>

452

453
00:35:01,541 --> 00:35:05,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">What in god's name
has this client gotten us into?</font>

454
00:35:05,074 --> 00:35:08,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no.
This is uh... rhetorical.</font>

455
00:35:11,014 --> 00:35:13,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">When are we due to receive
the client's video?</font>

456
00:35:14,222 --> 00:35:15,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">It just arrived.</font>

457
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:17,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">His instructions were to
upload it in 24 hours.</font>

458
00:35:17,947 --> 00:35:19,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to look at it now.</font>

459
00:35:19,411 --> 00:35:21,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">But, the client, Mr. Zobrist.</font>

460
00:35:21,041 --> 00:35:24,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">The client, client, is dead.
I want to see the video.</font>

461
00:35:24,389 --> 00:35:27,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a violation of our protocols.</font>

462
00:35:32,148 --> 00:35:35,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not the government.
We get things done.</font>

463
00:35:35,474 --> 00:35:37,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Arbogast.</font>

464
00:35:37,931 --> 00:35:42,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chief among the attributes that makes us
so very good at our job</font>

465
00:35:42,125 --> 00:35:45,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">is that as far as the world
is concerned, we don't exist.</font>

466
00:35:45,849 --> 00:35:49,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">If this video implicates or
even mentions us in anyway,</font>

467
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:53,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to stop it's release.
For the benefit of all our clients.</font>

468
00:35:53,342 --> 00:35:56,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">You asked me to avoid abnormalities
in procedure, that's all.</font>

469
00:35:56,161 --> 00:36:00,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about Mr. Zobrist
has ever remotely resembled normal.</font>

470
00:36:00,443 --> 00:36:03,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, I...
- Also rhetorical.</font>

471
00:36:03,288 --> 00:36:05,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bring me the video.</font>

472
00:36:07,594 --> 00:36:10,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the Vecchio's Hall of the
Five Hundred, there's a famous mural,</font>

473
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:13,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">Giorgio Vasari's Battle of Marciano.</font>

474
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:16,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">Near the top of the mural
is a coded message</font>

475
00:36:16,027 --> 00:36:17,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">which is one the art world's
most famous puzzles.</font>

476
00:36:17,844 --> 00:36:19,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what's the message?</font>

477
00:36:19,244 --> 00:36:20,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cerca trova.</font>

478
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:23,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seek and find.</font>

479
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:25,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">At the hospital,
I kept saying I was sorry.</font>

480
00:36:25,615 --> 00:36:27,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very sorry, over and over.</font>

481
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:28,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, maybe that's not
what I meant.</font>

482
00:36:28,608 --> 00:36:31,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">The name of the artist, Vasari.
I could have been saying Vasari.</font>

483
00:36:31,318 --> 00:36:34,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's good.
You seem clearer.</font>

484
00:36:34,454 --> 00:36:37,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I am.
- What's your middle name?</font>

485
00:36:38,226 --> 00:36:39,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I am.</font>

486
00:36:40,384 --> 00:36:41,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hm.</font>

487
00:36:42,068 --> 00:36:44,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">Zobrist is dead
but if his plague is real...</font>

488
00:36:45,018 --> 00:36:49,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then this map is a trail
he has left so someone can find it.</font>

489
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:51,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who?</font>

490
00:36:51,483 --> 00:36:54,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, someone who believes
the same as he does.</font>

491
00:36:54,422 --> 00:36:55,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's why you have it.</font>

492
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I don't remember
ever meeting Zobrist.</font>

493
00:36:57,447 --> 00:36:59,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a lot you don't remember.</font>

494
00:36:59,788 --> 00:37:03,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe they-
Maybe they came to you.</font>

495
00:37:03,974 --> 00:37:05,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wanted your help with the path.</font>

496
00:37:05,615 --> 00:37:07,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Because I lectured on Dante?
- Exactly.</font>

497
00:37:07,608 --> 00:37:11,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">They showed you this Faraday pointer,
tried to convince you of their cause.</font>

498
00:37:11,878 --> 00:37:14,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mass murder?
- You said you found him compelling.</font>

499
00:37:14,456 --> 00:37:16,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">His argument!</font>

500
00:37:16,045 --> 00:37:17,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">His rhetoric.</font>

501
00:37:17,817 --> 00:37:20,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not his plan!
Zobrist is a psychopath.</font>

502
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:21,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, maybe they tricked you.</font>

503
00:37:21,623 --> 00:37:24,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sent...
someone you knew.</font>

504
00:37:24,601 --> 00:37:27,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a minute to midnight.</font>

505
00:37:33,838 --> 00:37:36,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is that for us?
- Logic would suggest.</font>

506
00:37:51,282 --> 00:37:52,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn it!</font>

507
00:37:54,614 --> 00:37:56,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here, come on.
Follow me.</font>

508
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:58,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">We could get there
through the garden.</font>

509
00:38:06,791 --> 00:38:10,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, the-
the Palazzo Vecchio is this way.</font>

510
00:38:14,813 --> 00:38:18,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">We just flagged the car charged to
her credit card within the past hour.</font>

511
00:38:18,454 --> 00:38:20,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">Antoine, did you talk to the police?</font>

512
00:38:20,262 --> 00:38:22,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are people who have seen me.</font>

513
00:38:22,324 --> 00:38:26,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please cooperate with local police officially.</font>

514
00:38:29,809 --> 00:38:34,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">W.H.O. will take charge overseeing
the search at the Boboli Gardens.</font>

515
00:38:37,981 --> 00:38:40,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">Call in the search dogs.</font>

516
00:38:40,402 --> 00:38:46,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got called out from the
police station to support you.</font>

517
00:38:56,786 --> 00:38:58,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need more people.</font>

518
00:39:06,213 --> 00:39:09,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Radio in, suspects found.</font>

519
00:39:27,713 --> 00:39:31,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn it!
Delta, check the north perimeter.</font>

520
00:39:33,394 --> 00:39:35,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a small gray door
down here.</font>

521
00:39:35,166 --> 00:39:37,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">It will take us into
the Vasari corridor.</font>

522
00:39:37,271 --> 00:39:41,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right across the Ponte Vecchio,
and into the Palazzo.</font>

523
00:39:41,255 --> 00:39:42,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's the door, see.
- Yeah.</font>

524
00:39:42,903 --> 00:39:44,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now!</font>

525
00:40:00,677 --> 00:40:02,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is the completely walled.</font>

526
00:40:02,452 --> 00:40:03,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">On all sides.</font>

527
00:40:03,824 --> 00:40:06,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">The only exits are through the Palazzo
Pitti, on the north side,</font>

528
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">and through the visitors gates
on the east and west sides.</font>

529
00:40:09,606 --> 00:40:10,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">No other way out?</font>

530
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:12,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">I suppose if you count
the Vasari gate.</font>

531
00:40:12,869 --> 00:40:15,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it's ancient,
no one knows about that.</font>

532
00:40:15,474 --> 00:40:17,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">Langdon does.</font>

533
00:40:25,362 --> 00:40:28,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Professor has become a liability, Vayentha.</font>

534
00:40:28,228 --> 00:40:32,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">The provost has issued a kill order.
Eliminate Langdon.</font>

535
00:40:32,806 --> 00:40:37,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fail, and you will be held accountable.
Am I making myself clear?</font>

536
00:40:37,286 --> 00:40:39,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">Copy that, sir.</font>

537
00:40:56,994 --> 00:40:58,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">There.</font>

538
00:40:58,077 --> 00:41:01,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the Vasari fresco,
The Battle of Marciano.</font>

539
00:41:41,206 --> 00:41:44,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">There. There.
Look. Look, look, look.</font>

540
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, see the 2 farmhouses,
dead center up high,</font>

541
00:41:47,791 --> 00:41:49,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">come down to it's 4 o'clock,</font>

542
00:41:49,547 --> 00:41:52,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you'll see a small green flag.</font>

543
00:41:52,173 --> 00:41:54,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Cerca trova.
- Yeah.</font>

544
00:41:54,293 --> 00:41:55,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seek and find.</font>

545
00:41:55,601 --> 00:41:58,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seek and find.</font>

546
00:41:58,476 --> 00:42:00,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">We sought it and
we found it.</font>

547
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, now what?</font>

548
00:42:03,065 --> 00:42:05,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">The words Zobrist
added to the painting.</font>

549
00:42:05,367 --> 00:42:09,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">The truth can be glimpsed
only through the eyes of death.</font>

550
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eyes of death.</font>

551
00:42:13,472 --> 00:42:15,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whose's eyes?</font>

552
00:42:54,452 --> 00:42:56,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was I given an injection?</font>

553
00:42:56,442 --> 00:42:57,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">When?</font>

554
00:42:57,347 --> 00:42:59,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">- At the hospital, with a hypertenol?
- No.</font>

555
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:03,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you were intubated.
Anything you got came through the IV.</font>

556
00:43:04,893 --> 00:43:06,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not at the hospital.</font>

557
00:43:07,257 --> 00:43:10,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was fully dress.
I was in the back of some car...</font>

558
00:43:10,626 --> 00:43:12,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">at some point
in the last 2 days.</font>

559
00:43:12,907 --> 00:43:15,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">And something was injected
into my bloodstream.</font>

560
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:18,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">and now I'm showing
signs of an illness</font>

561
00:43:20,811 --> 00:43:22,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if...?</font>

562
00:43:23,864 --> 00:43:25,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if what?</font>

563
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:30,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sienna, what if I'm the carrier?</font>

564
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:32,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look.</font>

565
00:43:34,059 --> 00:43:36,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you've got it
then I've got it too.</font>

566
00:43:36,673 --> 00:43:40,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">And everyone we've come into
contact with has it and will likely die.</font>

567
00:43:40,527 --> 00:43:41,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if you don't.</font>

568
00:43:41,742 --> 00:43:46,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">If-If they gave you an anotic
or a hallucinogen or anything else.</font>

569
00:43:46,664 --> 00:43:49,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then we still have a chance
to save half the world.</font>

570
00:43:51,202 --> 00:43:53,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's worth a try, isn't it?</font>

571
00:44:02,309 --> 00:44:03,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor.</font>

572
00:44:05,103 --> 00:44:09,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, it is you.
Why are you back so soon?</font>

573
00:44:09,681 --> 00:44:12,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have no idea
who this woman is.</font>

574
00:44:12,172 --> 00:44:16,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">I almost didn't recognize you in that suit.
You've been shopping?</font>

575
00:44:18,547 --> 00:44:20,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor, you bumped your head.</font>

576
00:44:20,858 --> 00:44:24,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the shower, yes.
It's quite a tumble.</font>

577
00:44:24,697 --> 00:44:25,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ayes.
- Yeah.</font>

578
00:44:25,739 --> 00:44:29,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.
This is Sienna, my niece.</font>

579
00:44:29,831 --> 00:44:33,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're in Italy, Professor,
you don't have to say 'niece'.</font>

580
00:44:33,666 --> 00:44:35,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No. No.
- No, he's not.</font>

581
00:44:35,166 --> 00:44:39,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello.
Marta Alvarez. Pleasure to meet you.</font>

582
00:44:39,713 --> 00:44:42,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is Ignazio with you again?</font>

583
00:44:42,534 --> 00:44:44,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ignazio?
- Yeah.</font>

584
00:44:53,793 --> 00:44:56,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ignazio couldn't make it
this morning.</font>

585
00:44:56,608 --> 00:45:00,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry to bother you, Marta.
But...</font>

586
00:45:00,733 --> 00:45:06,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can imagine you know why
I'm back. Again.</font>

587
00:45:06,708 --> 00:45:08,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really?</font>

588
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:11,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of all the treasures in the Palazzo.</font>

589
00:45:11,507 --> 00:45:15,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">He and il Duomino spent almost an hour
with it up there last night.</font>

590
00:45:16,016 --> 00:45:18,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's-It's so morbid.</font>

591
00:45:18,974 --> 00:45:22,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No.
It's cool.</font>

592
00:45:22,273 --> 00:45:25,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alright, come on.
I'm headed up that way.</font>

593
00:45:32,789 --> 00:45:35,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's an extremely resourceful man.</font>

594
00:45:35,047 --> 00:45:38,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was told you were
as well, Mr. Bouchard.</font>

595
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:43,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">So.
Tell me.</font>

596
00:45:43,661 --> 00:45:45,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you think he's doing?</font>

597
00:45:45,126 --> 00:45:46,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">What you think you doing?</font>

598
00:45:46,536 --> 00:45:48,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">I brought you the pointer
and now it's gone.</font>

599
00:45:48,757 --> 00:45:50,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You have a leak.
- We losed him in the street.</font>

600
00:45:50,987 --> 00:45:52,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">Reacquired him at the doctor's apartment.</font>

601
00:45:53,007 --> 00:45:54,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can handle with some ground.</font>

602
00:45:54,722 --> 00:45:57,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We don't need your help.
- What if he's injured.</font>

603
00:45:58,641 --> 00:46:00,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">A head wound.</font>

604
00:46:00,623 --> 00:46:01,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?
You think he's confused.</font>

605
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He doesn't know what he's doing?
- It's possible.</font>

606
00:46:04,612 --> 00:46:08,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">How far did he get
the night before he disappeared?</font>

607
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:10,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">To the Hall of Five Hundred.</font>

608
00:46:11,818 --> 00:46:13,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">So let's stop chasing him,</font>

609
00:46:14,311 --> 00:46:16,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">anticipate him instead.</font>

610
00:46:28,559 --> 00:46:31,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa, inspector.
Not so fast, please.</font>

611
00:46:31,802 --> 00:46:33,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm about to burst.</font>

612
00:46:33,942 --> 00:46:37,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Such a romantic date he takes you on.
To see a death mask.</font>

613
00:46:37,184 --> 00:46:39,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, they were common practice
in the 1500s.</font>

614
00:46:39,902 --> 00:46:43,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's essentially just a
plaster cast of someone's face,</font>

615
00:46:43,887 --> 00:46:47,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">made a few moments
after that person dies.</font>

616
00:46:47,465 --> 00:46:49,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Through the eyes of death."</font>

617
00:46:49,108 --> 00:46:53,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">The person who was used for this mask,
the poet,</font>

618
00:46:53,507 --> 00:46:55,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dante.</font>

619
00:46:56,748 --> 00:46:59,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is a romantic story I supposed.</font>

620
00:46:59,306 --> 00:47:03,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dante loved Florence,
he was prominent and powerful. But...</font>

621
00:47:03,286 --> 00:47:06,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">The political winds changed
and he was exiled.</font>

622
00:47:06,181 --> 00:47:09,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">They threatened to burn him
at the stake if he ever returned.</font>

623
00:47:09,478 --> 00:47:15,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, some people say Dante's exile
is the reason his death mask looks so sad.</font>

624
00:47:15,684 --> 00:47:19,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No.
It was because of Beatrice.</font>

625
00:47:19,791 --> 00:47:24,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dante only knew her from afar but
he was obsessed with her his entire life.</font>

626
00:47:24,572 --> 00:47:27,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your niece is a romantic, Professor.</font>

627
00:47:27,851 --> 00:47:32,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">They say Dante wrote in fact about
his journey out of hell to reach her.</font>

628
00:47:32,842 --> 00:47:34,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">But he never made it.</font>

629
00:47:35,527 --> 00:47:37,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">She married someone else.</font>

630
00:47:37,914 --> 00:47:39,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">That happens.</font>

631
00:47:39,856 --> 00:47:41,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does it?</font>

632
00:47:41,581 --> 00:47:43,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who left who?</font>

633
00:47:43,489 --> 00:47:46,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">Things fall apart if
you don't look after them.</font>

634
00:47:46,302 --> 00:47:49,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. We ask that you stay
behind the stanchions. Please.</font>

635
00:47:49,793 --> 00:47:50,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

636
00:47:50,664 --> 00:47:53,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good timing, Professor.
We've only just opened.</font>

637
00:47:58,418 --> 00:47:59,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">Marta...</font>

638
00:47:59,621 --> 00:48:01,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes?</font>

639
00:48:36,255 --> 00:48:37,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">There.
That's us.</font>

640
00:48:41,862 --> 00:48:43,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's Ignazio Busoni.</font>

641
00:48:44,175 --> 00:48:45,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've known him for years.</font>

642
00:48:45,581 --> 00:48:47,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's the Dante scholar.</font>

643
00:48:49,568 --> 00:48:53,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">The mask's owner insists on the
stanchions to keep people back.</font>

644
00:48:53,731 --> 00:48:56,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">He doesn't even permit staff to open
the case without him present.</font>

645
00:48:56,998 --> 00:48:59,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">So the mask is not owned
by the museum?</font>

646
00:48:59,916 --> 00:49:01,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.
A private collector bought it from us,</font>

647
00:49:01,963 --> 00:49:04,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">and allows us to
display it in perpetuity.</font>

648
00:49:04,313 --> 00:49:07,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a common practice,
to raise funds.</font>

649
00:49:08,608 --> 00:49:09,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who is the collector?</font>

650
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:13,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bertram Zobrist, the billionaire.</font>

651
00:49:13,382 --> 00:49:18,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">His ideas were quite eccentric,
but still it's such a shame what happened.</font>

652
00:49:19,349 --> 00:49:21,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's when I got the call.</font>

653
00:49:49,704 --> 00:49:51,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

654
00:49:51,237 --> 00:49:54,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor, I...
I don't know what to think!</font>

655
00:49:54,434 --> 00:49:56,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am appalled!</font>

656
00:50:07,369 --> 00:50:09,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Professor.
- Professor Langdon.</font>

657
00:50:09,797 --> 00:50:13,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look.
There's an explanation for all this.</font>

658
00:50:25,474 --> 00:50:26,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll be right back.</font>

659
00:50:26,706 --> 00:50:29,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">Marta, don't let them go.</font>

660
00:50:46,827 --> 00:50:48,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor.</font>

661
00:50:48,391 --> 00:50:52,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor, I very much respect you
but I do not understand.</font>

662
00:50:52,331 --> 00:50:54,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Please sit down. I'm going to explain this.
- Why you have done this?</font>

663
00:50:54,523 --> 00:50:57,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This is not okay.
- Marta, I do not know where the mask is.</font>

664
00:50:57,349 --> 00:51:00,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I will do everything I can
to find it and return it to you.</font>

665
00:51:00,121 --> 00:51:03,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor, what are you doing?
Professor, please. No.</font>

666
00:51:03,117 --> 00:51:05,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor, come back.
Don't do that.</font>

667
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:06,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor, please don't.</font>

668
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey. Hey.
- Professor.</font>

669
00:51:08,123 --> 00:51:11,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Just don't follow us.
- Please, don't do this.</font>

670
00:51:13,226 --> 00:51:14,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor!</font>

671
00:51:22,983 --> 00:51:25,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's just calmly
find a way out of here.</font>

672
00:51:30,730 --> 00:51:33,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why didn't you tell me about Ignazio?</font>

673
00:51:33,744 --> 00:51:36,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you help me
if you knew I was a thief?</font>

674
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:37,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">You lied to me when
you asked for my help.</font>

675
00:51:37,739 --> 00:51:39,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well technically, I withheld.</font>

676
00:51:43,427 --> 00:51:44,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I really took that mask...</font>

677
00:51:44,884 --> 00:51:46,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">You did take the mask,
I just saw you.</font>

678
00:51:46,528 --> 00:51:50,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is not your problem.
You don't have to stay.</font>

679
00:51:50,168 --> 00:51:53,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course, I do.
Human lives are at stake.</font>

680
00:51:53,393 --> 00:51:55,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just want to know that
I'm on the right side.</font>

681
00:51:55,153 --> 00:51:56,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are.</font>

682
00:51:57,152 --> 00:51:58,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">I swear.</font>

683
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:00,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good.</font>

684
00:52:00,711 --> 00:52:03,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now let's find what
we're looking for.</font>

685
00:52:03,396 --> 00:52:07,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Call this Ignazio, and ask him
where he hid the mask.</font>

686
00:52:12,617 --> 00:52:15,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ignazio's disappeared.
He had gone into hiding.</font>

687
00:52:15,706 --> 00:52:16,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said.</font>

688
00:52:16,739 --> 00:52:19,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">They were chasing him too
but he left a clue.</font>

689
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:25,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">An email,
"Paradise Twenty-five".</font>

690
00:52:25,135 --> 00:52:28,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a reference to Dante's Divine Comedy.
"Canto XXV." But...</font>

691
00:52:28,583 --> 00:52:31,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I need a copy of the book.
- A copy of the book.</font>

692
00:52:31,228 --> 00:52:34,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's quaint.
I use Google.</font>

693
00:52:34,313 --> 00:52:37,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're closing down the museum,
only the main exit is going to be open.</font>

694
00:52:38,039 --> 00:52:40,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, then we'll go through Armenia.</font>

695
00:53:06,918 --> 00:53:08,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">All exit doors are now sealed.</font>

696
00:53:08,807 --> 00:53:10,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the only way
in or out.</font>

697
00:53:10,610 --> 00:53:14,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about hidden exits?
Tunnels, concealed doorways?</font>

698
00:53:14,032 --> 00:53:17,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a 700 year old Palazzo, Signore,
there are a number of them.</font>

699
00:53:17,972 --> 00:53:19,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">Show me.</font>

700
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:46,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor.
How worldly.</font>

701
00:53:46,782 --> 00:53:48,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">Secrets of the Palazzo Invisibile.</font>

702
00:53:48,481 --> 00:53:51,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a great tour,
you should take it sometime.</font>

703
00:53:52,875 --> 00:53:55,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should be safe here
for a minute.</font>

704
00:54:02,166 --> 00:54:03,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go.</font>

705
00:54:07,637 --> 00:54:09,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">By then with other voice,
with other fleece...</font>

706
00:54:09,898 --> 00:54:14,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">I shall return as poet and put on,
at my baptismal font, the laurel crown...</font>

707
00:54:14,617 --> 00:54:15,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">Baptismal font.</font>

708
00:54:15,672 --> 00:54:18,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">Il Duomo.
The Cathedral where Dante was baptized.</font>

709
00:54:18,418 --> 00:54:22,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's where Ignazio works.
That's where he hid the mask.</font>

710
00:54:27,884 --> 00:54:30,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're going to think
we're heading down to the exit.</font>

711
00:54:32,333 --> 00:54:34,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then we go up.</font>

712
00:54:50,748 --> 00:54:52,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alright.</font>

713
00:54:54,262 --> 00:54:56,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're right above the
Hall of Five Hundred.</font>

714
00:54:56,766 --> 00:54:59,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a stairway leading down
to the street on the other side.</font>

715
00:54:59,994 --> 00:55:01,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">So.</font>

716
00:55:01,771 --> 00:55:04,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">One step at a time.</font>

717
00:55:13,603 --> 00:55:14,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay?</font>

718
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you afraid of heights?</font>

719
00:55:20,242 --> 00:55:21,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">A little.</font>

720
00:55:21,523 --> 00:55:24,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm uncomfortable in tight spaces.</font>

721
00:55:25,434 --> 00:55:27,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, don't look down.</font>

722
00:55:27,293 --> 00:55:30,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or do.
I can never remember which.</font>

723
00:56:07,442 --> 00:56:09,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not that hard.</font>

724
00:56:24,065 --> 00:56:25,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sienna!</font>

725
00:56:35,579 --> 00:56:37,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you alright?</font>

726
00:56:37,318 --> 00:56:38,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You okay?
- Yeah.</font>

727
00:56:38,981 --> 00:56:42,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alright, just...
crawl along that beam there.</font>

728
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:44,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'll meet you on the
far side, by the ladder.</font>

729
00:56:52,224 --> 00:56:53,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir.</font>

730
00:56:53,565 --> 00:56:57,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me a six men stationed here.
Safeties off.</font>

731
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:10,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're being stupid now, Professor Langdon!</font>

732
00:57:10,967 --> 00:57:13,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go. Go.
Get out of here, go!</font>

733
00:57:16,307 --> 00:57:19,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">They needed you but now
they changed their minds.</font>

734
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:56,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get these people out.
Everyone out, clear the room.</font>

735
00:58:09,885 --> 00:58:11,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me that.</font>

736
00:58:13,753 --> 00:58:15,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">These doors, here.</font>

737
00:58:15,971 --> 00:58:18,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Eastern side. That's where they're headed.
- Okay.</font>

738
00:58:18,586 --> 00:58:20,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go, move.
Quickly!</font>

739
00:59:10,954 --> 00:59:14,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bouchard.
Agent Bouchard, come in.</font>

740
00:59:15,597 --> 00:59:19,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is your location?
Agent Bouchard, come in.</font>

741
00:59:21,728 --> 00:59:25,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">That same word is on the envelope
the video arrived in,</font>

742
00:59:25,315 --> 00:59:28,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">along with the date.
The date is tomorrow.</font>

743
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:32,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, thank you,
that was not lost on me.</font>

744
00:59:33,347 --> 00:59:36,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">The darkest places in hell
are reserved for those</font>

745
00:59:36,416 --> 00:59:39,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">who refuse to act in
time of moral crisis.</font>

746
00:59:40,030 --> 00:59:44,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dante's hell isn't fiction anymore,
it's prophecy.</font>

747
00:59:44,673 --> 00:59:47,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have created
our own hell on earth.</font>

748
00:59:48,007 --> 00:59:49,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh my.</font>

749
00:59:49,797 --> 00:59:53,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">The warnings have been obvious,
the solutions ignored.</font>

750
00:59:53,096 --> 00:59:55,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, I took action.</font>

751
00:59:55,619 --> 00:59:59,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you are watching this,
it means the Inferno virus was released</font>

752
00:59:59,824 --> 01:00:02,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">last night at midnight,
and...</font>

753
01:00:02,242 --> 01:00:05,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's now being carried to
every corner of the Earth.</font>

754
01:00:05,152 --> 01:00:06,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh my.</font>

755
01:00:06,976 --> 01:00:11,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">Within 6 days of it's released,
the virus will replicate itself.</font>

756
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:15,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">And every man, woman and child
on Earth expect the current...</font>

757
01:00:16,143 --> 01:00:20,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">the current population
to be culled by half.</font>

758
01:00:20,409 --> 01:00:23,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">The survivors will witness</font>

759
01:00:24,670 --> 01:00:29,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">horrors...
unknown to this planet.</font>

760
01:00:30,411 --> 01:00:33,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I want them to know why.</font>

761
01:00:33,097 --> 01:00:37,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">That this was our doing
and this is our salvation.</font>

762
01:00:37,965 --> 01:00:39,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now is the time.</font>

763
01:00:41,458 --> 01:00:42,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">Today is...</font>

764
01:00:43,367 --> 01:00:44,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's more.</font>

765
01:00:44,418 --> 01:00:46,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe I've got the gist.</font>

766
01:00:47,141 --> 01:00:48,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">It appears our organization has spent</font>

767
01:00:48,909 --> 01:00:51,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">the last several years
in the employ of a madman</font>

768
01:00:51,759 --> 01:00:55,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">who now intends to commit a mass murder
using a deadly plague of his own creation</font>

769
01:00:55,425 --> 01:00:58,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">in some point in the next 24...
Sorry.</font>

770
01:00:58,751 --> 01:01:00,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Less than 12 hours.</font>

771
01:01:01,213 --> 01:01:04,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, let's do our level best
not to fuck things up</font>

772
01:01:04,110 --> 01:01:08,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">any worse than we already have,
shall we?</font>

773
01:01:08,563 --> 01:01:12,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Without the Faraday pointer,
no one can find the virus.</font>

774
01:01:12,235 --> 01:01:13,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is Professor Langdon now?</font>

775
01:01:13,838 --> 01:01:17,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was with Dr. Brooks in the Boboli Gardens
but we seemed to have lost visual.</font>

776
01:01:17,525 --> 01:01:20,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'm afraid we have
no contact from Vayentha.</font>

777
01:01:20,213 --> 01:01:21,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see.</font>

778
01:01:22,295 --> 01:01:24,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to Florence myself.</font>

779
01:01:35,643 --> 01:01:39,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">Test her for signs of contagion
and quarantine this place.</font>

780
01:01:40,943 --> 01:01:42,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we don't find Langdon very soon,</font>

781
01:01:42,788 --> 01:01:45,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">we are going to be looking at
a great many more dead bodies.</font>

782
01:02:09,936 --> 01:02:11,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you alright?</font>

783
01:02:12,784 --> 01:02:14,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's weakness.</font>

784
01:02:14,826 --> 01:02:17,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just weakness, god damn it.</font>

785
01:02:18,302 --> 01:02:20,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll just take a moment.</font>

786
01:02:20,175 --> 01:02:22,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you see her down there?</font>

787
01:02:23,105 --> 01:02:24,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

788
01:02:24,130 --> 01:02:27,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything I've done, every bit of
work and studies since I was eleven</font>

789
01:02:27,313 --> 01:02:29,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">is to stop death, not cause it.</font>

790
01:02:29,329 --> 01:02:32,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was self defense.
Someone was trying to kill us.</font>

791
01:02:32,416 --> 01:02:34,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know if
I can finish this.</font>

792
01:02:36,731 --> 01:02:40,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">I understand if you can't.</font>

793
01:02:41,072 --> 01:02:44,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, Zobrist is the murderer,
not you.</font>

794
01:02:45,047 --> 01:02:46,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">You saved me.</font>

795
01:02:47,532 --> 01:02:50,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have to
take another step.</font>

796
01:02:52,295 --> 01:02:54,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, you're right.</font>

797
01:02:55,065 --> 01:02:58,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did what was necessary and
I'll do it again if I need to.</font>

798
01:02:59,253 --> 01:03:01,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">I pray that you don't.</font>

799
01:03:05,414 --> 01:03:08,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like it's close for repairs.</font>

800
01:03:09,181 --> 01:03:10,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, this way.</font>

801
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:28,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">There.</font>

802
01:03:28,222 --> 01:03:30,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">The baptismal font.</font>

803
01:04:00,396 --> 01:04:02,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dante again.</font>

804
01:04:02,471 --> 01:04:04,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">Always Dante, why Dante?</font>

805
01:04:04,373 --> 01:04:07,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Acrylic gesso.
- You mean paint.</font>

806
01:04:07,217 --> 01:04:09,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">Water soluble paint.</font>

807
01:04:10,302 --> 01:04:12,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">Smells like a wet dog.</font>

808
01:04:17,733 --> 01:04:20,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at that.
There's a writing.</font>

809
01:04:20,490 --> 01:04:26,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Seek the treacherous Doge of Venice,</font>

810
01:04:27,188 --> 01:04:33,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">- who severed the heads from horses."
- Venice.</font>

811
01:04:33,798 --> 01:04:37,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where Dante was infected
with the disease that killed him.</font>

812
01:04:38,001 --> 01:04:42,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Kneel within the gilded museum
of holy wisdom,</font>

813
01:04:42,628 --> 01:04:51,469

814
01:04:51,494 --> 01:04:55,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Follow deep into the sunken palace,</font>

815
01:04:55,583 --> 01:05:00,942

816
01:05:00,967 --> 01:05:02,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">Underwater.</font>

817
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:08,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Submerged in the
blood-red waters of...</font>

818

- Professor.</font>

819
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:21,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could you please tell me
what the hell you are doing?</font>

820
01:05:23,313 --> 01:05:24,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why haven't you called in?</font>

821
01:05:24,867 --> 01:05:26,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are you?</font>

822
01:05:26,125 --> 01:05:30,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">Christoph Bouchard,
from the World Health Organization.</font>

823
01:05:30,365 --> 01:05:32,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We've met.
- We've met?</font>

824
01:05:33,094 --> 01:05:36,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">You really don't remember?
It was just 2 days ago.</font>

825
01:05:36,411 --> 01:05:38,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's suffering the effects
of a head wound.</font>

826
01:05:38,643 --> 01:05:41,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">He can't remember the events
for the last 48 hours.</font>

827
01:05:44,016 --> 01:05:47,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm the one who flew to Cambridge
and asked for your help.</font>

828
01:05:47,456 --> 01:05:50,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">I gave you the pointer
to decode.</font>

829
01:05:50,123 --> 01:05:51,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Langdon.</font>

830
01:05:51,653 --> 01:05:53,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

831
01:05:53,851 --> 01:05:57,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.
I remember.</font>

832
01:05:59,231 --> 01:06:00,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are you?</font>

833
01:06:00,277 --> 01:06:03,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was the ER doctor at the hospital
when the Professor came in.</font>

834
01:06:04,465 --> 01:06:07,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is the last thing you remember?</font>

835
01:06:07,826 --> 01:06:11,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was on the street.
I think it was here.</font>

836
01:06:12,981 --> 01:06:15,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was with a woman.</font>

837
01:06:15,025 --> 01:06:18,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And I was given an injection.
- Elizabeth Sinskey.</font>

838
01:06:18,411 --> 01:06:19,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">Elizabeth?</font>

839
01:06:19,778 --> 01:06:21,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">From the World Health Organization.</font>

840
01:06:21,697 --> 01:06:23,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know her?</font>

841
01:06:24,382 --> 01:06:25,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do.</font>

842
01:06:25,751 --> 01:06:28,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I haven't seen Elizabeth in years.</font>

843
01:06:28,391 --> 01:06:30,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's the reason
I followed you alone.</font>

844
01:06:30,161 --> 01:06:31,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you mean?</font>

845
01:06:31,114 --> 01:06:34,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe Dr. Sinskey is working
with a foreign government</font>

846
01:06:34,481 --> 01:06:36,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">to find and sell the virus.</font>

847
01:06:36,362 --> 01:06:38,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No. No.
That's not possible.</font>

848
01:06:38,634 --> 01:06:40,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">People change, Professor.</font>

849
01:06:40,514 --> 01:06:43,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been chasing
Bertrand Zobrist for 2 years.</font>

850
01:06:43,164 --> 01:06:46,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">And someone has been
working against me.</font>

851
01:06:49,114 --> 01:06:52,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's get to the point.
You know where the virus is?</font>

852
01:06:52,202 --> 01:06:55,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">I assume you have
some sort of credentials.</font>

853
01:06:55,492 --> 01:06:57,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">Call WHO if you like.</font>

854
01:06:57,289 --> 01:07:00,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Check me out,
but do it quickly.</font>

855
01:07:04,813 --> 01:07:07,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Venice.
We think it's Venice.</font>

856
01:07:07,155 --> 01:07:08,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good.</font>

857
01:07:08,387 --> 01:07:10,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's 2 hours by train.
Come on.</font>

858
01:07:10,639 --> 01:07:13,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I could find you,
so can the others.</font>

859
01:07:14,387 --> 01:07:16,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm buying you both
plane tickets to Geneva.</font>

860
01:07:16,869 --> 01:07:19,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, not Geneva.
He said Venice.</font>

861
01:07:19,449 --> 01:07:21,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard that.</font>

862
01:07:23,791 --> 01:07:25,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse us.
Please watch yourselves.</font>

863
01:07:25,847 --> 01:07:28,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">Step back, please.
Excuse us.</font>

864
01:07:29,536 --> 01:07:31,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse us.</font>

865
01:07:31,882 --> 01:07:33,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">Watch yourself, please.</font>

866
01:07:33,617 --> 01:07:37,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This is the plane to Geneva?
- Yes, but we just closed the door.</font>

867
01:07:37,295 --> 01:07:40,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep the plane at the gate.
We need to check every passenger.</font>

868
01:07:40,318 --> 01:07:42,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">That would be a waste of time.</font>

869
01:07:42,985 --> 01:07:45,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we have very little of that.</font>

870
01:07:55,601 --> 01:08:00,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">3 days ago, after 2 years
of searching, I found Zobrist.</font>

871
01:08:00,186 --> 01:08:03,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">He killed himself.
But we took a package from his pocket.</font>

872
01:08:04,012 --> 01:08:05,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what was in it?</font>

873
01:08:05,217 --> 01:08:08,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Faraday pointer
with the map of hell.</font>

874
01:08:08,219 --> 01:08:12,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">A puzzle, specifically designed
for his followers to solve.</font>

875
01:08:12,833 --> 01:08:14,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">We brought it to you.</font>

876
01:08:14,474 --> 01:08:16,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you were in the
process of decoding it,</font>

877
01:08:16,279 --> 01:08:18,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">when you were kidnapped.</font>

878
01:08:20,270 --> 01:08:22,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Langdon.</font>

879
01:08:28,739 --> 01:08:32,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You were with Dr. Sinskey at the time.
- Elizabeth, yes.</font>

880
01:08:32,784 --> 01:08:36,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did she tell you about any
third party interest in the virus?</font>

881
01:08:38,779 --> 01:08:41,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I don't remember.
- Did she have financial problems?</font>

882
01:08:41,698 --> 01:08:42,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, I don't know.</font>

883
01:08:42,867 --> 01:08:44,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did she carry more
than one cellphone?</font>

884
01:08:44,510 --> 01:08:45,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

885
01:08:45,493 --> 01:08:46,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Think.
- He doesn't remember.</font>

886
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:52,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then tell me who can remember, Professor!
Enough with the "I don't know, I don't remember."!</font>

887
01:08:52,109 --> 01:08:54,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not good for him.</font>

888
01:08:55,712 --> 01:08:58,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">The "gilded museum,"
is that Saint Mark's.</font>

889
01:08:58,399 --> 01:09:00,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">All of Venice is a museum.</font>

890
01:09:00,222 --> 01:09:04,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">St. Mark's has the Horses of Constantinople,
they're bronze statues.</font>

891
01:09:04,721 --> 01:09:06,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I see that?</font>

892
01:09:10,387 --> 01:09:12,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wouldn't touch it.</font>

893
01:09:12,315 --> 01:09:14,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wasn't planning on it.</font>

894
01:09:22,603 --> 01:09:24,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor.</font>

895
01:09:26,322 --> 01:09:28,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Langdon.</font>

896
01:09:28,131 --> 01:09:29,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Langdon.</font>

897
01:09:29,918 --> 01:09:31,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Langdon.</font>

898
01:09:32,845 --> 01:09:34,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

899
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:37,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Robert.</font>

900
01:09:39,867 --> 01:09:41,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Elizabeth.</font>

901
01:09:41,833 --> 01:09:44,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's been a long time.</font>

902
01:09:48,220 --> 01:09:50,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">Too long.</font>

903
01:09:52,042 --> 01:09:53,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">What brings you here?</font>

904
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:58,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">The WHO needs your help.</font>

905
01:09:59,146 --> 01:10:00,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">My help?</font>

906
01:10:00,274 --> 01:10:02,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope you still
remember your Dante.</font>

907
01:10:06,302 --> 01:10:08,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">What just happened?</font>

908
01:10:13,716 --> 01:10:15,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you alright?</font>

909
01:10:15,456 --> 01:10:18,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could you get some water?
He could be dehydrated.</font>

910
01:10:18,336 --> 01:10:22,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some food, maybe some fruit
or something from the machine.</font>

911
01:10:22,365 --> 01:10:24,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Quickly.
- Sure.</font>

912
01:10:24,269 --> 01:10:25,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

913
01:10:33,809 --> 01:10:36,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is he lying?
- Through his teeth.</font>

914
01:10:36,449 --> 01:10:39,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was not the one who came
to Cambridge to see me.</font>

915
01:10:52,324 --> 01:10:56,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bouchard, I need help, quickly.
I think he's collapsed.</font>

916
01:11:06,096 --> 01:11:08,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't open the door.</font>

917
01:11:09,636 --> 01:11:11,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">Langdon?</font>

918
01:11:11,967 --> 01:11:13,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you okay?</font>

919
01:11:15,418 --> 01:11:17,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Langdon, are you okay?</font>

920
01:11:29,256 --> 01:11:30,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, let's go!</font>

921
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:37,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're telling me that
for 2 years,</font>

922
01:11:37,957 --> 01:11:41,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">you and your organization
have been working against me.</font>

923
01:11:41,211 --> 01:11:42,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is correct.</font>

924
01:11:42,369 --> 01:11:44,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">To shield Bertrand Zobrist
and his research.</font>

925
01:11:44,957 --> 01:11:48,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">- To hide him, to protect him.
- Regrettably, yes.</font>

926
01:11:48,279 --> 01:11:51,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that all of my attempts
to prevent him from initiating</font>

927
01:11:51,662 --> 01:11:55,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">a worldwide pandemic
have failed because of you.</font>

928
01:11:55,810 --> 01:11:58,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">An incisive sum-up, yes.</font>

929
01:11:58,229 --> 01:12:04,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now you have the temerity to ask
that I simply decide to trust you?</font>

930
01:12:04,489 --> 01:12:08,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm terribly sorry,
I didn't see any other way.</font>

931
01:12:12,310 --> 01:12:16,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who exactly does
your group work for?</font>

932
01:12:19,212 --> 01:12:21,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our clients, of course.</font>

933
01:12:21,346 --> 01:12:25,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are a private security firm.
A very successful one.</font>

934
01:12:25,529 --> 01:12:27,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">May I ask,</font>

935
01:12:28,020 --> 01:12:31,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">the gentleman who was with you,
agent Bouchard,</font>

936
01:12:31,979 --> 01:12:33,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">where is he now?</font>

937
01:12:35,146 --> 01:12:37,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't know.
We lost track of him.</font>

938
01:12:38,193 --> 01:12:40,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then the situation is
worse than you think.</font>

939
01:12:40,573 --> 01:12:43,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is only one reason
he would move out of contact,</font>

940
01:12:43,412 --> 01:12:45,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">he wants Mr. Langdon to himself.</font>

941
01:12:45,564 --> 01:12:46,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

942
01:12:46,509 --> 01:12:49,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">To find the virus and sell it
to the highest bidder I assume.</font>

943
01:12:49,716 --> 01:12:52,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leverage, blackmail,
you know, the usual shit.</font>

944
01:12:52,815 --> 01:12:55,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think we have anything
further to discuss, Mr. Sims.</font>

945
01:12:55,975 --> 01:12:59,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I have less than 8 hours
to find this pathogen, excuse me.</font>

946
01:12:59,287 --> 01:13:03,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">From what I understand,
you knew the Professor sometime ago.</font>

947
01:13:05,427 --> 01:13:07,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Personally.</font>

948
01:13:08,765 --> 01:13:10,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">You care about him.</font>

949
01:13:11,963 --> 01:13:18,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">You would even ally with an unscrupulous character
such as myself to protect him, wouldn't you?</font>

950
01:13:22,029 --> 01:13:26,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">My organization has the resources
to find your Professor.</font>

951
01:13:53,386 --> 01:13:56,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you wanted to start a plague,
this is where you do it.</font>

952
01:13:56,552 --> 01:13:57,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yep.</font>

953
01:13:58,386 --> 01:14:02,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">20 million people a year come here
from every corner of the globe.</font>

954
01:14:02,261 --> 01:14:06,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">During the Black Death,
the Venetians made all the ships</font>

955
01:14:06,226 --> 01:14:08,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">anchored in the harbor
for 40 days,</font>

956
01:14:08,113 --> 01:14:10,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">before they would allow
the crews into the city.</font>

957
01:14:10,211 --> 01:14:13,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Making sure that they were not
carrying the Plague.</font>

958
01:14:13,149 --> 01:14:15,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">The word "Quarantine"
comes from the Italian.</font>

959
01:14:15,340 --> 01:14:18,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">"quaranta",
"forty".</font>

960
01:14:18,476 --> 01:14:21,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's nice to have you back, Professor.</font>

961
01:14:22,018 --> 01:14:25,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">There, the horses.</font>

962
01:14:31,795 --> 01:14:35,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">These were recreations, the originals
are in a museum for preservation.</font>

963
01:14:35,787 --> 01:14:38,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should be quick.
Bouchard knows we are coming here.</font>

964
01:14:39,895 --> 01:14:41,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me.</font>

965
01:14:41,813 --> 01:14:45,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ask that guide, if the heads have
ever been severed from these horses?</font>

966
01:14:45,609 --> 01:14:48,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me.
Excuse me.</font>

967
01:14:48,666 --> 01:14:50,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Excuse me.
- Please excuse me.</font>

968
01:14:50,515 --> 01:14:51,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please.</font>

969
01:15:00,418 --> 01:15:02,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">According to the tale,
during the Crusades,</font>

970
01:15:02,125 --> 01:15:05,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">the horses were looted
from Constantinople.</font>

971
01:15:08,293 --> 01:15:10,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Horses...</font>

972
01:15:11,917 --> 01:15:14,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">But they were too large to be
loaded on board the ships,</font>

973
01:15:17,046 --> 01:15:19,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">so their heads were removed
and reattached.</font>

974
01:15:19,525 --> 01:15:21,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">By whom?</font>

975
01:15:21,449 --> 01:15:24,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">The doge who lived forever,
Enrico Dandolo.</font>

976
01:15:24,033 --> 01:15:26,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Enrico Dandolo.
- The doge who lived forever.</font>

977
01:15:26,917 --> 01:15:28,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course, Enrico Dandolo.</font>

978
01:15:28,529 --> 01:15:30,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dandolo tricked the Venetians
into the Crusades.</font>

979
01:15:30,810 --> 01:15:35,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was supposed to sail his ships to Egypt,
but he sacked Constantinople instead.</font>

980
01:15:35,716 --> 01:15:37,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.
Of course.</font>

981
01:15:37,877 --> 01:15:40,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">"The gilded museum of holy wisdom."</font>

982
01:15:41,506 --> 01:15:43,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are we in the wrong basilica?</font>

983
01:15:43,510 --> 01:15:45,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're in the wrong country.</font>

984
01:15:46,229 --> 01:15:48,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dandolo passed,
but he was not buried here.</font>

985
01:15:48,538 --> 01:15:50,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">So where was he buried?</font>

986
01:15:50,180 --> 01:15:52,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hagia Sophia.</font>

987
01:15:52,448 --> 01:15:54,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Istanbul.
- Istanbul.</font>

988
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:42,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's always a way out.</font>

989
01:16:43,978 --> 01:16:45,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here.
Here.</font>

990
01:16:52,533 --> 01:16:54,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">See if you could get that open.</font>

991
01:16:57,426 --> 01:16:59,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got your foot.</font>

992
01:17:15,207 --> 01:17:16,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you get it?</font>

993
01:17:30,256 --> 01:17:31,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is there someone there?</font>

994
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:33,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please help.</font>

995
01:17:38,765 --> 01:17:40,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

996
01:17:40,295 --> 01:17:41,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me a hand.</font>

997
01:17:41,958 --> 01:17:44,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">- One hundred.
- Yes! Yes.</font>

998
01:17:44,279 --> 01:17:46,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">- A hundred euro.
- Here. I got it. I got it.</font>

999
01:17:55,260 --> 01:17:56,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quick. Quick. Quick.</font>

1000
01:18:18,768 --> 01:18:20,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

1001
01:18:41,095 --> 01:18:42,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

1002
01:18:43,953 --> 01:18:48,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">You called him a murderer,
a psychopath.</font>

1003
01:18:49,432 --> 01:18:50,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

1004
01:18:50,827 --> 01:18:53,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">But history will call us saviors.</font>

1005
01:18:56,427 --> 01:19:00,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh my god.
Oh my god.</font>

1006
01:19:01,765 --> 01:19:04,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not afraid to die, Robert.</font>

1007
01:19:07,261 --> 01:19:10,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">But doing nothing terrifies me.</font>

1008
01:19:10,034 --> 01:19:15,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">The path, and the pointer,
he left that all for you, Zobrist.</font>

1009
01:19:16,365 --> 01:19:19,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You knew him?
- Knew him?</font>

1010
01:19:19,904 --> 01:19:22,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">I loved him.</font>

1011
01:19:22,615 --> 01:19:25,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're wearing his suit.</font>

1012
01:19:25,918 --> 01:19:28,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.
Sienna, no.</font>

1013
01:19:28,333 --> 01:19:30,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, Robert.</font>

1014
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:34,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you for everything.</font>

1015
01:19:36,065 --> 01:19:39,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No.
Sienna, no!</font>

1016
01:19:40,546 --> 01:19:42,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sienna!</font>

1017
01:19:42,604 --> 01:19:45,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Sienna!
Sienna, no!</font>

1018
01:20:13,542 --> 01:20:16,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">Slow down, slow down.
You're too fast.</font>

1019
01:20:39,569 --> 01:20:41,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, come on.
Come on.</font>

1020
01:20:41,649 --> 01:20:43,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">This took me 3 days.</font>

1021
01:20:43,916 --> 01:20:45,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Too easy.</font>

1022
01:20:45,694 --> 01:20:47,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">THE
AGE</font>

1023
01:20:55,989 --> 01:20:57,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love it.</font>

1024
01:21:08,795 --> 01:21:11,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything before you exist,</font>

1025
01:21:13,380 --> 01:21:15,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">an idea.</font>

1026
01:21:17,686 --> 01:21:19,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now it's real.</font>

1027
01:21:21,810 --> 01:21:26,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">Love awakens the soul to act.</font>

1028
01:21:31,595 --> 01:21:36,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not fair.
Quoting Dante to me.</font>

1029
01:21:39,315 --> 01:21:43,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it's beauty, not love.</font>

1030
01:21:58,856 --> 01:22:00,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

1031
01:22:03,614 --> 01:22:05,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a minute to midnight.</font>

1032
01:22:08,594 --> 01:22:11,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sooner than I expected.</font>

1033
01:22:14,862 --> 01:22:16,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where're we going?</font>

1034
01:22:23,277 --> 01:22:24,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

1035
01:22:26,349 --> 01:22:28,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see.</font>

1036
01:22:30,886 --> 01:22:36,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">We planned it together,
we designed it together,</font>

1037
01:22:38,574 --> 01:22:41,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">but this part
only belongs to you.</font>

1038
01:22:41,115 --> 01:22:45,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just safer if
you don't know where.</font>

1039
01:22:48,220 --> 01:22:50,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if they find you first?</font>

1040
01:22:53,807 --> 01:22:55,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">What then?</font>

1041
01:22:59,904 --> 01:23:02,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you want to know,
you're not alone.</font>

1042
01:23:03,698 --> 01:23:05,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got to start by trusting me.</font>

1043
01:23:05,889 --> 01:23:09,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unless we take bold immediate action</font>

1044
01:23:09,042 --> 01:23:13,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">the sixth extinction
will be our own.</font>

1045
01:23:26,515 --> 01:23:28,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were right.</font>

1046
01:23:31,043 --> 01:23:33,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to make
you another path.</font>

1047
01:23:35,697 --> 01:23:37,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">Inferno will be at the end.</font>

1048
01:23:37,962 --> 01:23:43,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">If something should happen to me,
the first clue will be deliver to you.</font>

1049
01:23:43,270 --> 01:23:46,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you'll do
what must to be done.</font>

1050
01:23:46,675 --> 01:23:48,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seek and find.</font>

1051
01:23:52,841 --> 01:23:54,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not alone.</font>

1052
01:24:58,208 --> 01:24:59,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">So.</font>

1053
01:24:59,904 --> 01:25:03,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">The beautiful young woman
went for the bad guy.</font>

1054
01:25:04,364 --> 01:25:06,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">That happens.</font>

1055
01:25:07,739 --> 01:25:09,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">You look disappointed.</font>

1056
01:25:11,458 --> 01:25:13,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll give you a minute.</font>

1057
01:25:13,070 --> 01:25:18,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">Elizabeth is not the one
who wants the virus to sell.</font>

1058
01:25:18,659 --> 01:25:20,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are.</font>

1059
01:25:21,279 --> 01:25:23,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've been used.</font>

1060
01:25:24,112 --> 01:25:28,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">Elaborate schemes created by people
to get you to do what they want.</font>

1061
01:25:30,422 --> 01:25:32,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">But me,</font>

1062
01:25:33,838 --> 01:25:35,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm very direct.</font>

1063
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:39,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">And this is a moment of
great opportunity for me.</font>

1064
01:25:39,418 --> 01:25:42,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, where is the virus?</font>

1065
01:25:47,673 --> 01:25:49,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, Professor.</font>

1066
01:25:50,220 --> 01:25:52,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">How much life is
there in the world?</font>

1067
01:25:53,704 --> 01:25:56,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">How much more is fighting
to be born?</font>

1068
01:25:59,168 --> 01:26:02,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing wrong with thinning
the herd once in a while.</font>

1069
01:26:08,105 --> 01:26:09,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's healthy.</font>

1070
01:26:11,918 --> 01:26:14,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've seen many acts of god.</font>

1071
01:26:14,670 --> 01:26:19,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, typhoons, cholera.
And you know what?</font>

1072
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:23,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes it hits the right people.</font>

1073
01:26:23,979 --> 01:26:27,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's inhuman.
- Humanity is inhuman.</font>

1074
01:26:27,707 --> 01:26:31,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">Life maybe cheap,
but the means to end it on a mass scale,</font>

1075
01:26:31,203 --> 01:26:33,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">no one ever stops
paying for that.</font>

1076
01:26:41,591 --> 01:26:44,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to ask you
for the last...</font>

1077
01:26:48,301 --> 01:26:50,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">Terribly sorry.</font>

1078
01:26:53,140 --> 01:26:55,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Didn't see any other way.</font>

1079
01:26:56,342 --> 01:27:00,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">Must do this quickly.
The less blood the better.</font>

1080
01:27:01,350 --> 01:27:03,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are you?</font>

1081
01:27:04,217 --> 01:27:06,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, a facilitator.</font>

1082
01:27:06,842 --> 01:27:10,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Among other things
my company creates illusions.</font>

1083
01:27:10,082 --> 01:27:12,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">You never had
a real head wound.</font>

1084
01:27:14,775 --> 01:27:19,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But I lost my memory.
- Chemically induced.</font>

1085
01:27:19,779 --> 01:27:23,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">We gave you an injection
of benzodiazapenes.</font>

1086
01:27:23,810 --> 01:27:28,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, it can produce a skin rash.
It should fade in a day or so.</font>

1087
01:27:32,279 --> 01:27:34,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">All this was a...</font>

1088
01:27:34,475 --> 01:27:36,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">All this was a fake?</font>

1089
01:27:36,082 --> 01:27:39,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">I prefer created reality.</font>

1090
01:27:39,175 --> 01:27:43,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">My agents kidnapped you.</font>

1091
01:27:43,435 --> 01:27:47,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">They cleared your memories so
we could create a fresh scenario,</font>

1092
01:27:47,176 --> 01:27:50,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">whereby you would be
invested in the idea of helping us.</font>

1093
01:27:52,104 --> 01:27:57,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">A small incision was made in your scalp
to give the impression of a bullet graze.</font>

1094
01:27:59,377 --> 01:28:01,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are no locks on hospital doors.</font>

1095
01:28:01,951 --> 01:28:03,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Exactly.</font>

1096
01:28:03,682 --> 01:28:04,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Highest marks.</font>

1097
01:28:05,015 --> 01:28:08,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about the policewoman who shot
the Doctor in the hospital?</font>

1098
01:28:08,502 --> 01:28:09,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Also it's me.</font>

1099
01:28:09,765 --> 01:28:11,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her gun fired blanks.</font>

1100
01:28:12,024 --> 01:28:14,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">And there were squibs in the door.</font>

1101
01:28:14,279 --> 01:28:16,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">The doctor was an agent
wearing a blood packet.</font>

1102
01:28:16,376 --> 01:28:20,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">The taxi driver, the hospital
was working for us as well.</font>

1103
01:28:20,703 --> 01:28:23,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">At the Palazzo Vecchio
she tried to kill me.</font>

1104
01:28:24,139 --> 01:28:26,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was real bullets.</font>

1105
01:28:26,625 --> 01:28:28,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">At my behest.</font>

1106
01:28:28,595 --> 01:28:31,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">When things that appeared
to go tits up</font>

1107
01:28:31,047 --> 01:28:33,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">I try to sweep it
all away quickly.</font>

1108
01:28:33,203 --> 01:28:34,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">By killing me?</font>

1109
01:28:34,503 --> 01:28:38,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">I apologize unreservedly, Mr. Langdon.</font>

1110
01:28:45,181 --> 01:28:47,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did lose an experienced agent.</font>

1111
01:28:49,029 --> 01:28:53,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a great deal of situation
I've been informed in my line of work.</font>

1112
01:28:54,796 --> 01:28:57,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, hear me what I know.</font>

1113
01:28:57,610 --> 01:29:00,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know I've behaved terribly.</font>

1114
01:29:03,127 --> 01:29:07,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">But a puzzle needed solving,
who better to solve it than you.</font>

1115
01:29:08,421 --> 01:29:10,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">Glance at it, will you?</font>

1116
01:29:23,725 --> 01:29:25,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not my best work.</font>

1117
01:29:26,545 --> 01:29:29,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it will do for the Italians.</font>

1118
01:29:30,091 --> 01:29:35,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">Zobrist had followers everywhere
when Sienna first came to me for help.</font>

1119
01:29:35,250 --> 01:29:37,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or so I thought.</font>

1120
01:29:37,238 --> 01:29:41,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">She came to us with serious concerns
shortly after Zobrist died.</font>

1121
01:29:42,905 --> 01:29:46,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somehow, she knew Zobrist had hired us.</font>

1122
01:29:46,104 --> 01:29:49,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">She said he was doing biological work
that could be fallen into the wrong hands.</font>

1123
01:29:49,770 --> 01:29:52,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">She didn't mention a plague.
But we heard enough to be alarmed.</font>

1124
01:29:52,952 --> 01:29:56,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we agreed to work with her
to find Zobrist's project.</font>

1125
01:29:56,851 --> 01:30:01,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">And when Dr. Sinskey brought you in,
we saw an opportunity.</font>

1126
01:30:01,510 --> 01:30:03,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was Elizabeth
who came to see me.</font>

1127
01:30:03,783 --> 01:30:05,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

1128
01:30:05,131 --> 01:30:09,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dr. Sinskey got the Faraday pointer
from agent Bouchard.</font>

1129
01:30:09,104 --> 01:30:11,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">She brought it
to you to decode,</font>

1130
01:30:11,345 --> 01:30:14,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">and she even secured it
with your thumbprint.</font>

1131
01:30:14,203 --> 01:30:15,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">That left us with no choice,</font>

1132
01:30:15,645 --> 01:30:18,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">so we took you from her
on the street.</font>

1133
01:30:20,127 --> 01:30:24,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">The hospital scenario encouraged you
to trust Dr. Brooks.</font>

1134
01:30:24,399 --> 01:30:28,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">When you called to the Consulate
it was answered by our man.</font>

1135
01:30:28,935 --> 01:30:30,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Langdon?</font>

1136
01:30:30,465 --> 01:30:33,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank heavens you're alive.
We've been looking for you.</font>

1137
01:30:33,134 --> 01:30:34,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you still in possession?</font>

1138
01:30:34,449 --> 01:30:36,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">You had the pointer
and we had you.</font>

1139
01:30:36,506 --> 01:30:40,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was all working seamlessly
until Miss. Brooks stole you away.</font>

1140
01:30:40,420 --> 01:30:43,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">To make sure
the virus is released.</font>

1141
01:30:44,702 --> 01:30:46,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">It appears.</font>

1142
01:30:47,368 --> 01:30:50,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">Young people are disappointing.</font>

1143
01:30:51,448 --> 01:30:54,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">I find them become
tolerable around 35.</font>

1144
01:30:57,479 --> 01:30:59,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">You mentioed Dr. Sinskey.</font>

1145
01:31:07,423 --> 01:31:09,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been so worried.</font>

1146
01:31:11,055 --> 01:31:12,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you alright?</font>

1147
01:31:12,829 --> 01:31:15,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm fine.
- Are you?</font>

1148
01:31:15,155 --> 01:31:16,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm okay.</font>

1149
01:31:17,426 --> 01:31:19,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm alright.</font>

1150
01:31:20,353 --> 01:31:22,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank god.</font>

1151
01:31:24,503 --> 01:31:27,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do you know where the virus is?
- Istanbul.</font>

1152
01:31:32,309 --> 01:31:34,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now's the time.</font>

1153
01:31:34,775 --> 01:31:37,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Today is rebirth.</font>

1154
01:31:37,256 --> 01:31:39,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">Inferno is salvation.</font>

1155
01:31:45,194 --> 01:31:47,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am so sorry I brought
you into this, Robert,</font>

1156
01:31:47,639 --> 01:31:52,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">- after all these years.
- No. I'm glad you did.</font>

1157
01:31:52,627 --> 01:31:56,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">I met him, you know.
Zobrist, 2 years ago.</font>

1158
01:31:56,210 --> 01:31:57,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">He asked for my help.</font>

1159
01:31:57,966 --> 01:32:01,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wanted the WHO to
endorse mass sterilization</font>

1160
01:32:01,314 --> 01:32:03,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">in drinking waters and staple foods.</font>

1161
01:32:03,944 --> 01:32:08,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I threw him out of my office,
put him on the watch list.</font>

1162
01:32:08,939 --> 01:32:11,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">But he disappeared and...</font>

1163
01:32:12,958 --> 01:32:16,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">I suppose that's when
Zobrist hired Sims.</font>

1164
01:32:17,255 --> 01:32:21,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should probably have... have
I don't know.</font>

1165
01:32:21,559 --> 01:32:22,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

1166
01:32:22,336 --> 01:32:26,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">You always blame yourself for things
that weren't your fault.</font>

1167
01:32:28,707 --> 01:32:31,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">Still very sweet.</font>

1168
01:32:47,359 --> 01:32:49,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here, a doorway.</font>

1169
01:33:01,171 --> 01:33:05,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish it would have happened differently,
back then.</font>

1170
01:33:07,137 --> 01:33:11,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">We didn't look after it.
It fell apart.</font>

1171
01:33:11,399 --> 01:33:13,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that a regret?</font>

1172
01:33:15,583 --> 01:33:17,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only when I think about it.</font>

1173
01:33:23,934 --> 01:33:27,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, the most interesting things
happened in doorways,</font>

1174
01:33:27,606 --> 01:33:31,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">at the borders,
right along the edges.</font>

1175
01:33:33,746 --> 01:33:38,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ancient fishermen learned to sail
where the warm water met the cold.</font>

1176
01:33:38,530 --> 01:33:42,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">The little fish would reach the edge
of the warm water and they stopped.</font>

1177
01:33:42,943 --> 01:33:45,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the big fish would come out
of the cold water and they eat them.</font>

1178
01:33:45,880 --> 01:33:48,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the fishermen.</font>

1179
01:33:48,712 --> 01:33:50,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, they caught everybody.</font>

1180
01:33:55,788 --> 01:33:57,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doorways.</font>

1181
01:33:59,978 --> 01:34:04,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not one part of you
has changed, Robert.</font>

1182
01:34:07,386 --> 01:34:09,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">You talk too much.</font>

1183
01:34:11,467 --> 01:34:16,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then,
not at all</font>

1184
01:34:16,899 --> 01:34:18,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Elizabeth.</font>

1185
01:34:20,208 --> 01:34:25,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">I couldn't ask you
not to go to Geneva.</font>

1186
01:34:28,001 --> 01:34:29,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">I couldn't.</font>

1187
01:34:29,432 --> 01:34:33,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't want to ask you
to leave Cambridge.</font>

1188
01:34:38,657 --> 01:34:41,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was that how it happened?</font>

1189
01:34:42,756 --> 01:34:45,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't trust my memory anymore.</font>

1190
01:34:46,318 --> 01:34:48,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never forget anything.</font>

1191
01:34:48,680 --> 01:34:50,783

01:35:14,460 --> 01:35:16,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't look at me, bitch,
look away!</font>

1197
01:35:17,771 --> 01:35:19,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop it!</font>

1198
01:35:23,905 --> 01:35:26,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't look!</font>

are on their way to stop it.</font>

1207
01:37:07,627 --> 01:37:09,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to find it
before they do</font>

1208
01:37:09,158 --> 01:37:12,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">and trigger an explosion
to ensure it's released.</font>

we can contain it.</font>

1229
01:39:13,664 --> 01:39:15,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just drainage.
It goes to the city cistern.</font>

1230
01:39:15,899 --> 01:39:18,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're looking for a large,
underground space,</font>

exactly what he described.</font>

1239
01:39:44,028 --> 01:39:46,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do I use it?</font>

1240
01:39:46,699 --> 01:39:50,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a cap
in the padial integrate.</font>

1241
01:39:50,113 --> 01:39:53,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">The device also has a
detonation button.</font>

will trigger the explosion.</font>

1243
01:39:57,054 --> 01:39:58,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's enough
to break the bag?</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">The walls are cement all around.</font>

1245

1246
01:40:05,904 --> 01:40:08,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what break the bag.</font>

1247

<font color="#FFFFFF">History says that the Black Plague
caused misery and death.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">But, what they don't tell us,</font>

1249
01:40:20,313 --> 01:40:25,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">is that it also produced a leaner population,

<font color="#FFFFFF">Why is suffering later
preferable to suffering now?</font>

1253
01:40:33,346 --> 01:40:38,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if we embrace it.
And then maybe pain can save us.</font>

1254
01:40:39,581 --> 01:40:44,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're getting this, aren't you?
I can see that you are.</font>

1255
01:40:44,036 --> 01:40:47,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now I need to know
that I'm not alone.</font>

We've modernized.</font>

1263
01:41:22,679 --> 01:41:23,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">But there is water in there.</font>

1264
01:41:23,853 --> 01:41:26,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.
It eventually filters down into the earth.</font>

1265
01:41:26,095 --> 01:41:27,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">But why are all these people here?</font>

1266
01:41:27,460 --> 01:41:30,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is a tourist attraction.
The acoustics are excellent.</font>

1275
01:41:54,126 --> 01:41:55,786

1276
01:41:59,733 --> 01:42:02,454

01:42:28,689 --> 01:42:31,890

dozens.</font>

1282
01:42:33,394 --> 01:42:34,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's find it.</font>

1283
01:42:34,932 --> 01:42:37,804
