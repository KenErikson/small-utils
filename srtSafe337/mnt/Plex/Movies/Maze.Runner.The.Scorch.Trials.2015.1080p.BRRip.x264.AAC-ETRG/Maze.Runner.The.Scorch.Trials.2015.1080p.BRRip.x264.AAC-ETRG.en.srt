00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think it's safe to say the Maze Trails were a complete success.</font>

3
00:00:14,282 --> 00:00:16,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's too soon to say, but...</font>

4
00:00:16,123 --> 00:00:17,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">they could be the key to everything.</font>

5
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:21,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's time now to begin... Phase Two.</font>

6
00:00:23,256 --> 00:00:24,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome to The Scorch!</font>

7
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">The world outside is hanging on by a very thin thread.</font>

8
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Beyond this door...</font>

9
00:00:32,362 --> 00:00:34,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">lies the beginning of your new lives.</font>

10
00:00:35,936 --> 00:00:36,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey Thomas!</font>

11
00:00:36,735 --> 00:00:37,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">We weren't the only maze!</font>

12
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:41,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you remember about Wicked?</font>

13
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:43,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remember they sent me into the maze.</font>

14
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remember watching my friends die in front of me.</font>

15
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you want to understand?</font>

16
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:50,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">Understand what?</font>

17
00:00:50,042 --> 00:00:51,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why this all happened.</font>

18
00:00:52,268 --> 00:00:53,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just need to know...</font>

19
00:00:53,783 --> 00:00:55,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">whose side are you on?</font>

20
00:00:56,773 --> 00:00:58,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're hiding something.</font>

21
00:00:58,612 --> 00:00:59,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, you don't know that!</font>

22
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:01,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">They lied to us.</font>

23
00:01:01,932 --> 00:01:03,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">We never escaped.</font>

24
00:01:03,133 --> 00:01:04,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">This has all just been part of their plan.</font>

25
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:05,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do they want from us?</font>

26
00:01:08,507 --> 00:01:09,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thomas!</font>

27
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">The maze is one thing!</font>

28
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:13,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you kids won't last one day out in The Scorch!</font>

29
00:01:21,396 --> 00:01:22,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell -?</font>

30
00:01:25,329 --> 00:01:27,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">The course of your lives...</font>

31
00:01:27,168 --> 00:01:29,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">will determine the course of humanity.</font>

32
00:01:31,918 --> 00:01:32,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">Into light...</font>

33
00:01:33,088 --> 00:01:34,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">and darkness.</font>
