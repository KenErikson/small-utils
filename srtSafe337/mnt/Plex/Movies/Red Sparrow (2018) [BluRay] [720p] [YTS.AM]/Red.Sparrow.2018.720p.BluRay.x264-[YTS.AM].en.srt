Okay.</font>

00:03:21,158 --> 00:03:23,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Leni.
Hello, my beauty.</font>

26
00:03:57,194 --> 00:03:59,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tonight, you are
the pride of Russia.</font>

27
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:03,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">May I present my niece,
Dominika Egorova?</font>

28
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:06,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Dmitri Ustinov,

anything I can do for you,</font>

30

<font color="#FFFFFF">don't hesitate to ask.</font>

31
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:13,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">May we have a photo?</font>

32
00:04:13,502 --> 00:04:14,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

33
00:07:33,702 --> 00:07:34,737

00:07:40,709 --> 00:07:41,790

36
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:44,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">American!
Get on your knees!</font>

37
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ow!</font>

38
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:16,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you hear anything?</font>

39
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:19,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">As far as we know,
he got away clean.</font>

40
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'll be in your
apartment by now.</font>

41
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anything sensitive?</font>

42
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:24,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no.
Of course not.</font>

43
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:26,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, you'll fly to D.C.
in the morning.</font>

44
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">It'll be a stink,
but we'll get you out.</font>

45
00:08:28,507 --> 00:08:31,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doesn't look like anyone
was actually killed...</font>

46
00:08:31,218 --> 00:08:32,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">but Washington
has questions.</font>

47
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:35,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I gotta ask,
what the fuck were you thinking?</font>

48
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was protecting my asset.</font>

49
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:39,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">How'd that work out?
He got away, didn't he?</font>

50
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I guess you should
hear it from me.</font>

51
00:08:42,938 --> 00:08:44,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those guys in the park?</font>

52
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:46,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Word is they were vice cops,
looking for Chechen dealers...</font>

53
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:49,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">or some family guy getting
a blow job in the bushes.</font>

54
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:52,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">They weren't there for Marble.
They just got lucky.</font>

55
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chances are they would
have questioned you,</font>

56
00:08:54,491 --> 00:08:55,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">and let you go.</font>

57
00:08:58,495 --> 00:09:01,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you can bet your ass
they're looking for him now.</font>

58
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">They are expecting you,
Deputy Director.</font>

59
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

60
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:18,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Terrible news
about your niece.</font>

61
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:22,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">I trust she's recovering.</font>

62
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:25,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's in surgery now.</font>

63
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the prognosis
for her leg is not good.</font>

64
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry to hear that. Drink?</font>

65
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">That depends.
What's the occasion?</font>

66
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think
you'll want one.</font>

67
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:39,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">There was an incident
last night, at Gorky Park.</font>

68
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:44,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">Undercover narcotics agents
saw what they thought...</font>

69
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">was a drug deal in process.</font>

70
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:50,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">When they moved in
to question this man...</font>

71
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:53,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">the other man
fired his weapon.</font>

72
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">A clear attempt
at distraction.</font>

73
00:09:55,302 --> 00:09:58,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now we know
his name is Nate Nash.</font>

74
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:03,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">Officially, a commercial
counselor, but he's CIA.</font>

75
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:05,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">He left the country
this morning</font>

76
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">on a diplomatic
passport.</font>

77
00:10:06,855 --> 00:10:09,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">However,
the man he was meeting...</font>

78
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:11,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">doesn't panic, doesn't run.</font>

79
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:14,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">He simply walks away.</font>

80
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">My question is...</font>

81
00:10:18,408 --> 00:10:19,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">who is he?</font>

82
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:39,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your Uncle Vanya has come
to visit the invalids.</font>

83
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:43,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">You look well.</font>

84
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:45,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doctor said you wouldn't
be walking for months.</font>

85
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doctors don't know
everything.</font>

86
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, they don't.</font>

87
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:52,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll make some tea.</font>

88
00:11:52,836 --> 00:11:54,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me help.</font>

89
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm glad my brother
isn't here to see</font>

90
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">what that clumsy fool
did to you.</font>

91
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">It would have
broken his heart.</font>

92
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was an accident.</font>

93
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you smoking?</font>

94
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can smell it on you.</font>

95
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:18,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why not?</font>

96
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:22,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've heard they already
have a replacement</font>

97
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:24,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">for you at the company.</font>

98
00:12:24,284 --> 00:12:26,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">This girl named Sonya.</font>

99
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">Apparently
she's good.</font>

100
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:31,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not as good as you,
but with time she can learn.</font>

101
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:34,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you read
the reviews?</font>

102
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:36,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">Competitive as you are.</font>

103
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:38,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you come
to commiserate, Uncle?</font>

104
00:12:38,423 --> 00:12:39,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I've come to help.</font>

105
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me, this apartment,</font>

106
00:12:42,552 --> 00:12:44,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">it belongs
to the Bolshoi, right?</font>

107
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long do you think
they will let you stay here...</font>

108
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:49,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">now that you are no longer
part of the company?</font>

109
00:12:49,601 --> 00:12:52,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three months, six months?
If they are generous.</font>

110
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,308
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what about medical
coverage for your mother?</font>

111
00:12:54,481 --> 00:12:56,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">They pay that as well, right?
Yes.</font>

112
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does she know?</font>

113
00:12:58,403 --> 00:12:59,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's not stupid.</font>

114
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:00,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course not.</font>

115
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:02,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I know I haven't
been around as much</font>

116
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">since my brother died.</font>

117
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:07,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I'm here now.</font>

118
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I want to help you.</font>

119
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:14,160
<font color="#FFFFFF">So come see me
when you're ready. Please.</font>

120
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:16,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have something
for you.</font>

121
00:13:26,346 --> 00:13:28,053
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, Dominika...</font>

122
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">there are no accidents.</font>

123
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">We create our own fate.</font>

124
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,395
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Sonya?</i></font>

125
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:50,114
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Hey.</i></font>

126
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,115
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>How are you?</i></font>

127
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:53,654
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>What is it?</i></font>

128
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:57,245
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I'm scared.</i></font>

129
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:59,751
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I went to see her
at the hospital.</i></font>

130
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,129
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>The way she looked at me,
she knows.</i></font>

131
00:14:02,674 --> 00:14:04,086
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>She doesn't know.</i></font>

132
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,505
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>What we have done is a sin.</i></font>

133
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:09,879
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>They've always favored her.</i></font>

134
00:14:10,932 --> 00:14:13,515
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>No one else ever got a chance.
Is that fair?</i></font>

135
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,768
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Isn't that a sin?</i></font>

136
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:21,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good! I think
it's enough for tonight.</font>

137
00:14:21,693 --> 00:14:22,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get some rest.</font>

138
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">In three minutes.</font>

139
00:16:14,222 --> 00:16:16,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's been an accident
at the Bolshoi Theatre.</font>

140
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">Women's locker room.
Please hurry.</font>

141
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leni?</font>

142
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mama?</font>

143
00:16:37,078 --> 00:16:38,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mama?</font>

144
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? What happened?</font>

145
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:44,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one was here.</font>

146
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:46,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where was Leni?</font>

147
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:50,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Bolshoi said they
wouldn't pay her anymore.</font>

148
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:54,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to
take care of us.</font>

149
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:56,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna take care
of us now.</font>

150
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:10,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could have come
to my office.</font>

151
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:11,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's cold outside.</font>

152
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:13,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not yet.</font>

153
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:15,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">You broke her jaw.</font>

154
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">You always had a temper,

you could help us.</font>

156
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you help me.</font>

157
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what do you
want me to do?</font>

158
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">State security
is interested in</font>

Remember?</font>

161
00:17:36,846 --> 00:17:37,846

won't be able to resist.</font>

when your leg is better...</font>

165
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:45,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you
to get to know him.</font>

166
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">And get close to him.
And win his trust.</font>

167

I win his trust?</font>

to put on a show, Dominika.</font>

172
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you do this,
Dominika...</font>

173

212

no such thing as luck.</font>

213
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:12,325

is there?</font>

215
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me the real reason
you are here.</font>

216
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:32,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">I came to see you.</font>

217
00:20:32,897 --> 00:20:35,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what is it
you want from me?</font>

218
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:38,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">All I ever wanted
was to be a dancer.</font>

219
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:42,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ever since I was
a small child...</font>

220
00:20:42,615 --> 00:20:45,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">when I would take the bus
to rehearsal after school...</font>

221
00:20:46,369 --> 00:20:47,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I would look out
of the windows</font>

222
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">at the people
going about their lives...</font>

half-asleep...</font>

224
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:55,500

tell myself...</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">"I'm not like them...</font>

226
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:00,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">"and I never will be...</font>

227
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:02,633
<font color="#FFFFFF">"because I'm special."</font>

228
00:21:05,346 --> 00:21:07,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to be
special again.</font>

229
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:33,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a beautiful room.</font>

230
00:21:34,542 --> 00:21:36,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm surprised
you can afford it.</font>

231
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you excuse me,
for just a moment?</font>

232
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course.</font>

233
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:14,821
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can we be alone?</font>

234
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:30,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take off your dress.</font>

235
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:43,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take off your dress.</font>

236
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:09,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come here.</font>

237
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:16,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">May I?</font>

238
00:23:26,821 --> 00:23:28,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">A crack in the vase.</font>

239
00:23:29,365 --> 00:23:32,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">True value comes
in the smallest imperfection.</font>

240
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:37,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">A defining detail...</font>

241
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:43,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">that makes it worthy
of collection.</font>

242
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">Slow down.</font>

243
00:24:02,857 --> 00:24:04,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Slow down.</font>

244
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:07,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no! Slowly!</font>

245
00:24:08,154 --> 00:24:09,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">Slowly!</font>

246
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:25,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey! Hey, you!</font>

247
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did it happen?</font>

248
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ustinov dismissed
his security,</font>

249
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:42,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I saw an opportunity,
and I took it.</font>

250
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would he do that?</font>

251
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:47,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">She asked him to.</font>

252
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:52,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">She could be useful.</font>

253
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's a witness.</font>

254
00:26:54,445 --> 00:26:55,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get rid of her.</font>

255
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:57,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">I trust her discretion.</font>

256
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:02,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I were you,
I would be very sure.</font>

257
00:27:04,455 --> 00:27:05,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who is she?</font>

258
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:07,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">My niece.</font>

259
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:10,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">The dancer?</font>

260
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:13,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

261
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:20,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shame.</font>

262
00:27:39,907 --> 00:27:41,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">You knew what would happen,</font>

263
00:27:41,535 --> 00:27:43,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">once I got him in that room,
didn't you?</font>

264
00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:44,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wouldn't have gone</font>

265
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:46,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">if I had told you
what had to happen.</font>

266
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would have had a choice.</font>

267
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:48,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what I do.</font>

268
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:51,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">You came to me.
That was your choice.</font>

269
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are my uncle.</font>

270
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would never have
let him hurt you.</font>

271
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:59,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was inside me.</font>

272
00:28:02,388 --> 00:28:04,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to die.</font>

273
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:06,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have to.</font>

274
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:09,058
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's another life for you,
if you want it.</font>

275
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:11,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have potential,
great potential.</font>

276
00:28:12,773 --> 00:28:14,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, you did well
to get him alone.</font>

277
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">What you said in that bar
was exactly right...</font>

278
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:19,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">because you told him exactly
what he needed to hear.</font>

279
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:22,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is a program
that can teach you</font>

280
00:28:22,366 --> 00:28:23,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">everything you need to know.</font>

281
00:28:24,161 --> 00:28:26,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">The training is very hard.</font>

282
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:27,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only a few make it.</font>

283
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:30,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you know how to survive.
That's why I chose you.</font>

284
00:28:32,251 --> 00:28:33,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unless if I'm wrong.</font>

285
00:28:34,378 --> 00:28:36,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps you don't like
my line of work.</font>

286
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:37,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps you disapprove.</font>

287
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">In that case...</font>

288
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:43,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">your future
will be out of my hands.</font>

289
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:46,759

291
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:02,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it?</font>

292
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:09,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to go away
for a while.</font>

293
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:11,413

your uncle has arranged.</i></font>

295
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:18,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll be able
to take care of us now.</font>

296
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:21,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have to do this.</font>

297
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:22,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's too late
for that now.</font>

298
00:29:23,135 --> 00:29:25,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no.
What have you done?</font>

299
00:29:26,013 --> 00:29:27,174
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I'm sorry.</i></font>

300
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:30,470
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Now,
I warned you about him.</i></font>

301
00:29:31,185 --> 00:29:33,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">The way he looked at you
as a child.</font>

302
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:35,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mama.</font>

303
00:29:35,481 --> 00:29:37,644

to keep him away.</i></font>

304
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:41,189
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I tried to protect you.</i></font>

305
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:43,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">You hold
something back, hmm?</font>

306
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't give him all of you.</font>

307
00:29:48,619 --> 00:29:50,109
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>That is how you survive.</i></font>

308
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:51,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, Mama.</font>

309
00:29:59,256 --> 00:30:01,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome to
State School Four.</font>

310
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:03,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will know me as Matron.</font>

311
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:05,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">Inside, you will find
the name</font>

312
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:06,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">you will use
during your training.</font>

313
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:09,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">Under no circumstances will
you reveal your true name...</font>

314
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:11,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">or any other
personal information,</font>

315
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:13,843
<font color="#FFFFFF">to a cadet
or member of staff.</font>

316
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that understood?
Yes.</font>

317
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good. I'll show you
to your room.</font>

318
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:27,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not like
our usual recruits.</font>

319
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:29,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">Most of them
come from the military</font>

320
00:30:29,952 --> 00:30:31,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">with some
training already.</font>

321
00:30:32,122 --> 00:30:34,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll have to work hard
to catch up.</font>

322
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:36,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will do
what is asked of me.</font>

323
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure you will.</font>

324
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:40,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">But someone like you does
not end up here by choice.</font>

325
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:44,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">A prima ballerina
with a uncle in the SVR.</font>

326
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:46,834
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is your crime?</font>

327
00:30:48,387 --> 00:30:50,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I suppose
it doesn't matter.</font>

328
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you cannot be
of service to the state,</font>

329
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am to put a bullet
through your head.</font>

330
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:00,268
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>The Cold War did not end.</i></font>

331
00:31:00,442 --> 00:31:03,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">It shattered into
a thousand dangerous pieces.</font>

332
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:05,986
<font color="#FFFFFF">The West has grown weak.</font>

333
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:08,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drunk on shopping
and social media.</font>

334
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:12,696
<font color="#FFFFFF">Torn apart by hatred
between the races.</font>

335
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:16,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">And as a result,
the world is in chaos.</font>

336
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only Russia is willing
to make the sacrifices</font>

337
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:21,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">required for victory.</font>

338
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:22,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">For there to be peace...</font>

339
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:25,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">we must once again
place ourselves</font>

340
00:31:25,424 --> 00:31:26,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">at the head of nations.</font>

341
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:29,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">From this day forward,
you will become Sparrows.</font>

342
00:31:30,262 --> 00:31:33,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Weapons in a global
struggle for power.</font>

343
00:31:34,308 --> 00:31:36,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have been selected
because of your beauty.</font>

344
00:31:37,938 --> 00:31:39,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because of your strength.</font>

345
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:43,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">And in some cases because
of your vulnerability.</font>

346
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:50,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">Katya, Viktor,
come here, please.</font>

347
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:59,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here, we deal in
psychological manipulation.</font>

348
00:32:00,042 --> 00:32:03,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll be trained to determine
a target's weakness...</font>

349
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:06,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">to exploit that weakness
through seduction...</font>

350
00:32:07,299 --> 00:32:09,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">and to extract information.</font>

351
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:12,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take off your clothes.</font>

352
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:20,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your body
belongs to the state.</font>

353
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:22,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">Since your birth,
the state nourished it.</font>

354
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:24,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now the state asks
something in return.</font>

355
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:34,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must learn to sacrifice
for a higher purpose.</font>

356
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:37,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">To push yourself
beyond all limitation...</font>

357
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">and forget
the sentimental morality</font>

358
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:40,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">with which you were raised.</font>

359
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or is it pride?</font>

360
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">In my experience,</font>

361
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:48,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">the proud
are the first to fall.</font>

362
00:32:53,387 --> 00:32:55,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">Viktor, put on your clothes.</font>

363
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:08,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're ready for you.</font>

364
00:33:09,653 --> 00:33:11,691
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is the recommendation
of this panel...</font>

365
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:13,946
<font color="#FFFFFF">that you be
suspended indefinitely</font>

366
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:15,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">from foreign assignment.</font>

367
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:17,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll be staying here
in the States, Nate.</font>

368
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:20,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">So who's gonna
handle Marble?</font>

369
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:21,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's no longer
your concern.</font>

370
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:23,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Simon...</font>

371
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:28,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been with this guy
for three years.</font>

372
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:32,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">He is not going to
deal with anybody...</font>

373
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:35,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">that he doesn't know,
and doesn't trust.</font>

374
00:33:36,306 --> 00:33:40,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like I said.
That is no longer your concern.</font>

375
00:33:59,663 --> 00:34:00,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">Metka.</font>

376
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:05,490

tailored to each subject.</font>

377
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,998

after intimate contact...</font>

378
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:12,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">the subject will be traceable
for up to six weeks.</font>

379
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:23,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every human being
is a puzzle of need.</font>

380
00:34:23,769 --> 00:34:25,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must learn
to intuit what is missing.</font>

381
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">Become the missing piece...</font>

382
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:29,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">and they will
give you anything.</font>

383
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:34,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">This man is a diplomat
at the Dutch Embassy</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">with access to
NATO military planning.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Six years ago,
his marriage ended...</font>

386
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">when the police were
called to his apartment</font>

387

<font color="#FFFFFF">for a domestic
disturbance.</font>

388
00:34:42,454 --> 00:34:44,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">His wife accused him</font>

389
00:34:44,456 --> 00:34:46,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">of inappropriately
touching their daughter.</font>

390
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:49,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">Several nights a week,
he hires girls.</font>

391
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:52,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Runaways. Addicts.</font>

392
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">What does he want?</font>

393
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wants
something rough.</font>

394
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:59,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">He goes to runaways because
they cannot call the police.</font>

395
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:01,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.
You disagree?</font>

396
00:35:01,181 --> 00:35:02,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wants a daughter...</font>

397
00:35:02,516 --> 00:35:06,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">someone to take care of,
and he'll pay for it.</font>

398
00:35:08,063 --> 00:35:09,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very good, Katya.</font>

399
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:11,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">He never touches
the girls.</font>

400
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:13,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">He buys them dinner.</font>

401
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Next...</font>

402
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:20,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">This man represented
Chuvashia in Parliament.</font>

403
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:22,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was a leading critic
of the president,</font>

404
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:25,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">until he was arrested
for indecency.</font>

405
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:29,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did he want?</font>

406
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">He looks like a degenerate.</font>

407
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">By a degenerate,
you mean a homosexual?</font>

408
00:35:35,132 --> 00:35:36,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes.
- Correct.</font>

409
00:35:36,675 --> 00:35:39,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">Though, we mustn't
be so judgmental.</font>

410
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:42,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">We all have our passions.
His happen to be rather young.</font>

411
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:47,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anya, come here
for a moment.</font>

412
00:36:05,704 --> 00:36:07,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here he is.</font>

413
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:09,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give him what he wants.</font>

414
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you mean?</font>

415
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">You called him
a degenerate?</font>

416
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:17,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Therefore, he doesn't want
what's between your legs.</font>

417
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, be a boy.</font>

418
00:36:20,969 --> 00:36:22,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">On your knees.</font>

419
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:30,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not the first time,
I'm sure.</font>

420
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:33,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Must have been some boy
in a field behind your house.</font>

421
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:35,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">A girl in a rainy bus stop?</font>

422
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:37,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'd like to think
it makes a difference.</font>

423
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it doesn't.</font>

424
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:40,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just flesh.</font>

425
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:45,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't!</font>

426
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:46,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, you can.</font>

427
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tomorrow,
you'll try again.</font>

428
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">And again
the day after that.</font>

429
00:36:57,923 --> 00:37:00,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must inure yourself
to what you find repellant.</font>

430
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">Find beauty
in the human delusion...</font>

431
00:37:05,472 --> 00:37:06,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">that the pleasures
of the flesh</font>

432
00:37:07,057 --> 00:37:09,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">will make us whole again.</font>

433
00:37:11,353 --> 00:37:13,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even when
the subject is repellant,</font>

434
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:15,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">the body can be tricked.</font>

435
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:28,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">A graze of the fingers
to the thigh...</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Manipulation
of the nipple...</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">sexual desire.</font>

441
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:52,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">But physical manipulation
is not enough.</font>

442
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:55,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must learn
to love on command.</font>

443
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it to be loved?</font>

444
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:03,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">To be seen.</font>

445
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:05,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">To be recognized.</font>

446
00:38:07,744 --> 00:38:08,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">To feel no longer alone.</font>

447
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:27,614

00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:46,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what do you
make of that?</font>

458
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:48,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">If the Russians
are still following me,</font>

459
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:49,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">it means they're
looking for him.</font>

460
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:51,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">It means that Marble's still
out there. He's still alive.</font>

461
00:38:51,411 --> 00:38:53,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">As far as we know.</font>

462
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:54,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not talking to him.</font>

463
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:57,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">Marble's refused all
attempts at communication...</font>

464
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:58,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">over the last
four and a half months.</font>

465
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">He will come out for me.</font>

466
00:39:02,297 --> 00:39:04,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you can't get me into Russia,
but somewhere close.</font>

467
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:06,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somewhere in
Eastern Europe.</font>

468
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:08,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">And SVR will be
on me right away.</font>

469
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:12,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">Marble will get word.
He's gonna surface.</font>

470
00:39:12,724 --> 00:39:14,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">Otherwise, I guarantee you,
he's just gonna stay silent.</font>

471
00:39:14,601 --> 00:39:16,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Simon, you gotta
send me back.</font>

472
00:39:16,813 --> 00:39:17,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

473
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:19,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you got one assignment.</font>

474
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">You make contact,</font>

475
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:24,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you convince him to
work with another officer.</font>

476
00:39:25,445 --> 00:39:27,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">That'd be me. We'll
be coming with you.</font>

477
00:39:27,614 --> 00:39:29,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you have
a problem with that?</font>

478
00:39:29,449 --> 00:39:30,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No problem.</font>

479
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:41,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">These soldiers
have been deployed overseas</font>

480
00:39:41,753 --> 00:39:43,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">for almost a year.</font>

481
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:48,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome them home.</font>

482
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:10,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">Turn out the lights.
No rush.</font>

483
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:12,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's your name?</font>

484
00:40:12,869 --> 00:40:13,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pyotr.</font>

485
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:38,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have someone at home?</font>

486
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:40,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone you think about?</font>

487
00:40:43,273 --> 00:40:44,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">Close your eyes.</font>

488
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:53,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">Think of her face.</font>

489
00:40:53,992 --> 00:40:56,985
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Remember her smell,
her touch...</i></font>

490
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:58,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">What can we say
about this?</font>

491
00:40:59,164 --> 00:41:02,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sweet, sentimental,
maintaining control.</font>

492
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you chose
a boy, Katya.</font>

493
00:41:05,128 --> 00:41:06,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you chose a boy</font>

494
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:08,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">so you would
not have to give yourself.</font>

495
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">Won't always be that easy.</font>

496
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:12,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">Next!</font>

497
00:41:41,873 --> 00:41:45,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three days ago,
Nash was reassigned to Budapest.</font>

498
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe it is an attempt</font>

499
00:41:46,878 --> 00:41:48,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">to re-establish
contact with the mole.</font>

500
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have
friends in Budapest.</font>

501
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:51,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have them pick him up,</font>

502
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:54,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">and extract
the information directly.</font>

503
00:41:54,721 --> 00:41:56,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">That means we have to
explain to President...</font>

504
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:58,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">why every officer
we have in Western Europe</font>

505
00:41:58,432 --> 00:41:59,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">is snatched
in retaliation.</font>

506
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:01,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Vanya's correct.</font>

507
00:42:01,768 --> 00:42:03,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">The president will
not condone anything</font>

508
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:06,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">that antagonizes
the Americans unnecessarily.</font>

509
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not yet.</font>

510
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:12,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you
propose, Ivan?</font>

511
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:14,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nash is
a skilled officer.</font>

512
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:18,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">That night, in the park,
he made a mistake.</font>

513
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:20,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">He reacted emotionally...</font>

514
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:23,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">which tells me
he cares about the man.</font>

515
00:42:25,418 --> 00:42:28,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">I propose we give him
someone else to care about.</font>

516
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:51,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're accused of
assaulting a fellow cadet.</font>

517
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:53,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">He tried to rape me.</font>

518
00:42:53,278 --> 00:42:55,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">And your honor
is worth depriving Russia</font>

519
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:56,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">of a promising cadet.</font>

520
00:42:56,907 --> 00:43:01,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was never my intention
to deprive Russia of anything.</font>

521
00:43:01,536 --> 00:43:02,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">And yet here we are.</font>

522
00:43:03,873 --> 00:43:05,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Matron, what is
your opinion?</font>

523
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:07,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's only
been three months...</font>

524
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:10,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I believe
Katya still has potential.</font>

525
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would like a moment alone
with the accused.</font>

526
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:26,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">You did well
with Ustinov in Moscow.</font>

527
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:29,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is why you were
given this chance.</font>

528
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:31,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were told
what would happen to you,</font>

529
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:32,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you fail here?</font>

530
00:43:32,485 --> 00:43:34,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. So why not
let him have you?</font>

531
00:43:35,028 --> 00:43:36,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">I serve the state.</font>

532
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:38,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">I serve our president.</font>

533
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:44,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">I serve you, General.
But I owe him nothing.</font>

534
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:47,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">What sort of man
would send his niece</font>

535
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:48,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">to State School Four?</font>

536
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:50,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">A patriot.</font>

537
00:43:54,257 --> 00:43:56,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">My wife and I saw you
dance once.</font>

538
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:58,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was a different life.</font>

539
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:02,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are so many.
Don't you find?</font>

540
00:44:06,686 --> 00:44:07,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">You may go.</font>

541
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:20,483
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Sparrows must
harden themselves</i></font>

542
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:22,235
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>against the weak
and sentimental...</i></font>

543
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:25,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">and see these things
for what they are.</font>

544
00:44:25,288 --> 00:44:26,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">Selfishness.</font>

545
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:32,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me, Katya...</font>

546
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:33,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">what does he want?</font>

547
00:44:35,088 --> 00:44:36,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come forward.</font>

548
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:47,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">For the deception
to be complete,</font>

549
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:48,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">you must
hold nothing back.</font>

550
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:51,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing. Understand?</font>

551
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:57,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give him what he wants.</font>

552
00:45:06,579 --> 00:45:07,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well?</font>

553
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:10,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">Turn around.</font>

554
00:45:10,373 --> 00:45:12,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">I said, turn around!
No.</font>

555
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:21,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't look at her.</font>

556
00:45:24,931 --> 00:45:26,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to watch you do it.</font>

557
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:29,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at me!</font>

558
00:45:33,271 --> 00:45:34,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at me.</font>

559
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:39,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">I said look at me!</font>

560
00:45:56,753 --> 00:45:57,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well?</font>

561
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:06,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you waiting for?</font>

562
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:11,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm ready.</font>

563
00:46:11,726 --> 00:46:13,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you going
to fuck me or not?</font>

564
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:22,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing?</font>

565
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:28,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shame.</font>

566
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:30,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bitch.</font>

567
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:35,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">Power.</font>

568
00:46:36,918 --> 00:46:38,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what he wants.</font>

569
00:46:39,297 --> 00:46:40,331
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Get dressed.</i></font>

570
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:55,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is a car waiting
to take you to Moscow.</font>

571
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:58,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have done everything
you've asked of me.</font>

572
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:00,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">On the contrary.</font>

573
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:03,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have done
nothing I asked.</font>

574
00:47:03,903 --> 00:47:05,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">But my superiors
think otherwise.</font>

575
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:12,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">I suppose we'll find out.</font>

576
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:19,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goodbye...</font>

577
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:22,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dominika.</font>

578
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:32,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Mama.</font>

579
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:40,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's you.</font>

580
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:42,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm home.</font>

581
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:44,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">My baby...</font>

582
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:58,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello?</font>

583
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:04,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

584
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:11,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll never let you go.</font>

585
00:48:12,764 --> 00:48:14,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll find away.</font>

586
00:48:26,945 --> 00:48:30,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome home.
How are you?</font>

587
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:32,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have a seat.</font>

588
00:48:34,911 --> 00:48:36,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">What can I get you?
I'm not hungry.</font>

589
00:48:37,081 --> 00:48:38,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, come on.</font>

590
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:40,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">You used to love this place
when you were little.</font>

591
00:48:40,668 --> 00:48:43,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were always so serious
with your big, grown-up eyes</font>

592
00:48:43,628 --> 00:48:44,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">in your child's face.</font>

593
00:48:44,963 --> 00:48:46,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you want,
Uncle?</font>

594
00:48:48,134 --> 00:48:50,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is a traitor highly
placed in the government.</font>

595
00:48:50,552 --> 00:48:53,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Probably in one of
the intelligence agencies.</font>

596
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:54,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">A mole.</font>

597
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:58,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">His last known
contact...</font>

598
00:48:59,894 --> 00:49:01,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">is an American
now in Budapest.</font>

599
00:49:02,106 --> 00:49:04,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">What I want from you
is to get close to him.</font>

600
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:06,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">And establish trust.</font>

601
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:08,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then you bring me
the name of the mole.</font>

602
00:49:09,195 --> 00:49:10,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">You follow the trail
wherever it leads you...</font>

603
00:49:10,947 --> 00:49:13,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">you sacrifice whatever
needs to be sacrificed.</font>

604
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:14,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">You understand?</font>

605
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, Uncle.</font>

606
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:19,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is for you.</font>

607
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it?</font>

608
00:49:22,126 --> 00:49:24,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">New passport.
Credentials.</font>

609
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:28,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">New name.
Katerina Zubkova.</font>

610
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:32,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what reward
will they give you?</font>

611
00:49:33,012 --> 00:49:34,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">A promotion?</font>

612
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:37,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">I understand
you are angry with me.</font>

613
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:39,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">You sent me
to whore school.</font>

614
00:49:40,059 --> 00:49:41,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">I made you special again.</font>

615
00:49:41,978 --> 00:49:44,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have a gift.
Like me.</font>

616
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:45,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see through people.</font>

617
00:49:45,858 --> 00:49:47,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see them
for what they really are.</font>

618
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:49,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you always stay
one step ahead.</font>

619
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:51,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">You do this for me,</font>

620
00:49:51,112 --> 00:49:52,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'll let you go
if that's what you want.</font>

621
00:49:53,072 --> 00:49:55,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I feel you won't.</font>

622
00:49:56,242 --> 00:49:58,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is what
you were meant to do.</font>

623
00:49:58,746 --> 00:50:00,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, Uncle.</font>

624
00:50:01,831 --> 00:50:03,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's eat.</font>

625
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:04,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me.</font>

626
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:08,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We'll have two of everything.
- Yes, sir.</font>

627
00:50:08,463 --> 00:50:09,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">How does that sound?</font>

628
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:36,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome to Budapest.</font>

629
00:51:00,682 --> 00:51:01,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must be Katerina.</font>

630
00:51:01,976 --> 00:51:02,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello.</font>

631
00:51:03,893 --> 00:51:05,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're pretty.</font>

632
00:51:10,858 --> 00:51:14,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll show you to your room.
Bathroom is down the hall.</font>

633
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:18,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm in there.
And you're through here.</font>

634
00:51:23,746 --> 00:51:25,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">I keep my door locked.</font>

635
00:51:25,123 --> 00:51:26,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I were you,
I'd do the same.</font>

636
00:51:27,083 --> 00:51:28,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay out of my way,
and I stay out of yours,</font>

637
00:51:29,085 --> 00:51:30,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we should
get along fine.</font>

638
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:32,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that clear?
Yes.</font>

639
00:51:33,047 --> 00:51:36,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">I imagine tomorrow you'll
meet our station chief.</font>

640
00:51:37,927 --> 00:51:39,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">A warning.</font>

641
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:40,961
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Chief Volontov
never met an idea</i></font>

642
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:42,420
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>he didn't want
to take credit for.</i></font>

643
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:45,387
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And he likes to try it on
with the new girls...</i></font>

644
00:51:45,561 --> 00:51:47,802
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>when he's not
drooling after strippers.</i></font>

645
00:51:48,563 --> 00:51:49,644
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>He's going to like you.</i></font>

646
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:51,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me about the American.</font>

647
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:53,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not exactly
match-fit.</font>

648
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:56,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">He swims
every afternoon.</font>

649
00:51:56,237 --> 00:51:59,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">Logs his time.
But he drinks too much.</font>

650
00:52:01,869 --> 00:52:04,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">He looks
at pornography.</font>

651
00:52:05,079 --> 00:52:06,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing out of
the ordinary.</font>

652
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:11,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anal. Threesomes.</font>

653
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:13,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Usually two men on a girl.</font>

654
00:52:16,090 --> 00:52:18,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">No relationships
to speak of.</font>

655
00:52:18,177 --> 00:52:20,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">A few girls he's paid,
couple of times...</font>

656
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:22,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">but then he feels guilty
and over-tips.</font>

657
00:52:23,556 --> 00:52:26,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps we'd have
more success</font>

658
00:52:26,184 --> 00:52:28,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">if we knew
what we were looking for.</font>

659
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:31,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm offering the complete
cooperation of my office.</font>

660
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:34,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">And in exchange,
I hope that you will...</font>

661
00:52:35,568 --> 00:52:38,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">keep us informed
of your progress.</font>

662
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:39,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course.</font>

663
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:20,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">Need a hand?</font>

664
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:21,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it's all right.</font>

665
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:23,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">Want it to be good?</font>

666
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:25,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me help you.</font>

667
00:53:25,827 --> 00:53:27,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, give it to me.</font>

668
00:53:31,666 --> 00:53:34,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every human being
is a puzzle of need.</font>

669
00:53:37,088 --> 00:53:39,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">Learn how to be
the missing piece,</font>

670
00:53:39,298 --> 00:53:41,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">and they will
give you everything.</font>

671
00:53:44,929 --> 00:53:47,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">You thought
you were the only one?</font>

672
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:53,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll always be their whores.</font>

673
00:53:58,527 --> 00:54:02,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unless, of course,
we have something they want.</font>

674
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:14,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I were you,
I'd find something.</font>

675
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:18,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">The pool is open
from 6:00 in the morning...</font>

676
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:20,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">until 10:00 at night
from Monday through Friday.</font>

677
00:54:21,382 --> 00:54:22,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">From 6:00 to 8:00
on weekends.</font>

678
00:54:24,802 --> 00:54:27,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">No personal belongings
are allowed on the pool deck.</font>

679
00:54:30,266 --> 00:54:32,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">I made a mistake.
Sorry.</font>

680
00:54:33,311 --> 00:54:36,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hand in your membership
card here for a locker key.</font>

681
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:38,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">You get your card back
when you return the key.</font>

682
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:40,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any questions?</font>

683
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:42,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

684
00:55:33,329 --> 00:55:34,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did you know
I was Russian?</font>

685
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:36,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was just a guess.</font>

686
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:39,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">You speak well.</font>

687
00:55:39,795 --> 00:55:41,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">I used to live
in Moscow.</font>

688
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:43,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you miss it?</font>

689
00:55:43,297 --> 00:55:44,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, food, people.</font>

690
00:55:44,967 --> 00:55:46,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what do you do
in Budapest?</font>

691
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:49,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a translator
at the Embassy. You?</font>

692
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:51,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">Commercial counselor.
Medical supplies.</font>

693
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:53,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never seen you at any
of the Embassy events.</font>

694
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:56,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">I haven't been here long.</font>

695
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:57,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me.</font>

696
00:56:06,028 --> 00:56:07,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blonde suits you,
by the way.</font>

697
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:10,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have we met?</font>

698
00:56:10,324 --> 00:56:12,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought I saw you
in the pool yesterday,</font>

699
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:14,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">and on the tram,
I think.</font>

700
00:56:14,496 --> 00:56:16,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're mistaken.</font>

701
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:20,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you like to get
something to eat with me?</font>

702
00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:22,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know a Turkish place
at the station.</font>

703
00:56:22,588 --> 00:56:24,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a shithole,
but the food's pretty good.</font>

704
00:56:25,257 --> 00:56:26,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe you know it.</font>

705
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:28,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not hungry.</font>

706
00:56:28,594 --> 00:56:30,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps another time?</font>

707
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:38,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll see you
at the pool, I guess.</font>

708
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:14,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your ID is missing.</font>

709
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:17,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you sure?</font>

710
00:57:17,643 --> 00:57:19,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. I put it
there myself.</font>

711
00:57:20,186 --> 00:57:23,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, I'll have to
make you a new one.</font>

712
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:25,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've got your picture
on file.</font>

713
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take your time.</font>

714
00:57:26,652 --> 00:57:31,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">She came in under
the name Katerina Zubkova.</font>

715
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:34,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">Registered as a translator
for the Embassy.</font>

716
00:57:34,742 --> 00:57:38,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">But her real name
is Dominika Egorova.</font>

717
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:42,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">She used to dance
with the Bolshoi.</font>

718
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:44,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's officially no record
of her being SVR...</font>

719
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:47,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">but that's bullshit.
She's here for Marble. I know it.</font>

720
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:49,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay away from her.
I think she's valuable.</font>

721
00:57:49,423 --> 00:57:50,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now you think
she's recruitable?</font>

722
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:51,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe.</font>

723
00:57:51,635 --> 00:57:53,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, that's not
what you're here for.</font>

724
00:57:53,302 --> 00:57:54,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just keep doing
what you're doing.</font>

725
00:57:54,972 --> 00:57:56,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">Play dead.</font>

726
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:57,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put the ticks to sleep</font>

727
00:57:57,431 --> 00:57:58,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">and pray Marble
sticks his head out again...</font>

728
00:57:58,684 --> 00:58:00,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">so we can get him back into play.
That's the priority.</font>

729
00:58:00,936 --> 00:58:03,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's Ivan Egorov's niece.</font>

730
00:58:07,985 --> 00:58:09,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Deputy director of the SVR?</font>

731
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:11,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have nieces.</font>

732
00:58:11,697 --> 00:58:12,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">Spend most of their time</font>

733
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:14,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">exposing themselves
on the Internet.</font>

734
00:58:14,365 --> 00:58:16,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would she use
her real name?</font>

735
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:17,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because
she's an innocent.</font>

736
00:58:17,661 --> 00:58:20,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or because
it's a provocation.</font>

737
00:58:20,204 --> 00:58:22,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">Both of which are very good
reasons to stay away from her.</font>

738
00:58:22,164 --> 00:58:23,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think there's
something about this girl.</font>

739
00:58:24,001 --> 00:58:26,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's gold. I know it.</font>

740
00:58:27,378 --> 00:58:30,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. See what
you can find out.</font>

741
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:32,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks.
Just go slow, all right?</font>

742
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:34,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

743
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:35,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nate?
Mmm-hmm?</font>

744
00:58:35,262 --> 00:58:38,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">If she does let you fuck her,
she's definitely SVR...</font>

745
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:41,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">because she's
way out of your league.</font>

746
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:48,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need you
to get me on the list</font>

747
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:49,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">for an event
at the American Embassy.</font>

748
00:58:50,027 --> 00:58:51,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could do that.</font>

749
00:58:51,402 --> 00:58:53,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.
If...</font>

750
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:56,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">you give me
a progress report in return.</font>

751
00:58:56,574 --> 00:58:58,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've established contact.</font>

752
00:58:58,201 --> 00:58:59,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Contact?</font>

753
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:01,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you'd be
on your back by now.</font>

754
00:59:02,706 --> 00:59:03,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know...</font>

755
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:06,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">there were always stories
about Sparrows.</font>

756
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:11,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Capable of performing
tricks on a man's mind.</font>

757
00:59:12,007 --> 00:59:13,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not to mention,
the rest of him.</font>

758
00:59:15,844 --> 00:59:17,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">A magic pussy.</font>

759
00:59:17,762 --> 00:59:19,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what they say.</font>

760
00:59:20,264 --> 00:59:21,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps I will find out.</font>

761

01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:33,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">You told me.</font>

780
01:00:34,713 --> 01:00:36,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">You stole my ID
from the pool.</font>

781
01:00:37,592 --> 01:00:39,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">That would be illegal.</font>

782
01:00:40,804 --> 01:00:41,923

796
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:08,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, how does it
make you feel?</font>

797
01:01:08,664 --> 01:01:10,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">What does it matter?</font>

798
01:01:11,293 --> 01:01:12,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">My mother is unwell.</font>

01:01:33,315 --> 01:01:34,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

809

817
01:01:52,541 --> 01:01:53,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that what you want?</font>

818
01:01:54,668 --> 01:01:56,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't have any.</font>

819
01:01:56,295 --> 01:01:58,583

825
01:04:33,452 --> 01:04:34,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was him at the Embassy.</font>

826
01:04:34,788 --> 01:04:35,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was.</font>

827
01:04:36,164 --> 01:04:37,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Playing hard to get,
are you?</font>

828
01:04:38,333 --> 01:04:40,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">No substitute

831
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:49,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's this?</font>

832
01:04:49,219 --> 01:04:50,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">A copy of the report</font>

833
01:04:50,427 --> 01:04:52,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">Volontov sent to Moscow
three days ago.</font>

834
01:04:52,262 --> 01:04:53,798

835
01:05:11,282 --> 01:05:12,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">Evening.</font>

836
01:05:12,492 --> 01:05:13,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good evening, sir.</font>

837
01:05:37,559 --> 01:05:39,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a coincidence?</font>

838
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:42,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were right.
I do need a friend.</font>

839
01:05:44,648 --> 01:05:46,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone needs a friend.</font>

840
01:05:48,735 --> 01:05:50,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need you to
send a report...</font>

843
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:56,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need more time.</font>

844
01:05:56,911 --> 01:05:58,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I would owe you.</font>

845
01:06:01,081 --> 01:06:03,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do I know
you pay your debts?</font>

846
01:06:13,135 --> 01:06:15,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were right
about Sparrows.</font>

847
01:06:15,554 --> 01:06:17,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are special.</font>

848

lever saw you.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Get your hands off me.</font>

854
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:41,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at the camera
over my left shoulder.</font>

855
01:06:41,748 --> 01:06:44,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tomorrow you will write
a favorable report,</font>

856
01:06:44,125 --> 01:06:46,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">or I'll have you
arrested for assault.</font>

Can I have a drink?</font>

869
01:08:28,145 --> 01:08:29,386

870
01:08:32,024 --> 01:08:33,024

<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

872
01:08:43,911 --> 01:08:45,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">So do you wanna tell me
what happened?</font>

873
01:08:47,873 --> 01:08:49,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">My pig boss is insulted</font>

874
01:08:49,333 --> 01:08:50,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want
to sleep with him.</font>

875
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's his name?</font>

876
01:08:53,921 --> 01:08:55,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maxim Volontov.</font>

877
01:08:55,756 --> 01:08:56,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've heard of him.</font>

878
01:09:00,302 --> 01:09:01,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did you know
where I live?</font>

879
01:09:19,404 --> 01:09:21,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why did you leave Russia?</font>

880
01:09:22,283 --> 01:09:23,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">I screwed up at work.</font>

881
01:09:25,953 --> 01:09:29,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would a CIA officer fire
his gun in a public park?</font>

882
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:33,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did it for a friend.</font>

883
01:09:34,087 --> 01:09:38,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I knew what they would do to him.
So do you.</font>

884
01:09:55,608 --> 01:09:57,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you want,
Dominika?</font>

885
01:10:02,657 --> 01:10:05,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you should probably
go home and figure it out.</font>

886
01:10:14,502 --> 01:10:15,832

887

891
01:12:14,831 --> 01:12:16,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you prefer a drink?</font>

892
01:12:16,666 --> 01:12:17,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure. But I don't
have much time.</font>

893
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:20,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't know you were coming.
What's the occasion?</font>

894
01:12:20,877 --> 01:12:22,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do I need one?</font>

895
01:12:22,963 --> 01:12:24,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm on my way to Vienna
for a meeting...</font>

896
01:12:24,798 --> 01:12:27,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I thought
I'd look in on you.</font>

897
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:28,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened to your eye?</font>

898
01:12:28,761 --> 01:12:30,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">I bumped it at the pool.</font>

899
01:12:30,595 --> 01:12:33,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have any news about
our American friend?</font>

900
01:12:33,724 --> 01:12:36,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's begun to lower
his guard around me.</font>

901
01:12:36,935 --> 01:12:39,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">He told me about
what happened at the park</font>

902
01:12:39,604 --> 01:12:41,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">after I established trust.</font>

903
01:12:41,481 --> 01:12:42,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

904
01:12:49,114 --> 01:12:51,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">So how was he?
Unmemorable.</font>

905
01:12:51,783 --> 01:12:52,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">But he's handsome, right?</font>

906
01:12:53,077 --> 01:12:54,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is he?</font>

907
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:01,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is there anything
out of the ordinary</font>

908
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:02,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">that you would
like to report?</font>

909
01:13:02,878 --> 01:13:05,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you lose contact...</font>

910
01:13:05,463 --> 01:13:07,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">or if he goes missing
for a day or more...</font>

911
01:13:07,716 --> 01:13:08,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">you need to let me know,</font>

912
01:13:08,926 --> 01:13:11,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">because our superiors
are getting impatient.</font>

913
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:12,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have something for you.</font>

914
01:13:15,432 --> 01:13:16,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something new.</font>

915
01:13:17,435 --> 01:13:19,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">A case
with great potential.</font>

916
01:13:19,436 --> 01:13:22,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought I made it very clear
you only have one mission.</font>

917
01:13:22,648 --> 01:13:25,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">A Russian agent inside
the American government...</font>

918
01:13:25,275 --> 01:13:27,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">is always of value,
is it not?</font>

919
01:13:27,485 --> 01:13:30,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">Marta and I are developing
the asset together.</font>

920
01:13:30,780 --> 01:13:32,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">A senator's
chief of staff.</font>

921
01:13:32,533 --> 01:13:34,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">And she is willing
to cooperate?</font>

922
01:13:34,368 --> 01:13:36,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's compromised.
She has no choice.</font>

923
01:13:36,287 --> 01:13:38,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">When do you see her again?
In London.</font>

924
01:13:38,288 --> 01:13:41,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">In a week's time.
But we need more money.</font>

925
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:42,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blackmail will
not be enough</font>

926
01:13:42,710 --> 01:13:44,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">to establish
long-term exchange.</font>

927
01:13:44,462 --> 01:13:45,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did you have in mind?</font>

928
01:13:45,837 --> 01:13:47,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">$250,000.</font>

929
01:13:51,301 --> 01:13:52,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is a lot of money.</font>

930
01:13:52,886 --> 01:13:54,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you can get it.</font>

931
01:13:56,932 --> 01:13:57,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

932
01:14:01,561 --> 01:14:03,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to leave.</font>

933
01:14:06,817 --> 01:14:08,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I forgot my coat.</font>

934
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:09,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll get it.</font>

935
01:14:26,962 --> 01:14:28,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

936
01:14:46,189 --> 01:14:50,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've waited a lifetime
for something like Swan.</font>

937
01:14:50,485 --> 01:14:52,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">I worked a year
developing her.</font>

938
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:55,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's not yours to trade.</font>

939
01:14:55,365 --> 01:14:57,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now you have the money
to make the exchange.</font>

940
01:14:57,909 --> 01:14:59,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will make sure
you get the credit.</font>

941
01:14:59,953 --> 01:15:02,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just need
more time. Please.</font>

942
01:15:02,581 --> 01:15:03,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do they have on you?</font>

943
01:15:03,873 --> 01:15:05,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw something
I was not supposed to.</font>

944
01:15:05,917 --> 01:15:07,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">What did you see?</font>

945
01:15:09,421 --> 01:15:11,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't get Swan
for free.</font>

946
01:15:11,548 --> 01:15:14,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was there the night
they killed Dmitri Ustinov.</font>

947
01:15:14,217 --> 01:15:16,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">For telling you that,
they would cut my throat.</font>

948
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:19,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you help me?</font>

949
01:15:20,056 --> 01:15:22,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't have
a fucking choice.</font>

950
01:16:18,073 --> 01:16:19,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">What would you give me</font>

951
01:16:19,658 --> 01:16:21,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">if I told you how to
get rid of Katerina?</font>

952
01:16:26,957 --> 01:16:28,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you want?</font>

953
01:16:30,293 --> 01:16:32,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, am I too late?</font>

954
01:16:33,463 --> 01:16:34,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, we're closed.</font>

955
01:16:34,672 --> 01:16:36,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can come back in the morning.
We open at 9:00.</font>

956
01:16:36,675 --> 01:16:37,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not going
to be here tomorrow.</font>

957
01:16:38,051 --> 01:16:39,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is there any way
you can make an exception?</font>

958
01:16:40,345 --> 01:16:42,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please. I wanted
to open an account</font>

959
01:16:42,347 --> 01:16:43,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">for a family member...</font>

960
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:44,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">in case anything
happens to me.</font>

961
01:16:45,016 --> 01:16:46,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't let you in.</font>

962
01:16:46,393 --> 01:16:47,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, maybe you could
get the form,</font>

963
01:16:48,061 --> 01:16:49,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I could buy you
a coffee?</font>

964
01:16:49,604 --> 01:16:52,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">We could
fill them out together.</font>

965
01:16:53,775 --> 01:16:55,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you have your passport,
and all the information?</font>

966
01:16:55,277 --> 01:16:56,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. Yes,
I have it all here.</font>

967
01:16:56,569 --> 01:16:58,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Excellent.
Oh, thank you.</font>

968
01:17:24,806 --> 01:17:25,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">Marta?</font>

969
01:17:34,065 --> 01:17:35,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">Marta?</font>

970
01:17:58,215 --> 01:18:00,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ever been on a farm?</font>

971
01:18:00,759 --> 01:18:04,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what it smells like,
when you butcher an animal.</font>

972
01:18:05,264 --> 01:18:07,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">I took my time with her.</font>

973
01:18:08,391 --> 01:18:12,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you would see what happens
when you tell secrets.</font>

974
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:15,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, please, please.</font>

975
01:18:15,231 --> 01:18:17,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is your only warning.</font>

976
01:18:18,819 --> 01:18:19,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now...</font>

977
01:18:20,570 --> 01:18:21,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">call the police.</font>

978
01:18:31,207 --> 01:18:32,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where the fuck
have you been?</font>

979
01:18:40,591 --> 01:18:41,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">Close your door.</font>

980
01:18:49,015 --> 01:18:50,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, Marble surfaced.</font>

981
01:18:50,768 --> 01:18:52,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus Christ. Here?</font>

982
01:18:53,354 --> 01:18:54,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">Vienna.</font>

983
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:55,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't say anything?</font>

984
01:18:55,980 --> 01:18:57,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is that?</font>

985
01:18:57,399 --> 01:18:58,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a warning.</font>

986
01:19:00,235 --> 01:19:01,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">She is a fucking Sparrow.</font>

987
01:19:02,070 --> 01:19:03,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">Told you she was
way out of your league.</font>

988
01:19:03,863 --> 01:19:06,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think
she's still recruitable.</font>

989
01:19:06,283 --> 01:19:07,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now that we know
what we're dealing with,</font>

990
01:19:07,743 --> 01:19:08,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">maybe even more so.</font>

991
01:19:08,993 --> 01:19:10,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">If she's a Sparrow...</font>

992
01:19:10,203 --> 01:19:12,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">we can't trust a fucking word
that comes out of her mouth.</font>

993
01:19:14,707 --> 01:19:15,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

994
01:19:17,002 --> 01:19:18,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">When?</font>

995
01:19:18,462 --> 01:19:20,920
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And you came home
to find her like this?</i></font>

996
01:19:21,297 --> 01:19:23,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

997
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:28,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">This wasn't
just a break-in.</font>

998
01:19:28,305 --> 01:19:30,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">This was torture,
punishment.</font>

999
01:19:30,765 --> 01:19:33,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any idea why someone
would do this to her?</font>

1000
01:19:36,771 --> 01:19:38,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened
to your eye?</font>

1001
01:19:41,734 --> 01:19:43,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you
get along with her?</font>

1002
01:19:44,738 --> 01:19:47,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">You seem upset.
Of course I'm fucking upset!</font>

1003
01:19:54,872 --> 01:19:56,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know something,
don't you?</font>

1004
01:19:58,210 --> 01:20:00,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoever it is
you're shielding...</font>

1005
01:20:00,921 --> 01:20:03,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">whoever you are
scared of...</font>

1006
01:20:03,756 --> 01:20:05,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">we can protect you.
May I go?</font>

1007
01:20:10,514 --> 01:20:12,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm assuming
you guys were pretty close.</font>

1008
01:20:14,350 --> 01:20:16,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must be pretty scared.</font>

1009
01:20:17,145 --> 01:20:18,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">For yourself.</font>

1010
01:20:18,980 --> 01:20:20,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I was in Moscow,</font>

1011
01:20:20,315 --> 01:20:23,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">they talked about a program
that Khrushchev had set up.</font>

1012
01:20:23,777 --> 01:20:28,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">Young officers. Trained to
seduce and manipulate.</font>

1013
01:20:28,364 --> 01:20:29,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">They called 'em Sparrows.</font>

1014
01:20:30,576 --> 01:20:32,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is what
she was, right?</font>

1015
01:20:32,536 --> 01:20:34,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">The thing I just cannot
wrap my head around...</font>

1016
01:20:34,662 --> 01:20:37,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">is why a man
would put his niece</font>

1017
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:39,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">through somethin'
like that.</font>

1018
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:50,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was told
to take a man to a hotel.</font>

1019
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:51,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">To get information.</font>

1020
01:20:53,806 --> 01:20:56,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">They said he was
an enemy of the state.</font>

1021
01:20:57,101 --> 01:20:58,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">And in exchange,</font>

1022
01:20:58,354 --> 01:21:00,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">my mother would get
the doctor she needed.</font>

1023
01:21:02,815 --> 01:21:06,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Instead, they cut his throat,
and he died on top of me.</font>

1024
01:21:09,823 --> 01:21:13,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">There could be no witnesses,
so my uncle gave me a choice.</font>

1025
01:21:13,534 --> 01:21:16,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">Die, or become a Sparrow.</font>

1026
01:21:17,331 --> 01:21:19,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">What they did to Marta
was a message.</font>

1027
01:21:19,207 --> 01:21:21,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">They cut her open to show me
what they'll do to me...</font>

1028
01:21:21,417 --> 01:21:22,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">if I don't give them
what they want.</font>

1029
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:24,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do they want?
A name.</font>

1030
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:26,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">They think you're
running an agent.</font>

1031
01:21:26,881 --> 01:21:28,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you think?</font>

1032
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:29,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care.</font>

1033
01:21:30,802 --> 01:21:32,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just want
my mother to be safe.</font>

1034
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:34,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">The men that you work for,
men like your uncle...</font>

1035
01:21:34,555 --> 01:21:36,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">they'll never let you go
no matter what you give them.</font>

1036
01:21:36,766 --> 01:21:38,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's how they function.</font>

1037
01:21:38,685 --> 01:21:40,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">You only matter because of
what you can do for them.</font>

1038
01:21:40,979 --> 01:21:43,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't exist
unless they say so.</font>

1039
01:21:45,109 --> 01:21:49,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">And not just now. I mean,
when you were dancing...</font>

1040
01:21:50,279 --> 01:21:51,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">you were dancing for them.</font>

1041
01:21:51,739 --> 01:21:53,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because they were
lettin' you.</font>

1042
01:21:53,283 --> 01:21:54,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean,
you see it now, right?</font>

1043
01:21:54,659 --> 01:21:57,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">You belonged to them,
pretty much your whole life.</font>

1044
01:22:01,375 --> 01:22:04,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, Dominika, work with me.</font>

1045
01:22:06,421 --> 01:22:08,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make this something
that you own</font>

1046
01:22:08,548 --> 01:22:10,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">for the first time
in your life.</font>

1047
01:22:12,386 --> 01:22:15,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">And make them
fucking pay.</font>

1048
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:17,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it
you want from me?</font>

1049
01:22:17,306 --> 01:22:18,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever you can give us.</font>

1050
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:21,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if I had my choice...</font>

1051
01:22:21,185 --> 01:22:22,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">access to your uncle.</font>

1052
01:22:23,146 --> 01:22:24,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be your spy?</font>

1053
01:22:25,189 --> 01:22:28,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that any different
from being his?</font>

1054
01:22:28,652 --> 01:22:31,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, because I would never
ask you to do what he did.</font>

1055
01:22:31,654 --> 01:22:33,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing's worth that.</font>

1056
01:22:35,158 --> 01:22:36,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to sleep.</font>

1057
01:22:36,993 --> 01:22:38,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you
take my room?</font>

1058
01:22:46,712 --> 01:22:49,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, you asked me why
I fired the gun in Moscow?</font>

1059
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:53,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, the man I was protecting
had everything to lose.</font>

1060
01:22:53,801 --> 01:22:56,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was benefiting
from the system...</font>

1061
01:22:56,220 --> 01:22:58,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">but when he saw what was
happening in his name...</font>

1062
01:22:59,015 --> 01:23:01,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">he didn't just say
that he didn't know.</font>

1063
01:23:01,268 --> 01:23:03,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">He risked his life.
He risked everything.</font>

1064
01:23:03,811 --> 01:23:05,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">He didn't deserve to die
in a cellar somewhere.</font>

1065
01:23:06,148 --> 01:23:07,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you do this...</font>

1066
01:23:07,940 --> 01:23:10,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll do everything in my
power to protect you.</font>

1067
01:23:40,181 --> 01:23:41,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I trust you?</font>

1068
01:23:44,144 --> 01:23:45,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">I promise you can.</font>

1069
01:23:56,364 --> 01:23:58,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait. Wait, don't.</font>

1070
01:25:06,225 --> 01:25:07,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

1071
01:25:08,020 --> 01:25:09,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

1072
01:25:14,525 --> 01:25:17,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">I danced
my first solo to this.</font>

1073
01:25:18,447 --> 01:25:19,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's Grieg.</font>

1074
01:25:20,907 --> 01:25:25,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was so nervous the night before,
I couldn't sleep.</font>

1075
01:25:26,537 --> 01:25:29,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I played this music
in my room...</font>

1076
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:33,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">and, after I fell asleep,
I dreamed that...</font>

1077
01:25:33,587 --> 01:25:37,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">the music was color,
and I could paint...</font>

1078
01:25:37,798 --> 01:25:42,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">over all the audiences'
faces with my hands.</font>

1079
01:25:54,649 --> 01:25:57,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry about
what happened to you.</font>

1080
01:26:00,863 --> 01:26:03,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I'm really very glad
that you're here.</font>

1081
01:26:03,908 --> 01:26:05,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me too.</font>

1082
01:26:05,534 --> 01:26:06,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you sure about this?</font>

1083
01:26:08,537 --> 01:26:10,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Well, listen.</font>

1084
01:26:15,545 --> 01:26:17,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is what
I want you to do.</font>

1085
01:26:17,421 --> 01:26:19,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go back to your
normal routine.</font>

1086
01:26:19,298 --> 01:26:23,384
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Go into work,
and write a report about me.</i></font>

1087
01:26:23,552 --> 01:26:26,671
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>About the time we spent,
and how close we've gotten.</i></font>

1088
01:26:27,724 --> 01:26:30,181
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Say that I'm a fool,
and you've got me on the hook.</i></font>

1089
01:26:30,351 --> 01:26:33,390
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Tell them that I'm ambitious,
but that I drink.</i></font>

1090
01:26:33,563 --> 01:26:35,332
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And that I have something
to prove to my father...</i></font>

1091
01:26:35,356 --> 01:26:37,769
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>which means
I will make a mistake.</i></font>

1092
01:26:37,943 --> 01:26:39,934
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Then I need you to go home.</i></font>

1093
01:26:40,112 --> 01:26:41,978
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Police will be finished
with your apartment</i></font>

1094
01:26:42,072 --> 01:26:43,186
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>by this evening.</i></font>

1095
01:26:43,364 --> 01:26:44,524
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Then just wait for my signal.</i></font>

1096
01:26:48,912 --> 01:26:49,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello?</font>

1097
01:26:59,463 --> 01:27:01,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just gonna
ask you some</font>

1098
01:27:01,591 --> 01:27:03,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">routine questions to begin.</font>

1099
01:27:03,426 --> 01:27:04,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">Name?</font>

1100
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:06,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dominika Egorova.</font>

1101
01:27:07,305 --> 01:27:09,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you eat breakfast
this morning?</font>

1102
01:27:09,224 --> 01:27:10,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

1103
01:27:10,307 --> 01:27:11,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you an officer</font>

1104
01:27:11,685 --> 01:27:13,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">of the Russian
Intelligence Service?</font>

1105
01:27:13,478 --> 01:27:14,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

1106
01:27:15,146 --> 01:27:16,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you here because</font>

1107
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:18,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">CIA Officer Nate Nash
recruited you?</font>

1108
01:27:18,899 --> 01:27:19,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

1109
01:27:21,987 --> 01:27:24,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you willing to work
for the American government?</font>

1110
01:27:24,448 --> 01:27:25,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

1111
01:27:25,990 --> 01:27:28,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you intend to
give us genuine information?</font>

1112
01:27:29,327 --> 01:27:30,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes or no?</font>

1113
01:27:30,494 --> 01:27:31,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

1114
01:27:31,579 --> 01:27:32,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would you
do that?</font>

1115
01:27:32,663 --> 01:27:34,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought it was
just yes or no?</font>

1116
01:27:34,457 --> 01:27:36,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just curious.</font>

1117
01:27:36,877 --> 01:27:38,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know the nature
of the men I work for.</font>

1118
01:27:39,045 --> 01:27:40,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">So why work for them?</font>

1119
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:42,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">They gave me no choice.
I have a question.</font>

1120
01:27:42,548 --> 01:27:44,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">You only spike
when Nate's name comes up.</font>

1121
01:27:45,092 --> 01:27:47,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you engage in sexual
intercourse with him?</font>

1122
01:27:47,386 --> 01:27:48,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, that's...
Take it easy.</font>

1123
01:27:48,471 --> 01:27:49,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because that's
what you do, right?</font>

1124
01:27:49,555 --> 01:27:50,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">Marty? Marty.</font>

1125
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:51,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what
you're trained for.</font>

1126
01:27:51,725 --> 01:27:52,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anybody ever
tell you that...</font>

1127
01:27:52,809 --> 01:27:54,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you need
to know, <i>bratok?</i></font>

1128
01:27:55,060 --> 01:27:56,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">Big brother?</font>

1129
01:27:56,729 --> 01:27:58,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please answer the question.</font>

1130
01:27:58,355 --> 01:28:00,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'd need to know if
you're emotionally involved.</font>

1131
01:28:00,274 --> 01:28:01,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">The answer is no.</font>

1132
01:28:05,070 --> 01:28:06,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, are you satisfied?</font>

1133
01:28:07,573 --> 01:28:09,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.
If I am to work for you...</font>

1134
01:28:09,367 --> 01:28:12,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will need money transferred
to a bank account in Vienna.</font>

1135
01:28:13,622 --> 01:28:15,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">$30,000 to start.</font>

1136
01:28:17,333 --> 01:28:19,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know
what you and Nate discussed...</font>

1137
01:28:19,168 --> 01:28:20,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I think we're getting
a little ahead of ourselves.</font>

1138
01:28:20,712 --> 01:28:22,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'd have to see
what you brought us.</font>

1139
01:28:22,631 --> 01:28:24,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">If it's significant...</font>

1140
01:28:24,256 --> 01:28:26,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about a senator's
chief of staff?</font>

1141
01:28:26,217 --> 01:28:27,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me?</font>

1142
01:28:27,676 --> 01:28:30,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">A chief of staff
run by the SVR?</font>

1143
01:28:30,180 --> 01:28:32,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's agreed
to sell information</font>

1144
01:28:32,306 --> 01:28:33,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">on a satellite
defense system.</font>

1145
01:28:34,016 --> 01:28:36,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm to fly to London on
Friday to meet with her.</font>

1146
01:28:38,771 --> 01:28:41,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shall I provide you with
the account information?</font>

1147
01:28:59,292 --> 01:29:00,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, there she is.</font>

1148
01:29:15,350 --> 01:29:16,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's to the left.</font>

1149
01:29:22,815 --> 01:29:23,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll get it.
We're good.</font>

1150
01:29:35,953 --> 01:29:37,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing here?</font>

1151
01:29:37,372 --> 01:29:39,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thought you might
need some help</font>

1152
01:29:39,164 --> 01:29:41,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">after what happened
to poor Marta.</font>

1153
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:45,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course, you were lucky
not to be harmed yourself.</font>

1154
01:29:45,588 --> 01:29:47,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">I appreciate your concern.</font>

1155
01:29:48,091 --> 01:29:49,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">Though I do wonder how
Swan would react</font>

1156
01:29:49,301 --> 01:29:50,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">if she saw me with you.</font>

1157
01:29:50,676 --> 01:29:52,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you really
want to be the one</font>

1158
01:29:52,095 --> 01:29:53,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">to blow
this whole operation?</font>

1159
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:56,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">Director Egorov would be
very displeased.</font>

1160
01:29:57,391 --> 01:30:01,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go upstairs, room 624.
I'll call you if I need you.</font>

1161
01:30:02,104 --> 01:30:03,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go.</font>

1162
01:30:19,288 --> 01:30:21,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who the hell is that?
- He's got a key.</font>

1163
01:30:21,750 --> 01:30:23,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did she say anybody else
was gonna be in that room?</font>

1164
01:30:23,501 --> 01:30:26,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. I think that's...
Yeah, it's Volontov.</font>

1165
01:30:27,796 --> 01:30:28,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's her boss.</font>

1166
01:30:36,597 --> 01:30:37,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">Vodka.</font>

1167
01:30:56,451 --> 01:30:57,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do I know you?</font>

1168
01:30:57,534 --> 01:30:59,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have a friend
in common.</font>

1169
01:31:00,829 --> 01:31:01,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is she?</font>

1170
01:31:02,039 --> 01:31:04,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unfortunately, Marta
wasn't able to make it.</font>

1171
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:06,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">So she sent me.</font>

1172
01:31:08,380 --> 01:31:09,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

1173
01:31:09,881 --> 01:31:11,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll just be leaving.</font>

1174
01:31:25,604 --> 01:31:27,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">You really think
I care if people know</font>

1175
01:31:27,856 --> 01:31:29,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">who I'm meeting with?</font>

1176
01:31:29,818 --> 01:31:31,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think in this case,
you might.</font>

1177
01:31:31,528 --> 01:31:34,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Marta's a known
intelligence officer.</font>

1178
01:31:34,447 --> 01:31:35,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">If photographs
of your relationship</font>

1179
01:31:35,614 --> 01:31:36,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">were to go public...</font>

1180
01:31:36,783 --> 01:31:39,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">you would lose your security
clearance, and your job.</font>

1181
01:31:39,661 --> 01:31:41,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I don't think
that any of that is necessary.</font>

1182
01:31:41,829 --> 01:31:43,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're here for business,
as am I.</font>

1183
01:31:43,747 --> 01:31:47,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">$250,000 was the figure
that you agreed upon.</font>

1184
01:31:47,585 --> 01:31:50,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your daughter's tuition
payments are coming up.</font>

1185
01:31:50,796 --> 01:31:53,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe your ex-husband
is about to lose another job.</font>

1186
01:31:56,261 --> 01:31:57,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you think
you would be</font>

1187
01:31:57,511 --> 01:31:59,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">more comfortable
in a private room?</font>

1188
01:32:00,097 --> 01:32:01,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where do they find you?</font>

1189
01:32:02,057 --> 01:32:03,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">Follow me.</font>

1190
01:32:03,184 --> 01:32:04,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, here we go.
Mmm-hmm.</font>

1191
01:32:04,601 --> 01:32:06,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's get this show
on the road.</font>

1192
01:32:10,358 --> 01:32:12,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is Colonel
Maxim Volontov.</font>

1193
01:32:12,694 --> 01:32:15,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's the chief of
the Budapest <i>rezidentura.</i></font>

1194
01:32:16,448 --> 01:32:18,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make me a drink,
would you, Boris?</font>

1195
01:32:20,368 --> 01:32:21,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's get on with it.</font>

1196
01:32:21,744 --> 01:32:23,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">You heard her.
Make her a drink.</font>

1197
01:32:25,164 --> 01:32:26,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">So.</font>

1198
01:32:27,458 --> 01:32:28,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shall we proceed?</font>

1199
01:32:28,667 --> 01:32:30,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just want to be clear.</font>

1200
01:32:30,587 --> 01:32:34,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm here in a strictly
exploratory manner.</font>

1201
01:32:34,256 --> 01:32:36,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">As long as what you have
to offer is of value...</font>

1202
01:32:36,301 --> 01:32:38,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure we will have
no difficulty.</font>

1203
01:32:38,219 --> 01:32:42,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm chief of staff
to a United States senator.</font>

1204
01:32:42,849 --> 01:32:45,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">Last person that had my job's
head of the fucking CIA.</font>

1205
01:32:45,601 --> 01:32:48,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">Being in the room with me.</font>

1206
01:32:48,438 --> 01:32:50,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fucking value.</font>

1207
01:32:51,190 --> 01:32:52,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I think
she's drunk.</font>

1208
01:32:53,025 --> 01:32:54,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think?
She's drunk.</font>

1209

<font color="#FFFFFF">as you say you are...</font>

1211
01:32:56,779 --> 01:32:59,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">then you don't
want to waste any time.</font>

1212
01:32:59,532 --> 01:33:01,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, do you have
anything to sell?</font>

1213
01:33:02,034 --> 01:33:04,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have the first
set of discs with me.</font>

1214
01:33:05,329 --> 01:33:06,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Today.</font>

1215
01:33:06,789 --> 01:33:08,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just want to be clear
that I'm not doing this...</font>

1216
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">'cause I'm an ideologue
or pacifist</font>

1217
01:33:11,711 --> 01:33:13,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">or something, you know.</font>

1218
01:33:13,421 --> 01:33:16,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are the discs,
Stephanie?</font>

1219
01:33:16,341 --> 01:33:17,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's my money?</font>

1220
01:33:17,550 --> 01:33:20,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">$250,000 per delivery
as agreed.</font>

1221
01:33:30,188 --> 01:33:31,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yep.</font>

1222
01:33:36,778 --> 01:33:37,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, sorry.</font>

1223
01:33:45,328 --> 01:33:47,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just need
to authenticate them.</font>

1224
01:34:04,264 --> 01:34:07,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you give me
a real pour, huh, Boris?</font>

1225
01:34:09,060 --> 01:34:11,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you
get it yourself?</font>

1226
01:34:12,438 --> 01:34:13,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't mind if I do.</font>

1227
01:34:24,576 --> 01:34:25,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything all right?</font>

1228
01:34:26,368 --> 01:34:28,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just have to wait
for them to load.</font>

1229
01:34:46,180 --> 01:34:47,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me, Boris.</font>

1230
01:34:48,099 --> 01:34:52,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">You got a little babushka
back in Moscow?</font>

1231
01:34:52,270 --> 01:34:53,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Course you do.</font>

1232
01:34:54,189 --> 01:34:56,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never ceases

1233
01:34:56,399 --> 01:34:59,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are Russian women
so sexy?</font>

1234
01:34:59,860 --> 01:35:01,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">All the men
look like toads.</font>

1235
01:35:11,372 --> 01:35:12,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no.
No. Don't you.</font>

1236
01:35:16,002 --> 01:35:17,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are you going?</font>

1237
01:35:17,295 --> 01:35:18,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna go buy her
some time.</font>

1238
01:35:20,131 --> 01:35:22,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why is it taking so long?
Just one more minute.</font>

1239
01:35:23,301 --> 01:35:25,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">God,
who the fuck is that?</font>

1240
01:35:28,890 --> 01:35:30,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just checking.</font>

1241
01:35:30,182 --> 01:35:31,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is everything all right
with your room, sir?</font>

1242
01:35:31,309 --> 01:35:32,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine.</font>

1243
01:35:32,435 --> 01:35:34,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shall I
check the minibar?</font>

1244
01:35:34,145 --> 01:35:35,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no need.</font>

1245
01:35:40,859 --> 01:35:42,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry to disturb you.</font>

1246
01:35:53,538 --> 01:35:55,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's finished. Everything
seems to be in order.</font>

1247
01:35:56,960 --> 01:36:00,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good. Because if I have to spend
another minute with this cunt...</font>

1248
01:36:00,255 --> 01:36:03,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to shoot her
in the face.</font>

1249
01:36:03,841 --> 01:36:05,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did she get 'em?</font>

1250
01:36:05,426 --> 01:36:06,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">She did.</font>

1251
01:36:08,179 --> 01:36:09,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice accent.</font>

1252
01:36:09,764 --> 01:36:11,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll leave now.</font>

1253
01:36:11,556 --> 01:36:13,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wait an hour
and then you go.</font>

1254
01:36:13,350 --> 01:36:15,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll be in touch
for the next delivery.</font>

1255
01:36:19,731 --> 01:36:20,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure thing.</font>

1256
01:36:46,384 --> 01:36:48,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck it.</font>

1257
01:36:56,435 --> 01:36:58,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Oh. Oh.
She took the money.</font>

1258
01:36:58,438 --> 01:36:59,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">She took the money!</font>

1259
01:36:59,980 --> 01:37:01,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">There you go.</font>

1260
01:37:01,274 --> 01:37:03,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go get the discs, take
them back to the field office.</font>

1261
01:37:03,943 --> 01:37:06,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will follow as soon as
I get this squared away.</font>

1262
01:38:26,234 --> 01:38:27,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah?</font>

1263
01:38:32,948 --> 01:38:35,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make the necessary
arrangements.</font>

1264
01:38:35,283 --> 01:38:37,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Change of plans.
We go directly to Heathrow.</font>

1265
01:38:38,162 --> 01:38:41,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Moscow wants to
congratulate us in person.</font>

1266
01:38:41,373 --> 01:38:42,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll call Director Egorov.</font>

1267
01:38:43,167 --> 01:38:44,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">No need.</font>

1268
01:38:44,460 --> 01:38:47,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">Director Egorov
gave the order himself.</font>

1269
01:38:47,671 --> 01:38:50,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">The discs
and your passport.</font>

1270
01:38:58,850 --> 01:39:00,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">Turn the car around.</font>

1271
01:39:16,117 --> 01:39:17,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah?</font>

1273
01:39:19,787 --> 01:39:21,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you
talking about?</font>

1274
01:39:21,413 --> 01:39:23,529
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Our guys outside went after
the money too early.</i></font>

1275
01:39:23,707 --> 01:39:26,746
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>She panicked. Stepped in
front of a fucking truck.</i></font>

1276
01:39:26,918 --> 01:39:29,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the fuck?</font>

1277
01:39:29,337 --> 01:39:31,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think they had somebody
in the hotel?</font>

1278
01:39:31,381 --> 01:39:32,381
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I would've.</i></font>

1279
01:39:32,550 --> 01:39:33,789
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>If they think
she tipped us off,</i></font>

1280
01:39:33,885 --> 01:39:35,216
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>they're gonna kill her.</i></font>

1281
01:39:35,386 --> 01:39:38,798
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And Nate, the tail said
her car changed direction.</i></font>

1282
01:39:38,972 --> 01:39:40,453

headed to Heathrow.</i></font>

1283
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:44,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck, Trish. We fucked her.
We have fucked her!</font>

1284
01:39:51,485 --> 01:39:53,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">You look nervous.</font>

1285
01:40:33,194 --> 01:40:34,854

terminal two.</font>

1286

<font color="#FFFFFF">Enjoy your flight.</font>

1293
01:41:48,644 --> 01:41:49,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck!</font>

1294
01:42:04,743 --> 01:42:07,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">I always had my doubts
about her.</font>

1295
01:42:08,331 --> 01:42:09,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's my niece.</font>

1296
01:42:09,748 --> 01:42:10,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

1297
01:42:11,042 --> 01:42:12,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">My brother's daughter.</font>

1298
01:42:12,667 --> 01:42:15,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me the discs.
Please.</font>

1299
01:42:16,796 --> 01:42:17,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course.</font>

1300
01:42:18,966 --> 01:42:20,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.
Take him away.</font>

1301
01:42:38,903 --> 01:42:41,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you give Ms. Boucher
to the Americans?</font>

1302
01:42:44,867 --> 01:42:45,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

1303
01:42:46,077 --> 01:42:47,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who did?</font>

1304
01:42:47,453 --> 01:42:48,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

1305
01:42:54,126 --> 01:42:55,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can start.</font>

1306
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:36,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's start again.</font>

1312
01:44:15,291 --> 01:44:17,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love my country.</font>

1313
01:44:35,810 --> 01:44:38,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">You gave Boucher
to the Americans.</font>

1314
01:44:41,108 --> 01:44:42,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">For money?</font>

1315
01:44:44,194 --> 01:44:46,653

1328
01:46:48,402 --> 01:46:49,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not your fault.</font>

1329
01:46:50,237 --> 01:46:52,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you have to tell them
what they want to know.</font>

1330
01:46:52,655 --> 01:46:54,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please.</font>

1331
01:46:54,742 --> 01:46:59,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can only protect you

1332

1333
01:47:04,585 --> 01:47:07,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is no other mission

01:47:29,484 --> 01:47:31,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't want
to give up now.</font>

1342
01:47:32,195 --> 01:47:33,356

1350
01:48:19,118 --> 01:48:21,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course. I'm innocent.</font>

1351

01:49:00,492 --> 01:49:02,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">feelings for the American.</font>

1361
01:49:03,369 --> 01:49:05,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">She has made
a fool of you, Ivan.</font>

1362
01:49:06,247 --> 01:49:07,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">Send her back to Nash.</font>

1363
01:49:07,875 --> 01:49:09,661
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Have Matorin shadow her.</i></font>

1364
01:49:09,835 --> 01:49:12,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">If she is compromised,
he will find out.</font>

1365
01:49:13,588 --> 01:49:15,579
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>The Americans
will respond.</i></font>

1366
01:49:16,466 --> 01:49:17,957
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Nothing we can't weather.</i></font>

1367
01:49:18,135 --> 01:49:19,876
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And what of Dominika?</i></font>

1368
01:49:20,345 --> 01:49:22,104
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I leave that
decision to her uncle.</i></font>

1369
01:49:24,015 --> 01:49:26,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shall we tell the president
you prioritized...</font>

1370
01:49:26,601 --> 01:49:28,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">the safety of your niece
over the mission?</font>

1371
01:49:28,895 --> 01:49:30,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">If she's compromised...</font>

1372
01:49:32,690 --> 01:49:36,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">I promise you,
she will be eliminated.</font>

1373
01:49:37,904 --> 01:49:39,815
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Thank you, Ivan.</i></font>

1374
01:49:40,908 --> 01:49:43,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're welcome,
Chief Zakharov.</font>

1375
01:49:45,912 --> 01:49:47,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enjoy your night.</font>

1376
01:50:02,554 --> 01:50:04,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd ask you
how you got in,</font>

1377
01:50:04,430 --> 01:50:06,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">but this is what
we taught you, isn't it?</font>

1378
01:50:07,850 --> 01:50:10,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did they grant my request?</font>

1379
01:50:10,436 --> 01:50:12,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, they did.</font>

1380
01:50:39,757 --> 01:50:41,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were right.</font>

1381
01:50:42,469 --> 01:50:43,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am like you, Uncle.</font>

1382
01:51:20,506 --> 01:51:21,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God.</font>

1383
01:51:22,926 --> 01:51:24,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, thank God.</font>

1384
01:51:28,515 --> 01:51:30,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know
what this looks like, right?</font>

1385
01:51:32,435 --> 01:51:35,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">They just let you go?
Why would they do that?</font>

1386
01:51:35,771 --> 01:51:38,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I told them
that you would trust me now.</font>

1387
01:51:39,359 --> 01:51:41,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enough to give me
the name of the mole.</font>

1388
01:51:44,323 --> 01:51:46,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you know
that I can't do that.</font>

1389
01:51:46,783 --> 01:51:48,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course I do.</font>

1390
01:51:49,328 --> 01:51:50,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what next, then?</font>

1391
01:51:50,828 --> 01:51:52,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to go
to America...</font>

1392
01:51:53,414 --> 01:51:55,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">where I can be safe.
Please.</font>

1393
01:51:57,252 --> 01:51:58,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.
And my mother?</font>

1394
01:51:59,546 --> 01:52:02,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">It'll take some time,
but we can get her out, yeah.</font>

1395
01:52:02,716 --> 01:52:04,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the money
that I was promised?</font>

1396
01:52:04,885 --> 01:52:07,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll get it.
$30,000 in a bank in Vienna.</font>

1397
01:52:07,554 --> 01:52:09,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">We couldn't release payment
while you were in custody.</font>

1398
01:52:09,847 --> 01:52:11,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not enough.</font>

1399
01:52:12,225 --> 01:52:14,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">How much do you want?</font>

1400
01:52:15,229 --> 01:52:17,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need $250,000.</font>

1401
01:52:17,939 --> 01:52:19,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">For resettlement.</font>

1402
01:52:19,899 --> 01:52:20,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

1403
01:52:22,735 --> 01:52:24,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're helping me.</font>

1404
01:52:24,904 --> 01:52:27,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">For no obvious advantage.</font>

1405
01:52:27,949 --> 01:52:30,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not what I expected.</font>

1406
01:52:30,452 --> 01:52:32,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I hadn't waved you off
at the airport,</font>

1407
01:52:32,662 --> 01:52:34,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">what would you have done?</font>

1408
01:52:34,372 --> 01:52:35,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would've killed him
for you.</font>

1409
01:53:16,832 --> 01:53:17,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nate?</font>

1410
01:53:25,716 --> 01:53:26,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nate?</font>

1411
01:54:44,086 --> 01:54:45,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know
what this is?</font>

1412
01:54:47,046 --> 01:54:49,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">They use it
for skin grafting.</font>

1413
01:54:49,548 --> 01:54:50,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Burn victims.</font>

1414
01:54:51,760 --> 01:54:55,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">A blade so fine,
you barely bleed.</font>

1415
01:54:55,346 --> 01:54:56,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know
how long it takes</font>

1416
01:54:57,015 --> 01:54:59,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">to peel the skin
from a human being?</font>

1417
01:54:59,434 --> 01:55:02,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hours. Even if you are
very good at it.</font>

1418
01:55:04,230 --> 01:55:07,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I...
I take my time with it.</font>

1419
01:55:08,777 --> 01:55:11,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">Layer by layer.</font>

1420
01:55:13,573 --> 01:55:17,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">Until I see
the white of the bone.</font>

1421
01:55:21,414 --> 01:55:23,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know
what we want to know...</font>

1422
01:55:24,751 --> 01:55:27,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I won't stop until long
after you're ready to talk.</font>

1423
01:55:28,587 --> 01:55:30,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you pass out,</font>

1424
01:55:30,256 --> 01:55:33,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will inject you
with a stimulant.</font>

1425
01:55:33,217 --> 01:55:36,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll stay conscious
until we're finished.</font>

1426
01:56:06,126 --> 01:56:07,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the name,
Nate?</font>

1427
01:56:07,877 --> 01:56:10,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the name?</font>

1428
01:56:10,713 --> 01:56:11,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">No?</font>

1429
01:56:12,841 --> 01:56:14,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want more?</font>

1430
01:56:14,759 --> 01:56:17,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Please.</font>

1431
01:56:17,429 --> 01:56:19,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we go deeper.</font>

1432
01:56:22,184 --> 01:56:23,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

1433
01:56:36,989 --> 01:56:38,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">No?</font>

1434
01:56:40,118 --> 01:56:42,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, Nate.
The name.</font>

1435
01:56:42,496 --> 01:56:44,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the name?</font>

1436
01:56:46,625 --> 01:56:47,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">No?</font>

1437
01:56:49,043 --> 01:56:50,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give it to me.
Let me try.</font>

1438
01:56:52,255 --> 01:56:54,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, wait.</font>

1439
01:56:58,802 --> 01:57:00,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God!</font>

1440
01:57:10,064 --> 01:57:12,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">No?</font>

1441
01:58:16,631 --> 01:58:17,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nate?</font>

1442
01:58:17,966 --> 01:58:18,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nate.</font>

1443
01:58:19,050 --> 01:58:22,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">Call the Embassy.
The Embassy.</font>

1444
01:59:09,059 --> 01:59:11,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was you who killed Matorin,
wasn't it?</font>

1445
01:59:11,435 --> 01:59:12,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can explain.</font>

1446
01:59:12,770 --> 01:59:14,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure you can.</font>

1447
01:59:16,733 --> 01:59:19,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">My wife had dreams
of being a dancer.</font>

1448
01:59:19,319 --> 01:59:21,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Long before I met her.</font>

1449
01:59:21,570 --> 01:59:22,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course
she was nothing on you...</font>

1450
01:59:23,030 --> 01:59:26,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">but she used to dance for me
in our living room.</font>

1451
01:59:26,909 --> 01:59:28,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">When she fell ill...</font>

1452
01:59:28,912 --> 01:59:30,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">the Russian Embassy
in New York...</font>

1453
01:59:30,579 --> 01:59:33,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">refused to let an American
doctor operate on her.</font>

1454
01:59:34,708 --> 01:59:38,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some petty bureaucrat
I had offended...</font>

1455
01:59:38,253 --> 01:59:40,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">sentenced her to death.</font>

1456
01:59:40,422 --> 01:59:42,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">What passes for power.</font>

1457
01:59:44,886 --> 01:59:47,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you gave
the Americans Boucher.</font>

1458
01:59:47,930 --> 01:59:49,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only so they
would trust me.</font>

1459
01:59:49,474 --> 01:59:50,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now we
must trust you?</font>

1460
01:59:58,524 --> 02:00:04,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was born three days after
Stalin was laid in state.</font>

1461
02:00:05,614 --> 02:00:07,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">My father fought for him
during the war.</font>

1462
02:00:09,493 --> 02:00:12,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was a party member,
we were privileged.</font>

1463
02:00:16,292 --> 02:00:19,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">It took me years to realize
I had been born in a prison.</font>

1464
02:00:19,587 --> 02:00:21,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">Prison makes a beast
out of a man.</font>

1465
02:00:22,090 --> 02:00:25,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">I learned to cheat,
to lie...</font>

1466
02:00:25,217 --> 02:00:27,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">to do to others
before they do to me.</font>

1467
02:00:28,345 --> 02:00:32,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">To survive,
by any means.</font>

1468
02:00:33,268 --> 02:00:34,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I had to decide.</font>

1469
02:00:34,728 --> 02:00:37,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">Die in the prison
where I was born...</font>

1470
02:00:39,189 --> 02:00:41,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">or choose another side.</font>

1471
02:00:41,943 --> 02:00:43,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our clumsy
American friends...</font>

1472
02:00:44,612 --> 02:00:48,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">for whom individual freedom
is at least an aspiration.</font>

1473
02:00:50,868 --> 02:00:53,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">So now you know.
I am the mole.</font>

1474
02:00:54,831 --> 02:00:56,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am the man
you are looking for.</font>

1475
02:00:56,750 --> 02:00:58,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're free to hand me over
to your uncle...</font>

1476
02:00:58,167 --> 02:00:59,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">give the men
who did this to you</font>

1477
02:00:59,252 --> 02:01:00,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">what they want
and go home.</font>

1478
02:01:00,420 --> 02:01:02,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course,
there is another path.</font>

1479
02:01:02,546 --> 02:01:03,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">What would that be?</font>

1480
02:01:03,965 --> 02:01:06,457
<font color="#FFFFFF">After you turn me in,
you will be a hero...</font>

1481
02:01:07,176 --> 02:01:08,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">beyond suspicion.</font>

1482
02:01:09,970 --> 02:01:13,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">The ideal position
to take my place</font>

1483
02:01:13,766 --> 02:01:15,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">and continue my work
with the Americans.</font>

1484
02:01:16,060 --> 02:01:17,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make your uncle
and his kind pay</font>

1485
02:01:17,979 --> 02:01:19,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">for what they have done
to our country.</font>

1486
02:01:19,689 --> 02:01:20,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'll kill you.</font>

1487
02:01:21,356 --> 02:01:23,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something
will slay us all.</font>

1488
02:01:25,110 --> 02:01:28,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have the power to decide
whether or not I die in vain.</font>

1489
02:01:32,368 --> 02:01:35,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are better at this
than any of us.</font>

1490
02:01:35,747 --> 02:01:40,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the only way for you
to return to your mother.</font>

1491
02:01:41,836 --> 02:01:44,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">You sent Matorin,
didn't you?</font>

1492
02:01:45,131 --> 02:01:46,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I wouldn't
have a choice.</font>

1493
02:01:47,132 --> 02:01:49,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">So that you would see.</font>

1494
02:01:50,302 --> 02:01:51,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">You never did.</font>

1495
02:02:37,809 --> 02:02:38,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello?</font>

1496
02:02:40,561 --> 02:02:41,722
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Hello?</i></font>

1497
02:02:48,694 --> 02:02:49,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">I...</font>

1498
02:03:13,761 --> 02:03:14,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop.</font>

1499
02:03:18,265 --> 02:03:19,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">Face the wall.</font>

1500
02:03:23,229 --> 02:03:25,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to speak
with the Russian ambassador.</font>

1501
02:03:25,899 --> 02:03:27,667
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>My name is Mikhail Sergev.</i></font>

1502
02:03:27,692 --> 02:03:29,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am the ambassador
here in Budapest.</font>

1503
02:03:30,110 --> 02:03:31,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unfortunately,
the Hungarians</font>

1504
02:03:31,779 --> 02:03:33,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">are waiving
diplomatic immunity.</font>

1505
02:03:33,907 --> 02:03:35,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">Call Zakharov.</font>

1506
02:03:35,824 --> 02:03:39,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell him
I have what he wants.</font>

1507
02:03:41,497 --> 02:03:42,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have the name
of the mole.</font>

1508
02:03:43,123 --> 02:03:45,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you tell me?
And I'll pass it along.</font>

1509
02:03:48,921 --> 02:03:50,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen to me
very carefully.</font>

1510
02:03:51,090 --> 02:03:54,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are an errand boy.
I have an errand.</font>

1511
02:03:54,551 --> 02:03:56,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will call Zakharov.</font>

1512
02:03:56,095 --> 02:03:57,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will tell him
to make a trade.</font>

1513
02:03:57,721 --> 02:03:59,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">Me for the mole.</font>

1514
02:04:00,057 --> 02:04:01,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once it is arranged,</font>

1515
02:04:02,060 --> 02:04:04,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will give the name
to Zakharov personally.</font>

1516
02:04:06,064 --> 02:04:08,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do this right,
Mr. Ambassador,</font>

1517
02:04:08,358 --> 02:04:10,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I might even tell them
it was your idea.</font>

1518
02:04:12,153 --> 02:04:14,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll see what I can do.</font>

1519
02:04:17,658 --> 02:04:19,618
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Thank you, Director Zakharov.</i></font>

1520
02:04:19,661 --> 02:04:21,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">Speak of this
to no one else.</font>

1521
02:04:21,453 --> 02:04:22,453
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Yes, sir.</i></font>

1522
02:04:29,337 --> 02:04:31,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">No loose ends.</font>

1523
02:04:31,631 --> 02:04:33,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing that can come back
on the president.</font>

1524
02:04:34,091 --> 02:04:35,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the girl?</font>

1525
02:06:28,372 --> 02:06:29,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can uncuff her.</font>

1526
02:06:34,962 --> 02:06:37,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right,
this is how this is gonna go.</font>

1527
02:06:37,547 --> 02:06:39,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nate will escort you
part of the way.</font>

1528
02:06:40,009 --> 02:06:42,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once he confirms
the identity of our mole,</font>

1529
02:06:42,677 --> 02:06:43,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">you go on alone.</font>

1530
02:06:43,845 --> 02:06:45,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">You pass at the midpoint.
Don't stop.</font>

1531
02:06:46,140 --> 02:06:48,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't exchange a word.
Don't look back.</font>

1532
02:06:50,895 --> 02:06:52,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anything goes wrong,
we abort.</font>

1533
02:06:53,105 --> 02:06:56,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">You try to run,
we are authorized to shoot.</font>

1534
02:06:56,818 --> 02:06:59,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">We won't hesitate,
you understand?</font>

1535
02:07:00,404 --> 02:07:02,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, Nate,
it's time.</font>

1536
02:07:12,667 --> 02:07:15,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your uncle
will be very proud.</font>

1537
02:07:15,627 --> 02:07:16,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">He might be.</font>

1538
02:07:23,511 --> 02:07:26,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you gonna tell me
how you found out his name?</font>

1539
02:07:26,305 --> 02:07:28,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it going
to make a difference?</font>

1540
02:07:28,224 --> 02:07:30,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is
an investigation.</font>

1541
02:07:31,060 --> 02:07:32,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">They think it's me.</font>

1542
02:07:34,104 --> 02:07:37,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess that was the play
all along, huh?</font>

1543
02:07:38,900 --> 02:07:40,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop here.</font>

1544
02:07:42,654 --> 02:07:43,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got him back for you.</font>

1545
02:07:44,030 --> 02:07:45,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think
they're just gonna let him</font>

1546
02:07:45,658 --> 02:07:46,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">make it across alive?</font>

1547
02:07:47,118 --> 02:07:49,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">You realize you might have
just got him killed?</font>

1548
02:07:53,248 --> 02:07:55,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think one day
you will understand.</font>

1549
02:07:55,501 --> 02:07:58,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I don't think I will.</font>

1550
02:07:58,378 --> 02:08:00,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some things
can't be sacrificed.</font>

1551
02:08:00,631 --> 02:08:02,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't throw
people away.</font>

1552
02:08:06,011 --> 02:08:07,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">Show us his face!</font>

1553
02:08:24,822 --> 02:08:26,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell
is going on?</font>

1554
02:08:28,117 --> 02:08:29,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is the delay?</font>

1555
02:08:29,493 --> 02:08:31,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Confirm the identity
of your agent!</font>

1556
02:08:31,369 --> 02:08:32,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes!</font>

1557
02:08:33,456 --> 02:08:34,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's our man!</font>

1558
02:08:36,082 --> 02:08:37,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">She fucked them.</font>

1559
02:08:37,918 --> 02:08:39,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goodbye, Nate.</font>

1560
02:08:51,890 --> 02:08:53,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good morning.</font>

1561
02:08:54,601 --> 02:08:56,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, sit.</font>

1562
02:08:56,395 --> 02:08:57,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were right
about your niece.</font>

1563
02:08:57,979 --> 02:08:59,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">She did very well.</font>

1564
02:08:59,189 --> 02:09:03,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">She called from Budapest.
Gave us the name of the mole.</font>

1565
02:09:04,819 --> 02:09:06,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wonderful news.</font>

1566
02:09:06,488 --> 02:09:08,855
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I've had
a security detail</i></font>

1567
02:09:08,949 --> 02:09:10,815
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>search the mole's office.</i></font>

1568
02:09:10,993 --> 02:09:12,448
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>His apartment.</i></font>

1569
02:09:14,247 --> 02:09:18,286
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>The apartment
was covered in metka.</i></font>

1570
02:09:18,458 --> 02:09:20,416
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Attributed to Nash.</i></font>

1571
02:09:24,131 --> 02:09:26,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a statement...</font>

1572
02:09:26,801 --> 02:09:29,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">for an account opened
in a private bank in Vienna...</font>

1573
02:09:29,929 --> 02:09:33,137
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>into which the Americans
have recently made payments...</i></font>

1574
02:09:33,306 --> 02:09:36,550
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>of $250,000.</i></font>

1575
02:09:36,726 --> 02:09:38,967
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Sort of money
paid to a defector.</i></font>

1576
02:09:39,063 --> 02:09:41,850
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>The account is in your name
with your passport number.</i></font>

1577
02:09:42,024 --> 02:09:44,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I forgot my coat.
I'll get it.</font>

1578
02:09:46,988 --> 02:09:49,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">You recently made a trip
to Vienna, did you not?</font>

1579
02:09:49,990 --> 02:09:52,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know
this is my niece, right?</font>

1580
02:09:52,118 --> 02:09:53,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's angry with me.</font>

1581
02:09:53,286 --> 02:09:56,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is one of the disks
Boucher gave us.</font>

1582
02:09:56,956 --> 02:09:59,618
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>The disks you passed on
to the president.</i></font>

1583
02:09:59,708 --> 02:10:01,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your personal victory.</font>

1584
02:10:02,837 --> 02:10:05,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's supposed to have
come from the DOD.</font>

1585
02:10:05,922 --> 02:10:07,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">But at the request
of your niece,</font>

1586
02:10:07,632 --> 02:10:10,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">we examined it
more closely.</font>

1587
02:10:11,970 --> 02:10:14,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">The encryption signature
suggests</font>

1588
02:10:14,390 --> 02:10:16,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">it was written in Langley.</font>

1589
02:10:16,434 --> 02:10:17,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a fake.</font>

1590
02:10:20,354 --> 02:10:22,123
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>You are special.
You have a gift. Like me.</i></font>

1591
02:10:22,148 --> 02:10:23,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see through people.</font>

1592
02:10:23,606 --> 02:10:25,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see them
for what they really are.</font>

1593
02:10:26,027 --> 02:10:28,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you always
stay one step ahead.</font>

1594
02:10:31,614 --> 02:10:33,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great family I have.</font>

1595
02:10:47,631 --> 02:10:49,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">You killed me.</font>

1596
02:10:50,091 --> 02:10:52,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">Didn't I do well, Uncle?</font>

1597
02:11:12,280 --> 02:11:14,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">Target is in range.</font>

1598
02:13:15,654 --> 02:13:16,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello?</font>

1599
02:13:19,783 --> 02:13:21,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello?</font>
