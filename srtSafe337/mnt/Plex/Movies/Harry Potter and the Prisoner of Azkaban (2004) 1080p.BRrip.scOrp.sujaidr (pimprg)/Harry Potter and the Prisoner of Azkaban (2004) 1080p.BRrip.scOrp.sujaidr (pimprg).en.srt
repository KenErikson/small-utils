I need you to sign this form.</font>

11
00:01:57,768 --> 00:01:59,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it?</font>

12
00:01:59,269 --> 00:02:01,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing. School stuff.</font>

13
00:02:01,563 --> 00:02:04,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">Later perhaps, if you behave.</font>

14
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,609

15
00:02:06,777 --> 00:02:09,905

- Yes.</font>

16
00:02:10,322 --> 00:02:12,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't say yes
in that ungrateful way.</font>

17
00:02:13,115 --> 00:02:15,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn good of my brother
to keep you.</font>

18

21
00:02:26,254 --> 00:02:28,549

26
00:02:44,647 --> 00:02:46,650

33

<font color="#FFFFFF">St. Brutus'. It's a fine
institution for hopeless cases.</font>

34

at St. Brutus', boy?</font>

35
00:03:18,014 --> 00:03:19,348
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah.</font>

36
00:03:19,557 --> 00:03:22,227

37

namby-pamby...</font>

not beating people who deserve it.</font>

Bad blood will out.</font>

41
00:03:35,865 --> 00:03:38,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it the boy's father did,
Petunia?</font>

42
00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:41,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing. He didn't work.
He was unemployed.</font>

43
00:03:41,371 --> 00:03:44,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And a drunk too, no doubt?
- That's a lie.</font>

44
00:03:44,373 --> 00:03:46,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What did you say?
- My dad wasn't a drunk.</font>

45
00:03:49,921 --> 00:03:54,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry. Don't fuss, Petunia.
I have a very firm grip.</font>

46
00:03:54,175 --> 00:03:56,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think it's time you went to bed.</font>

47
00:03:56,177 --> 00:03:59,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quiet, Vernon. You, clean it up.</font>

48
00:04:00,806 --> 00:04:03,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, it's nothing to do
with the father.</font>

49
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:07,772
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all to do with the mother.
You see it all the time with dogs.</font>

50
00:04:07,939 --> 00:04:11,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">If something's wrong with the bitch,
then something's wrong with the pup.</font>

51
00:04:12,193 --> 00:04:13,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut up! Shut up!</font>

52
00:04:18,867 --> 00:04:20,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right.</font>

53
00:04:20,786 --> 00:04:22,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me tell you...</font>

54

56
00:05:34,776 --> 00:05:36,778

- Get off.</font>

59
00:05:48,624 --> 00:05:50,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Don't you dare!
- Sorry.</font>

60
00:05:51,627 --> 00:05:53,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Vernon.</font>

61
00:05:53,629 --> 00:05:55,379
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God.</font>

62
00:05:55,547 --> 00:05:57,341

00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:13,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come back!</font>

66
00:06:37,673 --> 00:06:40,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">You bring her back!
You bring her back now.</font>

67
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:43,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You put her right!
- No. She deserved what she got.</font>

68
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:47,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Keep away from me.
- You can't do magic outside school.</font>

69
00:06:47,307 --> 00:06:50,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah? Try me.
- They won't let you back now.</font>

70
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:51,812
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've nowhere to go.</font>

71
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:54,314

Anywhere is better than here.</font>

00:14:26,642 --> 00:14:29,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">And tomorrow you'll be
on your way back to Hogwarts.</font>

151
00:14:29,937 --> 00:14:32,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">These are your new schoolbooks.
I took the liberty...</font>

152
00:14:33,065 --> 00:14:37,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">of having them brought here.
Now Tom will show you to your room.</font>

153
00:14:41,865 --> 00:14:43,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hedwig.</font>

154
00:14:43,533 --> 00:14:48,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, by the way, Harry. Whilst you're
here, it would be best if you didn't...</font>

155
00:14:48,746 --> 00:14:51,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">wander.</font>

156
00:14:52,793 --> 00:14:55,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right! You gonna move
that bus or what?</font>

157
00:16:14,457 --> 00:16:16,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Housekeeping.</font>

158
00:16:19,922 --> 00:16:22,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll come back later.</font>

159
00:16:29,764 --> 00:16:31,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm warning you, Hermione.</font>

160
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:35,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep that beast away from Scabbers,
or I'll turn it into a tea cozy.</font>

161
00:16:35,229 --> 00:16:37,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a cat, Ronald.
What do you expect?</font>

162
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's in his nature.
- A cat? Is that what they told you?</font>

163
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:43,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Looks like a pig with hair.
- That's rich...</font>

164
00:16:43,361 --> 00:16:45,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">coming from the owner
of that smelly old shoe brush.</font>

165
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:48,491
<font color="#FFFFFF">Crookshanks, just ignore
the mean little boy.</font>

166
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry.</font>

167
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:52,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry.</font>

168
00:16:53,956 --> 00:16:57,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Egypt. What's it like?
- Brilliant. Loads of old stuff...</font>

169
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">like mummies, tombs,
even Scabbers enjoyed himself.</font>

170
00:17:00,796 --> 00:17:03,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Egyptians used to worship cats.
- Along with the dung beetle.</font>

171
00:17:04,132 --> 00:17:07,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Not flashing that clipping again?
- I haven't shown anyone.</font>

172
00:17:07,469 --> 00:17:09,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, not a soul.
Not unless you count Tom.</font>

173
00:17:10,055 --> 00:17:11,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The day maid.
- Night maid.</font>

174
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,767
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Cook.
- The bloke who fixed the toilet.</font>

175
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:15,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Harry.
- Mrs. Weasley.</font>

176
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Good to see you, dear.
- Good to see you.</font>

177
00:17:17,855 --> 00:17:19,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Got everything?
- Yes.</font>

178
00:17:19,355 --> 00:17:21,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes? All your books?
- It's all upstairs.</font>

179
00:17:21,692 --> 00:17:23,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Your clothes?
- Everything.</font>

180
00:17:23,277 --> 00:17:24,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Good boy.
- Thank you.</font>

181
00:17:24,862 --> 00:17:26,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Harry Potter.
- Mr. Weasley.</font>

182
00:17:26,904 --> 00:17:30,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Harry, wonder if I might have a word?
- Yeah, sure.</font>

183
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:33,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hermione.
- Good morning, Mr. Weasley.</font>

184
00:17:33,412 --> 00:17:37,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Looking forward to a new term?
- Yeah. It should be great.</font>

185
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:43,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry, some within the Ministry
would strongly discourage me...</font>

186
00:17:44,131 --> 00:17:46,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">from divulging what I'm about
to reveal to you.</font>

187
00:17:46,967 --> 00:17:50,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I think that you need
to know the facts.</font>

188
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:53,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are in danger.</font>

189
00:17:53,723 --> 00:17:56,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grave danger.</font>

190
00:17:56,684 --> 00:17:59,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">Has this anything to do
with Sirius Black, sir?</font>

191
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:02,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you know
about Sirius Black, Harry?</font>

192
00:18:02,691 --> 00:18:06,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.
- Do you know why?</font>

193
00:18:07,112 --> 00:18:09,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thirteen years ago,
when you stopped...</font>

194
00:18:10,073 --> 00:18:11,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Voldemort.
- Don't say his name.</font>

195
00:18:12,075 --> 00:18:13,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry.</font>

196
00:18:13,576 --> 00:18:16,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">When you stopped You-Know-Who...</font>

197
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:18,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Black lost everything.</font>

198
00:18:18,457 --> 00:18:22,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">But to this day, he still remains
a faithful servant.</font>

199
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">And in his mind...</font>

200
00:18:25,255 --> 00:18:28,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">you are the only thing
that stands in the way...</font>

201
00:18:28,424 --> 00:18:32,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">of You-Know-Who
returning to power.</font>

202
00:18:32,346 --> 00:18:34,513
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that is why...</font>

203
00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:37,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">he has escaped from Azkaban.</font>

204
00:18:37,558 --> 00:18:39,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">To find you.</font>

205
00:18:40,729 --> 00:18:42,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">And kill me.</font>

206
00:18:43,315 --> 00:18:45,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry, swear to me
that whatever you might hear...</font>

207
00:18:46,151 --> 00:18:48,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">you won't go looking for Black.</font>

208
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:50,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Weasley...</font>

209
00:18:50,572 --> 00:18:54,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">why would I go looking
for someone who wants to kill me?</font>

210
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:56,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quick. Quick.</font>

211
00:18:57,287 --> 00:18:59,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ron, Ron!</font>

212
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, for goodness' sake!</font>

213
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't lose him!</font>

214
00:19:05,628 --> 00:19:07,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't mean to blow her up. I just...</font>

215
00:19:07,881 --> 00:19:10,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I lost control.
- Brilliant.</font>

216
00:19:10,509 --> 00:19:14,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">Honestly, Ron, it's not funny.
Harry was lucky not to be expelled.</font>

217
00:19:14,262 --> 00:19:16,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was lucky not to be arrested.</font>

218
00:19:16,181 --> 00:19:18,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">I still think it was brilliant.</font>

219
00:19:18,808 --> 00:19:21,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on. Everywhere else is full.</font>

220
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who do you think that is?</font>

221
00:19:25,523 --> 00:19:28,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Professor R.J. Lupin.
- Do you know everything?</font>

222
00:19:28,568 --> 00:19:30,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">How is it she knows everything?</font>

223
00:19:30,863 --> 00:19:33,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's on his suitcase, Ronald.
- Oh.</font>

224
00:19:34,282 --> 00:19:37,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do you think he's really asleep?
- Seems to be. Why?</font>

225
00:19:39,288 --> 00:19:41,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">I gotta tell you something.</font>

226
00:19:54,635 --> 00:19:57,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me get this straight.
Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban...</font>

227
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">to come after you?
- Yeah.</font>

228
00:20:00,142 --> 00:20:02,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">But they'll catch Black, won't they?</font>

229
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:05,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I mean, everyone's looking for him.
- Sure.</font>

230
00:20:05,189 --> 00:20:08,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">Except no one's ever broken out
of Azkaban before...</font>

231
00:20:08,692 --> 00:20:12,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he's a murderous, raving lunatic.
- Thanks, Ron.</font>

232
00:20:14,155 --> 00:20:15,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are we stopping?</font>

233
00:20:16,825 --> 00:20:18,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't be there yet.</font>

234
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:25,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's going on?</font>

235
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.
Maybe we've broken down.</font>

236
00:20:29,837 --> 00:20:32,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ouch, Ron. That was my foot.</font>

237
00:20:33,049 --> 00:20:34,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's something moving out there.</font>

238
00:20:48,565 --> 00:20:51,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think someone's coming aboard.</font>

239
00:21:16,801 --> 00:21:19,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bloody hell! What's happening?</font>

240
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry.</font>

241
00:22:34,462 --> 00:22:36,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry, are you all right?</font>

242
00:22:42,471 --> 00:22:44,138
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

243
00:22:45,307 --> 00:22:47,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here, eat this. It'll help.</font>

244
00:22:48,268 --> 00:22:50,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all right. It's chocolate.</font>

245
00:22:56,692 --> 00:22:58,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">What was that thing that came?</font>

246
00:22:58,945 --> 00:23:02,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was a dementor. One of the guards
of Azkaban. It's gone now.</font>

247
00:23:02,532 --> 00:23:05,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was searching the train
for Sirius Black.</font>

248
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:09,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you'll excuse me, I need to have
a little word with the driver.</font>

249
00:23:13,626 --> 00:23:16,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eat. You'll feel better.</font>

250
00:23:22,344 --> 00:23:23,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened to me?</font>

251
00:23:23,845 --> 00:23:25,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you sort of went rigid.</font>

252
00:23:25,763 --> 00:23:28,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">We thought maybe you were
having a fit or something.</font>

253
00:23:30,685 --> 00:23:32,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">And did either of you two...</font>

254
00:23:32,645 --> 00:23:33,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">you know...</font>

255
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:37,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">pass out?
- No.</font>

256
00:23:37,401 --> 00:23:39,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">I felt weird, though.</font>

257
00:23:39,278 --> 00:23:41,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like I'd never be cheerful again.</font>

258
00:23:42,364 --> 00:23:44,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">But someone was screaming.</font>

259
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">A woman.</font>

260
00:23:47,076 --> 00:23:49,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one was screaming, Harry.</font>

261
00:24:48,262 --> 00:24:52,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome! Welcome to another year
at Hogwarts.</font>

262
00:24:52,226 --> 00:24:54,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, I'd like to say a few words...</font>

263
00:24:54,435 --> 00:24:58,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">before we all become too befuddled
by our excellent feast.</font>

264
00:24:58,941 --> 00:25:02,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">First, I'm pleased to welcome
Professor R.J. Lupin...</font>

265
00:25:02,402 --> 00:25:04,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">who's kindly consented
to fill the post...</font>

266
00:25:05,029 --> 00:25:07,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">of Defense Against
the Dark Arts teacher.</font>

267
00:25:07,657 --> 00:25:10,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good luck, professor.</font>

268
00:25:14,789 --> 00:25:18,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course. That's why he knew
to give you the chocolate, Harry.</font>

269
00:25:18,292 --> 00:25:20,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">Potter. Is it true you fainted?</font>

270
00:25:21,797 --> 00:25:24,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I mean, you actually fainted?
- Shove off, Malfoy.</font>

271
00:25:24,967 --> 00:25:26,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How did he find out?
- Just forget it.</font>

272
00:25:27,134 --> 00:25:29,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our Care of Magical Creatures
teacher...</font>

273
00:25:29,721 --> 00:25:31,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">has decided to retire...</font>

274
00:25:31,765 --> 00:25:35,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">in order to spend more time
with his remaining limbs.</font>

275
00:25:35,727 --> 00:25:38,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fortunately,
I'm delighted to announce...</font>

276
00:25:38,605 --> 00:25:41,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">that his place will be taken
by none other...</font>

277
00:25:41,607 --> 00:25:45,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">than our own Rubeus Hagrid.</font>

278
00:25:57,207 --> 00:26:00,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">Finally, on a more disquieting note...</font>

279
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:02,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">at the request
of the Ministry of Magic...</font>

280
00:26:02,921 --> 00:26:08,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hogwarts will, until further notice,
play host to the dementors of Azkaban...</font>

281
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:12,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">until such a time
as Sirius Black is captured.</font>

282
00:26:13,181 --> 00:26:16,852
<font color="#FFFFFF">The dementors will be stationed
at every entrance to the grounds.</font>

283
00:26:17,019 --> 00:26:18,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now whilst I've been assured...</font>

284
00:26:18,854 --> 00:26:22,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">that their presence will not disrupt
our day-to-day activities...</font>

285
00:26:22,691 --> 00:26:24,026
<font color="#FFFFFF">a word of caution.</font>

286
00:26:24,233 --> 00:26:27,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dementors are vicious creatures.
They'll not distinguish...</font>

287
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:30,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">between the one they hunt
and the one who gets in their way.</font>

288
00:26:31,157 --> 00:26:34,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">Therefore, I must warn
each and every one of you...</font>

289
00:26:34,952 --> 00:26:38,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">to give them no reason
to harm you.</font>

290
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:44,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is not in the nature
of a dementor to be forgiving.</font>

291
00:26:46,589 --> 00:26:49,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you know,
happiness can be found...</font>

292
00:26:50,051 --> 00:26:53,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">even in the darkest of times...</font>

293
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:58,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">if one only remembers
to turn on the light.</font>

294
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,782
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Fortuna Major.</i></font>

295
00:27:15,618 --> 00:27:18,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here, listen.
She just won't let me in.</font>

00:27:18,497 --> 00:27:21,415
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- Fortuna Major.
- No, no. Wait, wait.</i></font>

297
00:27:21,583 --> 00:27:23,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">Watch this.</font>

298
00:27:34,179 --> 00:27:39,142
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- Amazing. Just with my voice.
- Fortuna Major.</i></font>

299
00:27:39,351 --> 00:27:42,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yes, all right. Go in.
- Thank you.</font>

300
00:27:44,897 --> 00:27:46,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Still doing that after three years.</font>

301
00:27:47,067 --> 00:27:49,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">- She can't even sing.
- Exactly.</font>

302
00:27:50,444 --> 00:27:52,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey, man.
- Hey, man.</font>

303
00:27:53,656 --> 00:27:55,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, God.
- That's awful.</font>

304
00:27:55,992 --> 00:27:58,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">Green. That's a monkey.</font>

305
00:27:59,954 --> 00:28:02,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What is that?
- You call that a monkey?</font>

306
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:05,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do not give him one again.</font>

307
00:28:05,167 --> 00:28:07,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Neville, try an elephant.</font>

308
00:28:14,886 --> 00:28:16,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ron, catch.
- I will.</font>

309
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:23,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think we have a winner.</font>

310
00:28:24,896 --> 00:28:27,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, don't try one of them.
- Oh, no.</font>

311
00:28:27,857 --> 00:28:30,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at him. His face.</font>

312
00:29:13,987 --> 00:29:16,240
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Welcome, my children.</i></font>

313
00:29:16,448 --> 00:29:21,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">In this room, you shall explore
the noble art of Divination.</font>

314
00:29:21,702 --> 00:29:27,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">In this room, you shall discover
if you possess the Sight.</font>

315
00:29:28,417 --> 00:29:32,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello. I am Professor Trelawney.</font>

316
00:29:32,548 --> 00:29:37,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">Together we shall cast ourselves
into the future.</font>

317
00:29:37,385 --> 00:29:41,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">This term, we'll focus on Tasseomancy,
the art of reading tea leaves.</font>

318
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:44,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">So please, take the cup
of the person sitting opposite you.</font>

319
00:29:45,477 --> 00:29:46,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you see?</font>

320
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:52,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">The truth lies buried like a sentence
deep within a book, waiting to be read.</font>

321
00:29:52,901 --> 00:29:55,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">But first, you must broaden
your minds.</font>

322
00:29:55,487 --> 00:30:00,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">- First, you must look beyond.
- What a load of rubbish.</font>

323
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where did you come from?
- Me?</font>

324
00:30:02,286 --> 00:30:04,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I've been here all this time.
- You, boy...</font>

325
00:30:05,122 --> 00:30:07,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is your grandmother quite well?</font>

326
00:30:08,083 --> 00:30:09,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think so.</font>

327
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:12,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wouldn't be so sure of that.
Give me the cup.</font>

328
00:30:15,507 --> 00:30:16,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pity.</font>

329
00:30:17,092 --> 00:30:19,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Broaden your minds.</font>

330
00:30:23,307 --> 00:30:26,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your aura is pulsing, dear.
Are you in the beyond?</font>

331
00:30:26,809 --> 00:30:28,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I think you are.
- Sure.</font>

332
00:30:28,936 --> 00:30:31,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at the cup.
Tell me what you see.</font>

333
00:30:31,315 --> 00:30:33,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

334
00:30:33,858 --> 00:30:38,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry's got sort of a wonky cross.
That's trials and suffering.</font>

335
00:30:38,739 --> 00:30:42,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that there could be the sun
and that's happiness.</font>

336
00:30:42,576 --> 00:30:43,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">So...</font>

337
00:30:44,076 --> 00:30:48,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're gonna suffer,
but you're gonna be happy about it.</font>

338
00:30:48,332 --> 00:30:49,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me the cup.</font>

339
00:30:52,251 --> 00:30:54,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, my dear boy.</font>

340
00:30:56,214 --> 00:30:57,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">My dear...</font>

341
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:02,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">you have the Grim.</font>

342
00:31:03,471 --> 00:31:05,223
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Grin? What's the Grin?</font>

343
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:08,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not the Grin, you idiot. The Grim.</font>

344
00:31:08,434 --> 00:31:10,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Taking form of a giant spectral dog.</font>

345
00:31:10,811 --> 00:31:13,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's among the darkest omens
in our world.</font>

346
00:31:13,815 --> 00:31:15,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's an omen...</font>

347
00:31:15,651 --> 00:31:17,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">of death. "</font>

348
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:25,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't think that Grim thing's
got anything to do with Sirius Black?</font>

349
00:31:25,993 --> 00:31:29,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, honestly, Ron. If you ask me,
Divination's a woolly discipline.</font>

350
00:31:30,123 --> 00:31:33,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, Ancient Runes,
that's a fascinating subject.</font>

351
00:31:33,961 --> 00:31:37,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ancient Runes? Exactly how many
classes are you taking?</font>

352
00:31:37,256 --> 00:31:38,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">A fair few.</font>

353
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:41,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hang on. That's not possible.</font>

354
00:31:41,343 --> 00:31:44,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ancient Runes is in the
same time as Divination.</font>

355
00:31:44,304 --> 00:31:46,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have to be in two
classes at once.</font>

356
00:31:46,472 --> 00:31:49,852
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't be silly. How could anyone
be in two classes at once?</font>

357
00:31:50,018 --> 00:31:54,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Broaden your minds. Use your
Inner Eye to see the future. "</font>

358
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's it. Come on, now. Come closer.
Less talking, if you don't mind.</font>

359
00:31:59,569 --> 00:32:01,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got a real treat for you today.</font>

360
00:32:01,571 --> 00:32:03,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">A great lesson. So follow me.</font>

361
00:32:14,835 --> 00:32:17,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right, you lot. Less chattering.
Form a group over there.</font>

362
00:32:18,087 --> 00:32:20,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">And open your books to page 49.</font>

363
00:32:20,757 --> 00:32:22,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Exactly how do we do that?</font>

364
00:32:22,593 --> 00:32:26,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just stroke the spine, of course.
Goodness me.</font>

365
00:32:35,855 --> 00:32:39,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Don't be such a wimp, Longbottom.
- I'm okay. Okay.</font>

366
00:32:43,322 --> 00:32:46,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I think they're funny.
- Oh, yeah. Terribly funny.</font>

367
00:32:46,741 --> 00:32:49,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">Witty. God, this place
has gone to the dogs.</font>

368
00:32:49,411 --> 00:32:53,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's
got this oaf teaching classes.</font>

369
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut up, Malfoy.</font>

370
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:11,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dementor! Dementor!</font>

371
00:33:19,942 --> 00:33:23,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Just ignore him.
- You're supposed to stroke it.</font>

372
00:33:23,194 --> 00:33:24,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

373
00:33:34,873 --> 00:33:37,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Isn't he beautiful?</font>

374
00:33:38,042 --> 00:33:40,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say hello to Buckbeak.</font>

375
00:33:41,255 --> 00:33:43,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hagrid, exactly what is that?</font>

376
00:33:43,714 --> 00:33:45,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">That, Ron, is a hippogriff.</font>

377
00:33:45,925 --> 00:33:49,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">First thing you wanna know
is they're very proud creatures.</font>

378
00:33:49,637 --> 00:33:53,517
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very easily offended.
You do not want to insult a hippogriff.</font>

379
00:33:53,683 --> 00:33:56,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">It may be the last thing you ever do.</font>

380
00:33:56,603 --> 00:33:59,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, who'd like to come
and say hello?</font>

381
00:34:02,526 --> 00:34:04,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well done, Harry. Well done.</font>

382
00:34:07,405 --> 00:34:08,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on now.</font>

383
00:34:09,324 --> 00:34:10,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now...</font>

384
00:34:10,867 --> 00:34:14,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">you have to let him make the first
move. It's only polite. So...</font>

385
00:34:14,746 --> 00:34:16,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">step up. Give him a nice bow.</font>

386
00:34:16,831 --> 00:34:19,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then you wait
and see if he bows back.</font>

387
00:34:19,418 --> 00:34:21,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">If he does, you can go and touch him.</font>

388
00:34:21,711 --> 00:34:24,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">If not... Well,
we'll get to that later.</font>

389
00:34:27,592 --> 00:34:29,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just make your bow.</font>

390
00:34:31,221 --> 00:34:32,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice and low.</font>

391
00:34:38,228 --> 00:34:39,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">Back off, Harry. Back off.</font>

392
00:34:41,773 --> 00:34:43,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep still.</font>

393
00:34:44,943 --> 00:34:46,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep still.</font>

394
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:59,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well done, Harry. Well done.
Here, you big brute, you.</font>

395
00:35:02,043 --> 00:35:04,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right. I think you can go
and pat him now.</font>

396
00:35:04,795 --> 00:35:06,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on. Don't be shy.</font>

397
00:35:15,056 --> 00:35:17,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice and slow, now.
Nice and slow. Slow.</font>

398
00:35:20,853 --> 00:35:22,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not so fast, Harry.</font>

399
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">Slow down, Harry. That's it...</font>

400
00:35:30,822 --> 00:35:33,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice and slow.
Now let him come to you.</font>

401
00:35:35,869 --> 00:35:38,204
<font color="#FFFFFF">Slowly, now, slowly, slowly...</font>

402
00:35:38,413 --> 00:35:40,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's it...</font>

403
00:35:40,831 --> 00:35:42,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes!</font>

404
00:35:42,751 --> 00:35:46,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well done! Well done, Harry,
well done!</font>

405
00:35:46,338 --> 00:35:48,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does he get to fly?</font>

406
00:35:48,548 --> 00:35:50,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I think he may let you ride him now.
- What?</font>

407
00:35:51,134 --> 00:35:52,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Come on.
- Hey, hey, hey!</font>

408
00:35:52,844 --> 00:35:56,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put you over here,
just behind the wing joint.</font>

409
00:35:56,681 --> 00:36:01,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't pull out any of his feathers,
because he won't thank you for that.</font>

410
00:37:41,994 --> 00:37:45,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well done, Harry, and well done,
Buckbeak.</font>

411
00:37:45,706 --> 00:37:47,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was wicked, Harry!</font>

412
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:49,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, please.</font>

413
00:37:50,003 --> 00:37:52,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well done, well done.</font>

414
00:37:53,005 --> 00:37:56,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How am I doing me first day?
- Brilliant, professor.</font>

415
00:37:59,637 --> 00:38:03,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not dangerous at all, are you,
you great ugly brute!</font>

416
00:38:04,059 --> 00:38:05,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">Malfoy, no...</font>

417
00:38:06,353 --> 00:38:07,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

418
00:38:08,521 --> 00:38:10,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">Buckbeak!</font>

419
00:38:10,356 --> 00:38:12,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa, whoa, whoa...</font>

420
00:38:13,652 --> 00:38:15,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoa! Buckbeak!</font>

421
00:38:16,572 --> 00:38:18,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">Away, you silly creature...</font>

422
00:38:19,115 --> 00:38:22,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's killed me!
- Calm down. It's just a scratch!</font>

423
00:38:22,411 --> 00:38:23,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hagrid!</font>

424
00:38:23,786 --> 00:38:29,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He has to be taken to the hospital.
- I'm the teacher. I'll do it.</font>

425
00:38:32,045 --> 00:38:34,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're gonna regret this.
- Class dismissed!</font>

426
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:37,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">You and your bloody chicken!</font>

427
00:39:00,865 --> 00:39:02,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does it hurt terribly, Draco?</font>

428
00:39:03,117 --> 00:39:06,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">It comes and it goes.
Still, I consider myself lucky.</font>

429
00:39:07,121 --> 00:39:10,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">Madam Pomfrey said another minute
and I could've lost my arm.</font>

430
00:39:10,791 --> 00:39:13,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I can't do homework for weeks.
- Listen to the idiot.</font>

431
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:18,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?
- At least Hagrid didn't get fired.</font>

432
00:39:18,382 --> 00:39:22,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hear Draco's father's furious.
We haven't heard the end of this.</font>

433
00:39:22,304 --> 00:39:24,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He's been sighted!
- Who?</font>

434
00:39:24,347 --> 00:39:26,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sirius Black!</font>

435
00:39:27,099 --> 00:39:30,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dufftown? That's not far from here.</font>

436
00:39:30,521 --> 00:39:33,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't think he'd come
to Hogwarts, do you?</font>

437
00:39:33,315 --> 00:39:35,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">- With dementors at every entrance?
- Dementors?</font>

438
00:39:35,983 --> 00:39:39,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">He slipped past them once.
Who's to say he won't do it again?</font>

439
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:44,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right. Black could be anywhere.
It's like trying to catch smoke.</font>

440
00:39:44,867 --> 00:39:48,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like trying to catch smoke
with your bare hands.</font>

441
00:40:14,146 --> 00:40:16,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">Intriguing, isn't it?</font>

442
00:40:19,485 --> 00:40:22,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would anyone like to venture
a guess...</font>

443
00:40:22,405 --> 00:40:24,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">as to what is inside?</font>

444
00:40:24,407 --> 00:40:28,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's a boggart, that is.
- Very good, Mr. Thomas.</font>

445
00:40:29,161 --> 00:40:32,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, can anybody tell me
what a boggart looks like?</font>

446
00:40:32,291 --> 00:40:34,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No one knows.
- When did she get here?</font>

447
00:40:34,543 --> 00:40:36,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boggarts are shape-shifters.</font>

448
00:40:36,253 --> 00:40:39,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">They take the shape of whatever
a person fears the most.</font>

449
00:40:39,672 --> 00:40:44,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's what makes them so...
- So terrifying, yes, yes, yes...</font>

450
00:40:44,302 --> 00:40:49,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Luckily, a very simple charm exists
to repel a boggart.</font>

451
00:40:51,143 --> 00:40:54,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's practice it now.
Without wands, please.</font>

452
00:40:55,188 --> 00:40:57,690
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>After me. Riddikulus!</i></font>

453
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,027
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- Riddikulus!
- Very good.</i></font>

454
00:41:00,235 --> 00:41:02,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">A little louder and very clear.</font>

455
00:41:02,945 --> 00:41:05,157
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- Riddikulus!
- Riddikulus!</i></font>

456
00:41:05,364 --> 00:41:07,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This class is ridiculous.
- Very good.</font>

457
00:41:07,659 --> 00:41:11,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">So much for the easy part. You see,
the incantation alone is not enough.</font>

458
00:41:11,871 --> 00:41:15,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">What really finishes a boggart
is laughter.</font>

459
00:41:15,791 --> 00:41:20,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need to force it to assume
a shape you find truly amusing.</font>

460
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:24,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me explain. Neville,
would you join me, please?</font>

461
00:41:24,717 --> 00:41:27,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, don't be shy. Come on.</font>

462
00:41:28,054 --> 00:41:29,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

463
00:41:30,181 --> 00:41:33,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello. Neville, what frightens you
most of all?</font>

464
00:41:33,893 --> 00:41:35,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Snape.</font>

465
00:41:35,771 --> 00:41:37,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sorry?
- Professor Snape.</font>

466
00:41:37,773 --> 00:41:41,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Snape. Yes, frightens all.</font>

467
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:45,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You live with your grandmother.
- I don't want it to turn into her, either.</font>

468
00:41:46,364 --> 00:41:47,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">No...</font>

469
00:41:48,784 --> 00:41:51,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">it won't. I want you
to picture her clothes.</font>

470
00:41:51,827 --> 00:41:55,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only her clothes, very clearly,
in your mind.</font>

471
00:41:55,248 --> 00:41:58,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">- She carries a red handbag...
- We don't need to hear.</font>

472
00:41:58,501 --> 00:42:02,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">As long as you see it, we'll see it.
Now, when I open that wardrobe...</font>

473
00:42:02,588 --> 00:42:05,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">here's what I want
you to do. Excuse me.</font>

474
00:42:06,342 --> 00:42:09,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">Imagine Professor Snape
in your grandmother's clothes.</font>

475
00:42:09,471 --> 00:42:11,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you do that?</font>

476
00:42:11,764 --> 00:42:14,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. Wand at the ready.</font>

477
00:42:14,809 --> 00:42:18,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">One, two, three.</font>

478
00:42:28,114 --> 00:42:29,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Think, Neville, think.</font>

479
00:42:32,744 --> 00:42:34,788
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Riddikulus!</i></font>

480
00:42:39,333 --> 00:42:42,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wonderful, Neville, wonderful!
Incredible! Okay...</font>

481
00:42:42,211 --> 00:42:45,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">to the back, Neville.
Everyone, form a line...</font>

482
00:42:51,346 --> 00:42:52,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">Form a line!</font>

483
00:42:52,847 --> 00:42:56,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want everyone to picture the thing
they fear the very most...</font>

484
00:42:56,476 --> 00:42:59,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">and turn it into something funny.</font>

485
00:42:59,771 --> 00:43:01,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">Next! Ron!</font>

486
00:43:04,693 --> 00:43:08,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">Concentrate. Face your fear.
Be brave!</font>

487
00:43:19,708 --> 00:43:21,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wand at the ready, Ron.</font>

488
00:43:22,001 --> 00:43:23,836
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Riddikulus!</i></font>

489
00:43:24,003 --> 00:43:25,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes!</font>

490
00:43:25,963 --> 00:43:28,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see? Very good, very good!</font>

491
00:43:29,342 --> 00:43:35,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">Marvelous! Absolutely, very, very
enjoyable! Parvati! Next!</font>

492
00:43:36,974 --> 00:43:39,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">Show us what you see.</font>

493
00:43:48,445 --> 00:43:51,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep your nerve. Steady.</font>

494
00:43:52,032 --> 00:43:53,992
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Riddikulus!</i></font>

495
00:43:55,034 --> 00:43:56,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">And next! Step up, step up!</font>

496
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wonderful, wonderful!</font>

497
00:44:13,929 --> 00:44:16,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here!</font>

498
00:44:21,894 --> 00:44:23,730
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Riddikulus!</i></font>

499
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:35,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right. Sorry about that.
That's enough for today.</font>

500
00:44:35,324 --> 00:44:37,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">Collect your books from the back.</font>

501
00:44:37,494 --> 00:44:40,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the end of the lesson.
Thank you! Sorry!</font>

502
00:44:40,289 --> 00:44:43,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, you can have too much
of a good thing.</font>

503
00:44:45,335 --> 00:44:49,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember, these visits to Hogsmeade
village are a privilege.</font>

504
00:44:50,215 --> 00:44:53,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should your behavior reflect poorly
on the school...</font>

505
00:44:53,217 --> 00:44:56,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">that privilege shall not
be extended again.</font>

506
00:44:56,597 --> 00:44:59,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">No permission form signed,
no visiting the village.</font>

507
00:45:00,057 --> 00:45:01,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the rule, Potter.</font>

508
00:45:01,809 --> 00:45:05,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those with permission, follow me.
Those without, stay put.</font>

509
00:45:05,188 --> 00:45:07,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought if you signed it,
then I could...</font>

510
00:45:07,858 --> 00:45:10,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't. Only a parent
or a guardian can sign.</font>

511
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:13,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Since I am neither,
it would be inappropriate.</font>

512
00:45:16,032 --> 00:45:20,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, Potter.
That's my final word.</font>

513
00:45:21,829 --> 00:45:25,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forget about it, guys. See you later.</font>

514
00:45:38,889 --> 00:45:40,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor, can I ask you something?</font>

515
00:45:41,141 --> 00:45:44,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to know why I stopped you
facing that boggart, yes?</font>

516
00:45:45,186 --> 00:45:46,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought it'd be obvious.</font>

517
00:45:46,771 --> 00:45:49,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">I assumed it would take the shape
of Lord Voldemort.</font>

518
00:45:49,775 --> 00:45:53,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did think of Voldemort at first.</font>

519
00:45:53,487 --> 00:45:56,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">But then I remembered that night
on the train...</font>

520
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">and the dementor.
- I'm very impressed.</font>

521
00:45:58,992 --> 00:46:01,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">That suggests what you fear the most
is fear itself.</font>

522
00:46:02,036 --> 00:46:03,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is very wise.</font>

523
00:46:03,704 --> 00:46:05,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">Before I fainted...</font>

524
00:46:06,041 --> 00:46:08,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard something.</font>

525
00:46:08,585 --> 00:46:10,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">A woman...</font>

526
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:12,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">screaming.</font>

527
00:46:12,213 --> 00:46:15,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dementors force us to relive
our very worst memories.</font>

528
00:46:15,675 --> 00:46:18,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our pain becomes their power.</font>

529
00:46:19,429 --> 00:46:21,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think it was my mother...</font>

530
00:46:21,806 --> 00:46:24,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">the night she was murdered.</font>

531
00:46:25,643 --> 00:46:30,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">The very first time I saw you, Harry,
I recognized you immediately.</font>

532
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:33,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not by your scar, by your eyes.</font>

533
00:46:33,943 --> 00:46:36,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're your mother, Lily's.</font>

534
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:38,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

535
00:46:38,824 --> 00:46:41,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yes. I knew her.</font>

536
00:46:44,161 --> 00:46:48,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your mother was there for me
at a time when no one else was.</font>

537
00:46:48,208 --> 00:46:51,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not only was she
a singularly gifted witch...</font>

538
00:46:51,586 --> 00:46:54,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">she was also
an uncommonly kind woman.</font>

539
00:46:55,423 --> 00:46:58,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">She had a way of seeing
the beauty in others...</font>

540
00:46:58,677 --> 00:47:03,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">even, and most especially, when that
person could not see it in themselves.</font>

541
00:47:06,309 --> 00:47:09,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">And your father, James,
on the other hand...</font>

542
00:47:09,188 --> 00:47:10,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">he...</font>

543
00:47:11,231 --> 00:47:14,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">He had a certain, shall we say,
talent for trouble.</font>

544
00:47:16,862 --> 00:47:22,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">A talent, rumor has it,
he passed on to you.</font>

545
00:47:26,371 --> 00:47:29,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're more like them
than you know, Harry.</font>

546
00:47:30,166 --> 00:47:33,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">In time, you'll come to see
just how much.</font>

547
00:47:36,757 --> 00:47:41,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant,
but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop.</font>

548
00:47:41,344 --> 00:47:43,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">We never got to go
to the Shrieking Shack.</font>

549
00:47:44,056 --> 00:47:48,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You heard it's the most...
- Haunted building in Britain. I know.</font>

550
00:47:49,478 --> 00:47:50,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's going on?</font>

551
00:47:51,146 --> 00:47:53,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">Probably Neville forgot
the password again.</font>

552
00:47:53,773 --> 00:47:56,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey.
- Oh, you're there.</font>

553
00:47:56,360 --> 00:48:00,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me through, please.
Excuse me! I'm Head Boy!</font>

554
00:48:02,282 --> 00:48:03,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get back, all of you.</font>

555
00:48:04,117 --> 00:48:07,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one is to enter this dormitory
until it's been searched.</font>

556
00:48:07,454 --> 00:48:08,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Fat Lady! She's gone!</font>

557
00:48:10,873 --> 00:48:13,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">Serves her right.
She was a terrible singer.</font>

558
00:48:13,501 --> 00:48:15,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not funny, Ron.</font>

559
00:48:17,422 --> 00:48:21,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep calm, everyone. Break into fours.
Back to your common room.</font>

560
00:48:27,849 --> 00:48:28,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Be quiet.
- Make way.</font>

561
00:48:29,101 --> 00:48:31,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The headmaster's here.
- Come on, move.</font>

562
00:48:31,269 --> 00:48:33,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">You heard. Move!</font>

563
00:48:47,369 --> 00:48:50,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Filch? Round up the ghosts.</font>

564
00:48:50,581 --> 00:48:54,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell them to search every painting
in the castle to find the Fat Lady.</font>

565
00:48:54,876 --> 00:48:57,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no need for ghosts, professor.</font>

566
00:48:58,797 --> 00:49:00,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Fat Lady's there.</font>

567
00:49:01,757 --> 00:49:03,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mind where you're going! Slow down!</font>

568
00:49:04,344 --> 00:49:07,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">You listen! I'm Head Boy!</font>

569
00:49:07,181 --> 00:49:09,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Come back here!
- Keep moving!</font>

570
00:49:13,186 --> 00:49:16,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dear lady, who did this to you?</font>

571
00:49:17,983 --> 00:49:23,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eyes like the devil, he's got,
and a soul as dark as his name.</font>

572
00:49:23,947 --> 00:49:26,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's him, headmaster.
The one they all talk about.</font>

573
00:49:27,117 --> 00:49:29,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's here, somewhere in the castle!</font>

574
00:49:29,827 --> 00:49:31,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sirius Black!</font>

575
00:49:32,206 --> 00:49:37,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">Secure the castle, Mr. Filch.
The rest of you, to the Great Hall.</font>

576
00:50:05,405 --> 00:50:10,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've searched the Astronomy Tower
and the Owlery. There's nothing there.</font>

577
00:50:10,494 --> 00:50:13,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thank you.
- The third floor's clear too, sir.</font>

578
00:50:13,246 --> 00:50:15,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Very good.
- I've done the dungeons.</font>

579
00:50:15,373 --> 00:50:18,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">No sign of Black, nor anywhere else
in the castle.</font>

580
00:50:18,251 --> 00:50:20,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't really expect him to linger.</font>

581
00:50:22,005 --> 00:50:24,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remarkable feat, don't you think?</font>

582
00:50:24,507 --> 00:50:26,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">To enter Hogwarts Castle
on one's own...</font>

583
00:50:26,969 --> 00:50:29,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">completely undetected?
- Quite remarkable, yes.</font>

584
00:50:29,847 --> 00:50:31,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any theories on how he managed it?</font>

585
00:50:31,889 --> 00:50:34,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">Many. Each as unlikely as the next.</font>

586
00:50:35,101 --> 00:50:36,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">You may recall...</font>

587
00:50:36,811 --> 00:50:39,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">prior to the start of term
I expressed concerns...</font>

588
00:50:39,815 --> 00:50:41,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">about your appointment
of Professor...</font>

589
00:50:42,067 --> 00:50:46,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not a single professor inside this castle
would help Sirius Black enter it.</font>

590
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:48,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm quite convinced
the castle is safe...</font>

591
00:50:48,907 --> 00:50:52,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'm more than willing to send
the students to their houses.</font>

592
00:50:52,702 --> 00:50:55,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about Potter?
Should he be warned?</font>

593
00:50:55,246 --> 00:50:57,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps. But for now, let him sleep.</font>

594
00:50:58,750 --> 00:51:03,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">For in dreams, we enter a world
that's entirely our own.</font>

595
00:51:03,755 --> 00:51:08,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let them swim in the deepest ocean
or glide over the highest cloud.</font>

596
00:51:47,590 --> 00:51:50,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">Turn to page 394.</font>

597
00:52:00,353 --> 00:52:03,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me, sir.
Where's Professor Lupin?</font>

598
00:52:04,650 --> 00:52:08,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not really your concern,
is it, Potter?</font>

599
00:52:08,237 --> 00:52:12,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">Suffice it to say your professor
finds himself incapable of teaching...</font>

600
00:52:12,324 --> 00:52:17,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">at the present time.
Turn to page 394.</font>

601
00:52:22,208 --> 00:52:23,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Werewolves"?</font>

602
00:52:24,210 --> 00:52:26,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir, we just learned about red caps
and hinkypunks.</font>

603
00:52:27,213 --> 00:52:30,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We're not meant to start that for weeks.
- Quiet.</font>

604
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:33,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">When did she come in?
Did you see her come in?</font>

605
00:52:34,346 --> 00:52:37,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, which one of you
can tell me the difference...</font>

606
00:52:38,057 --> 00:52:40,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">between an Animagus
and a werewolf?</font>

607
00:52:41,186 --> 00:52:43,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one?</font>

608
00:52:43,605 --> 00:52:46,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How disappointing.
- Please, sir.</font>

609
00:52:46,733 --> 00:52:49,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">An Animagus is a wizard
who elects to turn into an animal.</font>

610
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:51,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">A werewolf has no choice.</font>

611
00:52:52,030 --> 00:52:53,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">With each full moon...</font>

612
00:52:53,907 --> 00:52:57,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">he no longer remembers who he is.
He'd kill his best friend.</font>

613
00:52:57,994 --> 00:53:01,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">The werewolf only responds
to the call of its own kind.</font>

614
00:53:02,748 --> 00:53:05,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, Mr. Malfoy.
That's the second time...</font>

615
00:53:05,668 --> 00:53:08,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">you've spoken out of turn,
Miss Granger.</font>

616
00:53:08,170 --> 00:53:10,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you incapable
of restraining yourself...</font>

617
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:13,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">or do you take pride
in being an insufferable know-it-all?</font>

618
00:53:13,969 --> 00:53:17,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He's got a point, you know.
- Five points from Gryffindor.</font>

619
00:53:17,597 --> 00:53:22,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">As an antidote to your ignorance,
and on my desk, by Monday morning...</font>

620
00:53:22,393 --> 00:53:26,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">two rolls of parchment
on the werewolf, with emphasis...</font>

621
00:53:26,273 --> 00:53:28,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">on recognizing it.
- It's Quidditch tomorrow.</font>

622
00:53:29,943 --> 00:53:33,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I suggest you take extra care,
Mr. Potter.</font>

623
00:53:33,487 --> 00:53:37,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">Loss of limb will not excuse you.</font>

624
00:53:37,742 --> 00:53:41,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">Page 394.</font>

625
00:53:43,498 --> 00:53:44,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">The term "werewolf"...</font>

626
00:53:45,876 --> 00:53:50,380
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>is a contraction
of the Anglo-Saxon word "wer"...</i></font>

627
00:53:51,130 --> 00:53:55,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">which means "man, " and "wolf. "
Werewolf, man-wolf.</font>

628
00:53:56,219 --> 00:53:58,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are several ways
to become a werewolf.</font>

629
00:53:58,764 --> 00:54:01,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">They include being given the power
of shape-shifting...</font>

630
00:54:02,016 --> 00:54:03,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">being bitten by a werewolf...</font>

631
00:54:22,746 --> 00:54:26,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go, Harry! Go, Harry!</font>

632
00:56:26,161 --> 00:56:28,996
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Aresto momentum!</i></font>

633
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:34,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?
- Peaky?</font>

634
00:56:34,545 --> 00:56:36,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you expect?
He fell over 100 feet.</font>

635
00:56:37,005 --> 00:56:39,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's walk you off a tower
and see what you look like.</font>

636
00:56:40,092 --> 00:56:43,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">Probably a right sight better
than he normally does.</font>

637
00:56:46,806 --> 00:56:49,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How are you feeling?
- Oh, brilliant.</font>

638
00:56:49,976 --> 00:56:51,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">You gave us a right good scare.</font>

639
00:56:52,186 --> 00:56:55,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What happened?
- Well, you fell off your broom.</font>

640
00:56:55,983 --> 00:56:58,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really? I meant the match. Who won?</font>

641
00:57:02,739 --> 00:57:04,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one blames you, Harry.</font>

642
00:57:04,657 --> 00:57:08,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dementors aren't supposed to be
on the grounds. Dumbledore's furious.</font>

643
00:57:08,704 --> 00:57:10,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">After he saved you,
he sent them off.</font>

644
00:57:10,956 --> 00:57:14,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's something else
you should know too.</font>

645
00:57:15,168 --> 00:57:20,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">When you fell, your broom sort of blew
into the Whomping Willow, and...</font>

646
00:57:22,009 --> 00:57:23,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well...</font>

647
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:27,054
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I'm sorry to hear
about your broomstick.</i></font>

648
00:57:27,389 --> 00:57:30,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is there no chance of fixing it?</font>

649
00:57:30,184 --> 00:57:31,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

650
00:57:31,726 --> 00:57:35,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor, why do the dementors
affect me so?</font>

651
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:38,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I mean, more than everyone else?
- Listen.</font>

652
00:57:38,733 --> 00:57:41,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dementors are the foulest creatures
to walk this earth.</font>

653
00:57:42,112 --> 00:57:46,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">They feed on every good feeling,
every happy memory...</font>

654
00:57:46,909 --> 00:57:51,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">until a person is left with absolutely
nothing but his worst experiences.</font>

655
00:57:51,704 --> 00:57:55,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are not weak, Harry.</font>

656
00:57:56,083 --> 00:58:00,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dementors affect you most because
there are true horrors in your past.</font>

657
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:03,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">Horrors your classmates
can scarcely imagine.</font>

658
00:58:03,925 --> 00:58:06,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have nothing to be ashamed of.</font>

659
00:58:06,427 --> 00:58:10,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm scared, professor.
- I'd consider you a fool if you weren't.</font>

660
00:58:10,641 --> 00:58:14,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to know how to fight them.
You could teach me.</font>

661
00:58:14,311 --> 00:58:16,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">You made the one
on the train go away.</font>

662
00:58:16,521 --> 00:58:18,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">There was only one that night.</font>

663
00:58:18,565 --> 00:58:23,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But you made it go away.
- I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry.</font>

664
00:58:23,487 --> 00:58:28,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">But as the dementors seem
to have developed an interest in you...</font>

665
00:58:28,617 --> 00:58:32,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">perhaps I should teach you.
But after the holidays.</font>

666
00:58:32,454 --> 00:58:34,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">For now, I need to rest.</font>

667
00:58:59,815 --> 00:59:04,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Last call for Hogsmeade!
Come on, now!</font>

668
00:59:19,710 --> 00:59:21,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Guys, let me go.
- Clever, Harry.</font>

669
00:59:21,878 --> 00:59:24,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But not clever enough.
- We've got a better way.</font>

670
00:59:24,965 --> 00:59:27,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.
- We know.</font>

671
00:59:27,967 --> 00:59:29,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll get you there.</font>

672
00:59:29,344 --> 00:59:32,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We'll show you a quicker way.
- If you pipe down.</font>

673
00:59:32,222 --> 00:59:35,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Bless him.
- Let me go! Come on, guys. Don't...</font>

674
00:59:36,434 --> 00:59:39,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Now, Harry.
- Come and join the big boys.</font>

675
00:59:40,438 --> 00:59:42,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

676
00:59:42,815 --> 00:59:45,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's this rubbish?
- "What's this rubbish?" he says.</font>

677
00:59:45,818 --> 00:59:49,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's the secret to our success.
- It's a wrench giving it to you...</font>

678
00:59:49,322 --> 00:59:52,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we've decided
your needs are greater than ours.</font>

679
00:59:52,409 --> 00:59:54,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">George, if you will.</font>

680
00:59:54,327 --> 00:59:57,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">I solemnly swear
that I am up to no good.</font>

681
01:00:01,251 --> 01:00:04,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail,
Padfoot and Prongs...</font>

682
01:00:05,255 --> 01:00:08,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">are proud to present
the Marauder's Map. "</font>

683
01:00:08,467 --> 01:00:10,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">We owe them so much.</font>

684
01:00:14,264 --> 01:00:18,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hang on. This is Hogwarts.
And that...</font>

685
01:00:18,268 --> 01:00:20,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No. Is that really...?
- Dumbledore.</font>

686
01:00:20,896 --> 01:00:22,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">- In his study.
- Pacing.</font>

687
01:00:22,396 --> 01:00:24,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does that a lot.</font>

688
01:00:24,565 --> 01:00:26,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So this map shows...
- Everyone.</font>

689
01:00:26,610 --> 01:00:28,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where they are.
- What they're doing.</font>

690
01:00:28,778 --> 01:00:29,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Every minute.
- Every day.</font>

691
01:00:30,072 --> 01:00:33,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Brilliant! Where did you get it?
- From Filch's office.</font>

692
01:00:33,242 --> 01:00:35,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">- First year.
- There are seven secret passageways...</font>

693
01:00:36,161 --> 01:00:38,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">out of the castle.
- We'd recommend this one.</font>

694
01:00:38,996 --> 01:00:42,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The One-Eyed Witch passageway.
- Leads you to Honeyduke's.</font>

695
01:00:42,333 --> 01:00:44,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hurry. Filch is heading this way.</font>

696
01:00:44,335 --> 01:00:47,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">And don't forget. When you're done,
just give it a tap and say:</font>

697
01:00:47,922 --> 01:00:52,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Mischief managed. "
Otherwise, anyone can read it.</font>

698
01:01:27,588 --> 01:01:29,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, how much do you want?</font>

699
01:01:37,097 --> 01:01:39,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">Delicious.</font>

700
01:01:47,023 --> 01:01:51,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's meant to be the most haunted
building in Britain. Did I mention that?</font>

701
01:01:51,277 --> 01:01:52,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">Twice.</font>

702
01:01:53,655 --> 01:01:55,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you want to move a bit closer?</font>

703
01:01:56,199 --> 01:01:57,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">To the Shrieking Shack?</font>

704
01:01:58,202 --> 01:02:01,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, I'm fine here.</font>

705
01:02:01,246 --> 01:02:03,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, well. Look who's here.</font>

706
01:02:03,456 --> 01:02:05,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">You two shopping for your new
dream home?</font>

707
01:02:05,958 --> 01:02:10,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee?
Don't your family sleep in one room?</font>

708
01:02:10,463 --> 01:02:13,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Shut your mouth, Malfoy.
- Not very friendly.</font>

709
01:02:13,967 --> 01:02:19,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boys, I think it's time we teach
Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors.</font>

710
01:02:19,306 --> 01:02:22,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hope you don't mean yourself.
- How dare you talk to me!</font>

711
01:02:22,893 --> 01:02:24,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">You filthy little mudblood!</font>

712
01:02:29,106 --> 01:02:30,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who is that?</font>

713
01:02:36,864 --> 01:02:39,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Don't stand there! Do something!
- What?</font>

714
01:02:59,054 --> 01:03:01,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's up, Malfoy? Lost your skis?</font>

715
01:03:05,309 --> 01:03:06,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out of the way!</font>

716
01:03:06,894 --> 01:03:08,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">Move!</font>

717
01:03:08,981 --> 01:03:11,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">Malfoy! Wait! Wait!</font>

718
01:03:15,737 --> 01:03:17,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry!</font>

719
01:03:17,864 --> 01:03:21,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bloody hell, Harry.
That was not funny.</font>

720
01:03:23,077 --> 01:03:26,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those weasels! Never told me
about any Marauder's Map.</font>

721
01:03:26,539 --> 01:03:29,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">He won't keep it. He'll turn it over
to Professor McGonagall.</font>

722
01:03:30,210 --> 01:03:34,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Aren't you?
- Sure. Along with his Invisibility Cloak.</font>

723
01:03:34,338 --> 01:03:36,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look who it is. Madam Rosmerta.</font>

724
01:03:37,050 --> 01:03:39,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ron fancies her.
- That's not true!</font>

725
01:03:39,510 --> 01:03:41,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Professor McGonagall!
- Cornelius!</font>

726
01:03:41,554 --> 01:03:42,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">Allow me, minister.</font>

727
01:03:43,139 --> 01:03:44,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, Hagrid...
- Sorry about that.</font>

728
01:03:45,184 --> 01:03:48,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rosmerta, my dear.
I hope business is good.</font>

729
01:03:48,311 --> 01:03:52,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">It'd be a lot better if the Ministry
wasn't sending dementors...</font>

730
01:03:52,356 --> 01:03:56,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">into my pub every other night!
- We have...</font>

731
01:03:56,820 --> 01:04:00,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We have a killer on the loose.
- Sirius Black in Hogsmeade!</font>

732
01:04:00,364 --> 01:04:02,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what would bring him here?</font>

733
01:04:02,992 --> 01:04:07,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Harry Potter.
- Harry Potter?</font>

734
01:04:07,331 --> 01:04:09,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come.</font>

735
01:04:11,626 --> 01:04:13,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry!</font>

736
01:04:21,344 --> 01:04:25,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No underage wizards allowed in today!
- Shut the damn door!</font>

737
01:04:26,016 --> 01:04:28,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So rude.
- Thick heads.</font>

738
01:04:28,268 --> 01:04:29,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thick heads?
- How dare they!</font>

739
01:04:30,061 --> 01:04:33,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who are they calling thick heads?
- Young whippersnappers!</font>

740
01:04:33,981 --> 01:04:37,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody will come to a pub where
they'll get scared out of their wits.</font>

741
01:04:38,070 --> 01:04:41,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Dumbledore doesn't want
dementors around the place.</font>

742
01:04:44,784 --> 01:04:46,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me what this is all about.</font>

743
01:04:46,744 --> 01:04:51,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">Years ago, when Harry Potter's parents
realized they were marked for death...</font>

744
01:04:51,375 --> 01:04:54,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember? They hid.
Few knew where they were.</font>

745
01:04:54,253 --> 01:04:58,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">One who did was Sirius Black.
And he told You-Know-Who.</font>

746
01:04:58,297 --> 01:05:01,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not only did Black lead him
to the Potters that night...</font>

747
01:05:01,677 --> 01:05:05,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">he also killed Peter Pettigrew!</font>

748
01:05:05,304 --> 01:05:07,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.</font>

749
01:05:07,641 --> 01:05:09,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Always trailing after Black.
- I remember.</font>

750
01:05:10,059 --> 01:05:11,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never let James and Sirius
out of his sight.</font>

751
01:05:12,061 --> 01:05:14,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What happened?
- Peter tried to warn the Potters...</font>

752
01:05:14,981 --> 01:05:19,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">and might have, had he not
run into an old friend, Sirius Black.</font>

753
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:23,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">Black was vicious.
He didn't kill Pettigrew.</font>

754
01:05:23,407 --> 01:05:25,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">He destroyed him!</font>

755
01:05:26,201 --> 01:05:30,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">A finger. That's all that was left.
A finger. Nothing else.</font>

756
01:05:31,123 --> 01:05:34,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sirius Black may not have
put his hands to the Potters...</font>

757
01:05:34,333 --> 01:05:37,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">but he's the reason they're dead.
- He wants to finish things.</font>

758
01:05:37,753 --> 01:05:40,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I don't believe it.
- That's not the worst of it.</font>

759
01:05:40,798 --> 01:05:44,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What could be worse?
- This: Sirius Black was...</font>

760
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:46,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">and remains to this day...</font>

761
01:05:47,347 --> 01:05:48,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry Potter's godfather!</font>

762
01:05:57,608 --> 01:05:59,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ron, look!</font>

763
01:06:05,615 --> 01:06:08,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sorry. Excuse me, excuse me.
- Merry Christmas.</font>

764
01:06:46,657 --> 01:06:48,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry, what happened?</font>

765
01:06:50,994 --> 01:06:53,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was their friend...</font>

766
01:06:53,621 --> 01:06:55,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he betrayed them.</font>

767
01:06:56,666 --> 01:06:58,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was their friend!</font>

768
01:07:00,878 --> 01:07:02,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope he finds me.</font>

769
01:07:03,465 --> 01:07:05,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because when he does,
I'm gonna be ready!</font>

770
01:07:06,260 --> 01:07:08,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">When he does, I'm gonna kill him!</font>

771
01:07:23,150 --> 01:07:24,777
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Harry.</i></font>

772
01:07:25,278 --> 01:07:26,947
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>There you are. You came.</i></font>

773
01:07:27,322 --> 01:07:31,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you sure about this, Harry?
This is very advanced magic...</font>

774
01:07:31,367 --> 01:07:33,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">well beyond the Ordinary
Wizarding Level.</font>

775
01:07:33,996 --> 01:07:35,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure.</font>

776
01:07:36,123 --> 01:07:38,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, everything's prepared.</font>

777
01:07:38,833 --> 01:07:42,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">The spell I'm going to teach you
is called the Patronus Charm.</font>

778
01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:43,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you ever hear of it?</font>

779
01:07:44,047 --> 01:07:45,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">No? Well...</font>

780
01:07:45,882 --> 01:07:49,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">A Patronus is a positive force.
For the wizard who conjures one...</font>

781
01:07:49,635 --> 01:07:54,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">it works like a shield, with the
dementor feeding on it rather than him.</font>

782
01:07:54,474 --> 01:07:58,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">But in order for it to work,
you need to think of a memory.</font>

783
01:07:58,478 --> 01:08:02,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not just any memory, a very happy
memory, a very powerful memory.</font>

784
01:08:02,648 --> 01:08:06,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you do this?
Yes. Very well.</font>

785
01:08:07,653 --> 01:08:09,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">Close your eyes.</font>

786
01:08:11,657 --> 01:08:13,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">Concentrate.</font>

787
01:08:14,786 --> 01:08:16,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">Explore your past.</font>

788
01:08:17,372 --> 01:08:19,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you have a memory?</font>

789
01:08:20,833 --> 01:08:23,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">Allow it to fill you up.</font>

790
01:08:23,753 --> 01:08:25,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lose yourself within it.</font>

791
01:08:26,172 --> 01:08:31,511
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Then speak the incantation,
Expecto Patronum.</i></font>

792
01:08:31,929 --> 01:08:34,765
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- Expecto Patronum.
- Very good.</i></font>

793
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:41,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shall we? Wand at the ready.</font>

794
01:08:59,413 --> 01:09:02,333
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Expecto Patronum!</i></font>

795
01:09:02,792 --> 01:09:06,462
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Expecto... Expecto...</i></font>

796
01:09:06,712 --> 01:09:08,422
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Expect...</i></font>

797
01:09:10,425 --> 01:09:14,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here we go. Come on.
Sit up. Deep breaths.</font>

798
01:09:14,805 --> 01:09:18,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all right. I didn't expect you
to do it the first time.</font>

799
01:09:19,016 --> 01:09:24,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">That would have been remarkable.
Here, eat this. You'll feel better.</font>

800
01:09:24,981 --> 01:09:27,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's one nasty dementor.
- Oh, no, no, no.</font>

801
01:09:28,068 --> 01:09:30,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was a boggart, Harry.
A boggart.</font>

802
01:09:30,988 --> 01:09:34,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">The real thing would be worse.
Much, much worse.</font>

803
01:09:34,323 --> 01:09:36,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">As a matter of interest,
what were you thinking?</font>

804
01:09:37,118 --> 01:09:40,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Which memory did you choose?
- The first time I rode a broom.</font>

805
01:09:42,039 --> 01:09:45,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not good enough.
Not nearly good enough.</font>

806
01:09:52,259 --> 01:09:57,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's another.
It's not happy, exactly.</font>

807
01:09:59,432 --> 01:10:01,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it is.</font>

808
01:10:01,726 --> 01:10:04,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the happiest I've ever felt...</font>

809
01:10:04,479 --> 01:10:08,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it's complicated.
- Is it strong?</font>

810
01:10:12,820 --> 01:10:15,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then let's give it a try. You feel ready?</font>

811
01:10:17,451 --> 01:10:19,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just do it.</font>

812
01:10:29,253 --> 01:10:32,507
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Expecto Patronum!</i></font>

813
01:10:33,759 --> 01:10:37,720
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Expecto Patronum!</i></font>

814
01:10:59,326 --> 01:11:00,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes!</font>

815
01:11:02,371 --> 01:11:05,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well done, Harry. Well done!</font>

816
01:11:06,332 --> 01:11:10,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I think I've had enough for today.
- Yes. Sit down. Here.</font>

817
01:11:10,628 --> 01:11:13,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eat this, it helps. It really helps.</font>

818
01:11:13,215 --> 01:11:15,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">And just so you know, Harry...</font>

819
01:11:15,175 --> 01:11:19,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you'd have given your father
a run for his money. And that...</font>

820
01:11:19,345 --> 01:11:21,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">is saying something.</font>

821
01:11:23,559 --> 01:11:25,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was thinking of him.</font>

822
01:11:25,726 --> 01:11:27,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Mum.</font>

823
01:11:28,063 --> 01:11:30,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seeing their faces.</font>

824
01:11:30,940 --> 01:11:33,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">They were talking to me.</font>

825
01:11:33,819 --> 01:11:36,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just talking.</font>

826
01:11:36,238 --> 01:11:38,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the memory I chose.</font>

827
01:11:40,199 --> 01:11:42,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't even know if it's real.</font>

828
01:11:43,161 --> 01:11:45,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it's the best I have.</font>

829
01:11:54,547 --> 01:11:56,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Beautiful day.
- Gorgeous.</font>

830
01:11:57,050 --> 01:11:59,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unless you've been ripped to pieces!</font>

831
01:11:59,219 --> 01:12:01,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ripped to pieces?
What are you talking about?</font>

832
01:12:01,805 --> 01:12:04,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ronald has lost his rat.
- I haven't lost anything!</font>

833
01:12:05,141 --> 01:12:07,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Your cat killed him!
- Rubbish.</font>

834
01:12:07,435 --> 01:12:10,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry, you've seen the way
that bloodthirsty beast of hers...</font>

835
01:12:10,939 --> 01:12:14,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">is always lurking about.
And Scabbers is gone.</font>

836
01:12:15,027 --> 01:12:17,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, maybe you should
take better care of your pets!</font>

837
01:12:18,070 --> 01:12:20,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Your cat killed him!
- Did not.</font>

838
01:12:20,323 --> 01:12:21,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Did.
- Didn't.</font>

839
01:12:23,868 --> 01:12:26,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did it go, Hagrid? The hearing?</font>

840
01:12:26,662 --> 01:12:29,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, first off, the committee members
took turns...</font>

841
01:12:30,125 --> 01:12:32,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">talking about why we were there.</font>

842
01:12:34,671 --> 01:12:37,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got up and did my piece.
Said how Buckbeak...</font>

843
01:12:37,507 --> 01:12:40,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">was a good hippogriff,
always cleaned his feathers.</font>

844
01:12:40,676 --> 01:12:43,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then Lucius Malfoy got up.
Well, you can imagine.</font>

845
01:12:43,889 --> 01:12:47,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said Buckbeak was a deadly
and dangerous creature...</font>

846
01:12:47,266 --> 01:12:50,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">who would kill you
as soon as look at you.</font>

847
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:52,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then?</font>

848
01:12:53,023 --> 01:12:55,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then he asked for the worst,
did old Lucius.</font>

849
01:12:55,900 --> 01:13:00,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">- They're not sacking you!
- No, I'm not sacked.</font>

850
01:13:02,114 --> 01:13:05,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!</font>

851
01:13:31,895 --> 01:13:37,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">Spiders! There's... There's spiders.
Spiders. They want me to tap-dance.</font>

852
01:13:37,734 --> 01:13:40,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I don't wanna tap-dance!
- Tell those spiders.</font>

853
01:13:40,487 --> 01:13:44,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right, yeah. Tell them. I'll tell them...</font>

854
01:14:02,592 --> 01:14:04,761
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.</i></font>

855
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:08,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Always trailing after Sirius Black.
- Black was vicious.</font>

856
01:14:08,265 --> 01:14:10,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">He didn't kill Pettigrew,
he destroyed him!</font>

857
01:14:18,817 --> 01:14:22,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Put that light out!
- Sorry.</font>

858
01:15:05,530 --> 01:15:09,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Watch it there, boy.
- We're trying to sleep here!</font>

859
01:15:17,876 --> 01:15:20,462
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Mischief managed. Nox.</i></font>

860
01:15:22,672 --> 01:15:24,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">Potter.</font>

861
01:15:24,173 --> 01:15:27,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing
wandering the corridors at night?</font>

862
01:15:27,845 --> 01:15:29,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was sleepwalking.</font>

863
01:15:29,179 --> 01:15:31,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">How extraordinarily like your father
you are, Potter.</font>

864
01:15:31,890 --> 01:15:36,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">He, too, was exceedingly arrogant,
strutting about the castle.</font>

865
01:15:36,854 --> 01:15:41,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">My dad didn't strut. And nor do I.</font>

866
01:15:41,942 --> 01:15:45,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you don't mind, I would appreciate
it if you could lower your wand.</font>

867
01:15:48,657 --> 01:15:50,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">Turn out your pockets.</font>

868
01:15:52,159 --> 01:15:54,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">Turn out your pockets!</font>

869
01:15:57,707 --> 01:15:59,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's this?</font>

870
01:15:59,501 --> 01:16:02,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Spare bit of parchment.
- Really? Open it.</font>

871
01:16:09,261 --> 01:16:13,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">Reveal your secrets.</font>

872
01:16:16,810 --> 01:16:18,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Read it.</font>

and Prongs...</font>

01:16:26,403 --> 01:16:30,532

to Professor Snape and... "</font>

875
01:16:30,823 --> 01:16:32,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on.</font>

876
01:16:33,493 --> 01:16:37,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">"And request he keep his large nose
out of other people's business. "</font>

877
01:16:37,581 --> 01:16:40,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You insolent little...
- Professor!</font>

878
01:16:41,752 --> 01:16:44,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, well. Lupin.</font>

879
01:16:44,630 --> 01:16:49,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">Out for a little walk
in the moonlight, are we?</font>

880
01:16:50,719 --> 01:16:53,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry, are you all right?</font>

881
01:16:53,346 --> 01:16:55,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">That remains to be seen.</font>

882
01:16:56,641 --> 01:17:00,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have now just confiscated
a rather curious artifact.</font>

883
01:17:00,561 --> 01:17:04,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take a look, Lupin.
Supposed to be your area of expertise.</font>

884
01:17:04,274 --> 01:17:09,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Clearly, it's full of dark magic.
- I seriously doubt it, Severus.</font>

885
01:17:09,238 --> 01:17:12,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">It looks as though it's a parchment
designed to insult anyone...</font>

886
01:17:12,908 --> 01:17:16,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">who tries to read it.
I suspect it's a Zonko product.</font>

887
01:17:16,953 --> 01:17:21,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nevertheless, I shall investigate
any hidden qualities it may possess.</font>

888
01:17:21,375 --> 01:17:24,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is, after all, as you say,
my area of expertise.</font>

889
01:17:24,670 --> 01:17:28,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry, would you come with me,
please? Professor, good night.</font>

890
01:17:34,011 --> 01:17:36,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you deaf? Put that light out!</font>

891
01:17:41,854 --> 01:17:43,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come in.</font>

892
01:17:45,106 --> 01:17:50,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">I haven't the faintest idea how this map
came to be in your possession...</font>

893
01:17:50,487 --> 01:17:54,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">but quite frankly, I am astounded
that you didn't hand it in.</font>

894
01:17:55,158 --> 01:17:58,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did it never occur to you that this,
in the hands of Sirius Black...</font>

895
01:17:58,996 --> 01:18:00,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">is a map to you?</font>

896
01:18:01,832 --> 01:18:04,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- No, sir.</font>

897
01:18:06,295 --> 01:18:09,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your father never set much store
by the rules either.</font>

898
01:18:09,506 --> 01:18:13,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">But he and your mother
gave their lives to save yours.</font>

899
01:18:14,469 --> 01:18:18,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gambling their sacrifice
by wandering the castle unprotected...</font>

900
01:18:18,724 --> 01:18:23,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">with a killer on the loose
seems to me a poor way to repay them!</font>

901
01:18:23,395 --> 01:18:25,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, I will not cover up for you again.</font>

902
01:18:25,730 --> 01:18:28,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do you hear me?
- Yes, sir.</font>

903
01:18:28,358 --> 01:18:32,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to return to your dormitory
and stay there.</font>

904
01:18:32,195 --> 01:18:36,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">And don't take any detours.
If you do, I shall know.</font>

905
01:18:41,622 --> 01:18:46,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor, just so you know,
I don't think that map always works.</font>

906
01:18:46,918 --> 01:18:51,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">Earlier, it showed someone in the castle.
Someone I know to be dead.</font>

907
01:18:52,298 --> 01:18:55,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, really? And who might that be?</font>

908
01:18:55,219 --> 01:18:56,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peter Pettigrew.</font>

909
01:18:59,389 --> 01:19:01,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not possible.</font>

910
01:19:02,684 --> 01:19:04,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just what I saw.</font>

911
01:19:07,189 --> 01:19:08,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good night, professor.</font>

912
01:19:12,402 --> 01:19:16,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">Broaden your minds.
You must look beyond.</font>

913
01:19:16,739 --> 01:19:22,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">The art of crystal gazing
is in the clearing of the Inner Eye.</font>

914
01:19:22,328 --> 01:19:25,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only then can you see. Try again.</font>

915
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:28,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, what do we have here?</font>

916
01:19:30,628 --> 01:19:32,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you mind me trying?</font>

917
01:19:35,259 --> 01:19:38,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Grim, possibly.</font>

918
01:19:40,389 --> 01:19:44,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">My dear, from the first moment
you stepped foot in my class...</font>

919
01:19:44,643 --> 01:19:48,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">I sensed that you did not possess
the proper spirit...</font>

920
01:19:48,604 --> 01:19:52,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">for the noble art of Divination.
No, you see, there.</font>

921
01:19:52,693 --> 01:19:56,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">You may be young in years,
but your heart is as shriveled...</font>

922
01:19:56,529 --> 01:20:00,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">as an old maid's, your soul
as dry as the pages of the books...</font>

923
01:20:00,701 --> 01:20:03,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">to which you so desperately cleave.</font>

924
01:20:19,344 --> 01:20:21,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have I said something?</font>

925
01:20:26,018 --> 01:20:30,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's gone mental, Hermione has.
Not that she wasn't always mental...</font>

926
01:20:31,189 --> 01:20:33,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">but now it's in the open
for everyone to see.</font>

927
01:20:33,942 --> 01:20:36,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hang on.</font>

928
01:20:36,319 --> 01:20:39,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We better take this back.
- I'm not going back.</font>

929
01:20:39,530 --> 01:20:42,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Fine. See you later.
- See you.</font>

930
01:21:20,697 --> 01:21:25,993
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Harry Potter...</i></font>

931
01:21:32,876 --> 01:21:37,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Professor Trelawney...
- He will return tonight.</font>

932
01:21:37,296 --> 01:21:38,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry?</font>

933
01:21:39,131 --> 01:21:43,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tonight, he who betrayed his friends,
whose heart rots with murder...</font>

934
01:21:43,929 --> 01:21:45,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">shall break free.</font>

935
01:21:46,139 --> 01:21:48,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Innocent blood shall be spilt...</font>

936
01:21:48,559 --> 01:21:53,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">and servant and master
shall be reunited once more.</font>

937
01:22:00,904 --> 01:22:04,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm so sorry, dear boy.
Did you say something?</font>

938
01:22:04,949 --> 01:22:06,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

939
01:22:07,202 --> 01:22:08,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing.</font>

940
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:05,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't believe they're going to kill
Buckbeak. It's just too horrible.</font>

941
01:23:05,551 --> 01:23:08,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It just got worse.
- What did I say? Father said...</font>

942
01:23:08,471 --> 01:23:12,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can keep the hippogriff's head.
I'll donate it to the Gryffindors' room.</font>

943
01:23:12,809 --> 01:23:15,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is going to be rich.</font>

944
01:23:15,479 --> 01:23:17,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Look who's here.
- Come to see the show?</font>

945
01:23:17,814 --> 01:23:20,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">You! You foul, loathsome,
evil little cockroach!</font>

946
01:23:21,109 --> 01:23:22,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hermione, no!</font>

947
01:23:23,444 --> 01:23:25,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not worth it.</font>

948
01:23:39,795 --> 01:23:41,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Malfoy, are you okay?</font>

949
01:23:42,046 --> 01:23:46,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let's go. Quick.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?</font>

950
01:23:46,426 --> 01:23:50,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.</font>

951
01:24:10,283 --> 01:24:14,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at him. Loves the smell of the trees
when the wind blows through them.</font>

952
01:24:14,746 --> 01:24:17,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't we just set him free?</font>

953
01:24:17,207 --> 01:24:19,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'd know it was me,
and then Dumbledore...</font>

954
01:24:19,792 --> 01:24:22,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">would get into trouble.
He's coming down, Dumbledore.</font>

955
01:24:22,962 --> 01:24:25,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Says he wants to be with me
when they...</font>

956
01:24:26,341 --> 01:24:28,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">When it happens.</font>

957
01:24:28,551 --> 01:24:29,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great man, Dumbledore.</font>

958
01:24:30,887 --> 01:24:32,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">A great man.</font>

959
01:24:34,891 --> 01:24:37,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We'll stay with you too.
- You'll do no such thing!</font>

960
01:24:38,060 --> 01:24:41,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Think I want you seeing
something like that? No.</font>

961
01:24:41,398 --> 01:24:45,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just drink your tea and be off.
Oh. Before you do, Ron...</font>

962
01:24:52,493 --> 01:24:54,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Scabbers! You're alive!</font>

963
01:24:55,037 --> 01:24:58,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- I think you owe someone an apology.</font>

964
01:24:58,916 --> 01:25:02,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right. Next time I see Crookshanks,
I'll let him know.</font>

965
01:25:02,836 --> 01:25:03,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">I meant me!</font>

966
01:25:04,630 --> 01:25:06,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blimey. What was that?</font>

967
01:25:13,305 --> 01:25:14,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hagrid!</font>

968
01:25:16,641 --> 01:25:17,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, crikey.</font>

969
01:25:19,435 --> 01:25:22,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, minister. Over this way.</font>

970
01:25:22,396 --> 01:25:26,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's late. It's nearly dark.
You shouldn't be here.</font>

971
01:25:26,652 --> 01:25:30,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone sees you outside
this time of night, you'll be in trouble.</font>

972
01:25:30,613 --> 01:25:34,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">Particularly you, Harry.
With you in a moment!</font>

973
01:25:35,618 --> 01:25:37,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quick. Quick!</font>

974
01:25:38,204 --> 01:25:39,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hagrid.</font>

975
01:25:40,122 --> 01:25:44,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It'll be fine. It'll be okay.
- Go on, go on!</font>

976
01:25:45,878 --> 01:25:48,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That's ling you see over there...
- On the slope.</font>

977
01:25:48,841 --> 01:25:51,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">- On the slope... Ah, Hagrid.
- Professor Dumbledore.</font>

978
01:25:51,676 --> 01:25:54,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Good evening.
- Minister. Make your way through.</font>

979
01:25:54,595 --> 01:25:58,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Have a tea, if you like.
- No, Hagrid.</font>

980
01:26:00,519 --> 01:26:03,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Gentlemen.
- I'd like a cup of tea.</font>

981
01:26:03,313 --> 01:26:06,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I think we should get down
to our business, shall we?</font>

982
01:26:07,818 --> 01:26:11,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very well. It is the decision
of the Committee for the Disposal...</font>

983
01:26:11,572 --> 01:26:14,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">of Dangerous Creatures
that the hippogriff Buckbeak...</font>

984
01:26:14,908 --> 01:26:20,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">hereinafter called "the condemned,"
shall be executed this day at sundown.</font>

985
01:26:20,581 --> 01:26:24,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Dear, dear...
- Now, now, Hagrid. Now, come on.</font>

986
01:26:24,333 --> 01:26:28,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">- All right. It'll be all right.
- The execution shall dispatch...</font>

987
01:26:28,881 --> 01:26:30,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

988
01:26:30,798 --> 01:26:32,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought I just saw...</font>

989
01:26:33,051 --> 01:26:35,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Never mind.
- Let's go!</font>

990
01:26:40,266 --> 01:26:42,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Buckbeak didn't mean no harm.</font>

991
01:27:29,106 --> 01:27:30,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no.</font>

992
01:27:41,494 --> 01:27:43,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">He bit me. Scabbers.</font>

993
01:27:44,288 --> 01:27:46,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ron. Ron!</font>

994
01:27:47,208 --> 01:27:50,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ron!
- Scabbers, come back.</font>

995
01:27:52,256 --> 01:27:53,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait!</font>

996
01:27:59,930 --> 01:28:04,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Scabbers, you bit me!
- Harry, you do realize what tree this is?</font>

997
01:28:04,393 --> 01:28:06,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not good. Ron, run!</font>

998
01:28:09,814 --> 01:28:12,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry, Hermione, run!</font>

999
01:28:12,943 --> 01:28:14,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the Grim!</font>

1000
01:28:21,577 --> 01:28:24,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Harry!
- Ron! Ron, wait!</font>

1001
01:28:24,829 --> 01:28:26,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry!</font>

1002
01:28:28,417 --> 01:28:30,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Help!
- Ron!</font>

1003
01:28:32,921 --> 01:28:36,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ron. Ron.
- Ron!</font>

1004
01:28:51,023 --> 01:28:52,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on!</font>

1005
01:28:54,943 --> 01:28:56,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Move!</font>

1006
01:29:00,407 --> 01:29:02,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">Duck!</font>

1007
01:29:38,028 --> 01:29:40,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry!</font>

1008
01:29:56,212 --> 01:29:59,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.</font>

1009
01:29:59,382 --> 01:30:03,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where do you suppose this goes?
- I have a hunch.</font>

1010
01:30:03,845 --> 01:30:05,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just hope I'm wrong.</font>

1011
01:30:25,033 --> 01:30:28,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're in the Shrieking Shack,
aren't we?</font>

1012
01:30:29,287 --> 01:30:30,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

1013
01:30:41,257 --> 01:30:42,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ron.</font>

1014
01:30:43,217 --> 01:30:45,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ron. You're okay.
- The dog. Where is it?</font>

1015
01:30:46,054 --> 01:30:49,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a trap. He's the dog.
He's an Animagus.</font>

1016
01:31:03,154 --> 01:31:05,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you want to kill Harry,
you have to kill us too!</font>

1017
01:31:06,115 --> 01:31:07,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Only one will die tonight.</font>

1018
01:31:08,118 --> 01:31:09,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then it'll be you!</font>

1019
01:31:16,251 --> 01:31:18,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you going to kill me, Harry?</font>

1020
01:31:19,630 --> 01:31:21,422
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Expelliarmus!</i></font>

1021
01:31:25,176 --> 01:31:29,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, well, Sirius.
Looking rather ragged, aren't we?</font>

1022
01:31:29,555 --> 01:31:32,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Finally, the flesh
reflects the madness within.</font>

1023
01:31:33,185 --> 01:31:36,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you'd know all about
the madness within, wouldn't you?</font>

1024
01:31:47,240 --> 01:31:48,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I found him.
- I know.</font>

1025
01:31:48,449 --> 01:31:49,701
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's him.
- I understand.</font>

1026
01:31:49,909 --> 01:31:53,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let's kill him!
- No! I trusted you!</font>

1027
01:31:53,538 --> 01:31:57,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">And all this time,
you've been his friend.</font>

1028
01:31:58,001 --> 01:32:01,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a werewolf!
That's why he's been missing classes.</font>

1029
01:32:03,841 --> 01:32:05,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long have you known?</font>

1030
01:32:06,051 --> 01:32:09,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Since Professor Snape set the essay.
- Well, Hermione.</font>

1031
01:32:09,470 --> 01:32:12,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are the brightest witch
of your age I've ever met.</font>

1032
01:32:12,557 --> 01:32:14,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enough talk, Remus!
Come on, let's kill him!</font>

1033
01:32:15,185 --> 01:32:17,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Wait!
- I did my waiting!</font>

1034
01:32:17,979 --> 01:32:20,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">Twelve years of it!</font>

1035
01:32:21,024 --> 01:32:23,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">In Azkaban!</font>

1036
01:32:32,869 --> 01:32:34,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very well. Kill him.</font>

1037
01:32:35,204 --> 01:32:38,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">But wait one more minute.
Harry has the right to know why.</font>

1038
01:32:39,126 --> 01:32:40,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know why.</font>

1039
01:32:40,918 --> 01:32:43,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">You betrayed my parents.</font>

1040
01:32:43,337 --> 01:32:46,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're the reason they're dead!
- No, it wasn't him.</font>

1041
01:32:46,425 --> 01:32:48,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somebody did betray your parents...</font>

1042
01:32:48,510 --> 01:32:52,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">somebody who, until quite recently,
I believed to be dead!</font>

1043
01:32:52,221 --> 01:32:55,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who was it, then?
- Peter Pettigrew!</font>

1044
01:32:55,850 --> 01:32:58,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he's in this room! Right now!</font>

1045
01:32:59,479 --> 01:33:02,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come out, come out, Peter!</font>

1046
01:33:02,608 --> 01:33:05,610
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- Come out, come out and play!
- Expelliarmus!</i></font>

1047
01:33:08,572 --> 01:33:11,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">Vengeance is sweet.</font>

1048
01:33:11,240 --> 01:33:13,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">How I hoped I'd be the one
to catch you.</font>

1049
01:33:13,659 --> 01:33:14,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">Severus...</font>

1050
01:33:15,162 --> 01:33:19,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told Dumbledore you were helping a
friend into the castle. Here's the proof.</font>

1051
01:33:20,082 --> 01:33:21,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brilliant, Snape.</font>

1052
01:33:21,585 --> 01:33:25,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've put your keen mind to the task
and come to the wrong conclusion.</font>

1053
01:33:26,172 --> 01:33:28,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you'll excuse us,
Remus and I have business...</font>

1054
01:33:29,009 --> 01:33:33,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">to attend to.
- Give me a reason. I beg you!</font>

1055
01:33:34,180 --> 01:33:36,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Don't be a fool.
- He can't help it. It's habit.</font>

1056
01:33:36,975 --> 01:33:38,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Be quiet.
- Be quiet yourself!</font>

1057
01:33:38,726 --> 01:33:41,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">You two, quarrelling
like an old married couple.</font>

1058
01:33:41,313 --> 01:33:43,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">Run along and play with
your chemistry set!</font>

1059
01:33:44,399 --> 01:33:46,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could do it, you know.</font>

1060
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:52,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">But why deny the dementors?
They're so longing to see you.</font>

1061
01:33:53,158 --> 01:33:55,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do I detect a flicker of fear?
Oh, yes.</font>

1062
01:33:56,036 --> 01:33:59,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">A Dementor's Kiss. One can only
imagine what that must be like.</font>

1063
01:33:59,706 --> 01:34:05,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's said to be nearly unbearable
to witness, but I'll do my best.</font>

1064
01:34:05,337 --> 01:34:07,547
<font color="#FFFFFF">Severus, please.</font>

1065
01:34:08,631 --> 01:34:10,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">After you.</font>

1066
01:34:15,055 --> 01:34:16,765
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Expelliarmus!</i></font>

1067
01:34:18,559 --> 01:34:22,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Harry! What did you just do?
- You attacked a teacher!</font>

1068
01:34:22,354 --> 01:34:24,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Tell me about Peter.
- He was at school with us.</font>

1069
01:34:25,106 --> 01:34:26,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">We thought he was our friend!</font>

1070
01:34:26,942 --> 01:34:29,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No. Pettigrew's dead. You killed him!
- No, he didn't.</font>

1071
01:34:30,112 --> 01:34:33,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought so too, until you mentioned
Pettigrew on the map!</font>

1072
01:34:33,532 --> 01:34:36,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The map was lying, then.
- The map never lies!</font>

1073
01:34:36,493 --> 01:34:40,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pettigrew's alive!
And he's right there!</font>

1074
01:34:40,956 --> 01:34:45,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Me? He's mental!
- Not you! Your rat!</font>

1075
01:34:45,836 --> 01:34:48,921
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Scabbers has been in my family for...
- Twelve years?</font>

1076
01:34:49,131 --> 01:34:51,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">Curiously long life
for a common garden rat!</font>

1077
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:54,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He's missing a toe, isn't he?
- So what?</font>

1078
01:34:54,552 --> 01:34:57,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">- All they could find of
Pettigrew was his... - Finger!</font>

1079
01:34:57,722 --> 01:35:00,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dirty coward cut it off
so everyone would think he was dead!</font>

1080
01:35:01,143 --> 01:35:04,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And then he transformed into a rat!
- Show me.</font>

1081
01:35:06,773 --> 01:35:09,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Give it to him, Ron.
- What are you trying to do to him?</font>

1082
01:35:10,027 --> 01:35:11,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Scabbers!</font>

1083
01:35:11,278 --> 01:35:14,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leave him alone! Get off him!
What are you doing?</font>

1084
01:35:36,845 --> 01:35:38,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remus?</font>

1085
01:35:39,430 --> 01:35:40,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sirius.</font>

1086
01:35:41,099 --> 01:35:42,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">My old friends!</font>

1087
01:35:48,649 --> 01:35:52,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry! Look at you.
You look so much like your father.</font>

1088
01:35:52,653 --> 01:35:56,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">- James. We were the best of friends...
- How dare you speak to Harry!</font>

1089
01:35:57,157 --> 01:35:59,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">How dare you talk about James
in front of him!</font>

1090
01:35:59,993 --> 01:36:05,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You sold James and Lily to Voldemort!
- I didn't mean to!</font>

1091
01:36:05,373 --> 01:36:08,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Dark Lord. You have no idea
the weapons he possesses!</font>

1092
01:36:08,417 --> 01:36:11,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ask yourself, Sirius!
What would you have done?</font>

1093
01:36:11,421 --> 01:36:17,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What would you have done?
- Died, rather than betray my friends!</font>

1094
01:36:19,179 --> 01:36:21,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">James wouldn't have wanted
me killed!</font>

1095
01:36:21,765 --> 01:36:27,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your dad would have spared me!
He would have shown me mercy!</font>

1096
01:36:27,938 --> 01:36:32,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">Should have realized if Voldemort
didn't kill you, we would. Together!</font>

1097
01:36:32,317 --> 01:36:34,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

1098
01:36:35,863 --> 01:36:39,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Harry, this man...
- I know what he is.</font>

1099
01:36:39,992 --> 01:36:41,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we'll take him to the castle.</font>

1100
01:36:42,077 --> 01:36:47,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Bless you, boy. Bless you!
- Get off!</font>

1101
01:36:48,292 --> 01:36:50,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">I said we'd take you to the castle.</font>

1102
01:36:51,043 --> 01:36:53,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">After that,
the dementors can have you.</font>

1103
01:36:57,176 --> 01:37:00,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry about the bite.
I reckon that twinges a bit.</font>

1104
01:37:01,095 --> 01:37:04,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">A bit? A bit?
You almost tore my leg off!</font>

1105
01:37:04,807 --> 01:37:06,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was going for the rat.</font>

1106
01:37:06,518 --> 01:37:10,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">Normally, I have a very sweet
disposition as a dog.</font>

1107
01:37:10,521 --> 01:37:15,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">More than once, James suggested
that I make the change permanent.</font>

1108
01:37:15,944 --> 01:37:20,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">The tail I could live with.
But the fleas, they're murder.</font>

1109
01:37:33,377 --> 01:37:34,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

1110
01:37:39,885 --> 01:37:42,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You better go.
- No. Don't worry, okay?</font>

1111
01:37:42,595 --> 01:37:43,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's fine. I'll stay.</font>

1112
01:37:44,765 --> 01:37:46,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">You go, I'll stay.</font>

1113
01:37:47,059 --> 01:37:50,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You okay?
- I'm fine. Go.</font>

1114
01:37:51,771 --> 01:37:54,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That looks really painful.
- So painful.</font>

1115
01:37:54,942 --> 01:37:57,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">They might chop it.</font>

1116
01:37:57,985 --> 01:38:00,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure Madam Pomfrey
will fix it in a heartbeat.</font>

1117
01:38:00,823 --> 01:38:05,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's too late. It's ruined.
It'll have to be chopped off.</font>

1118
01:38:06,286 --> 01:38:08,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's beautiful, isn't it?</font>

1119
01:38:08,956 --> 01:38:12,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll never forget the first time
I walked through those doors.</font>

1120
01:38:13,417 --> 01:38:16,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">It'll be nice to do it again
as a free man.</font>

1121
01:38:18,715 --> 01:38:21,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was a noble thing
you did back there.</font>

1122
01:38:22,344 --> 01:38:24,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">He doesn't deserve it.</font>

1123
01:38:24,680 --> 01:38:27,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't think my dad
would have wanted his best friends...</font>

1124
01:38:28,015 --> 01:38:29,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">to become killers.</font>

1125
01:38:29,725 --> 01:38:33,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">Besides, dead,
the truth dies with him.</font>

1126
01:38:33,604 --> 01:38:35,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alive, you're free.</font>

1127
01:38:36,149 --> 01:38:39,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Turn me into a flobberworm.
Anything but the dementors!</font>

1128
01:38:39,444 --> 01:38:42,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ron! Haven't I been a good pet?
You won't let them give me...</font>

1129
01:38:42,948 --> 01:38:45,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">to the dementors, will you?
I was your rat!</font>

1130
01:38:45,617 --> 01:38:49,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sweet, clever girl! Surely you won't...
- Get away from her!</font>

1131
01:38:52,123 --> 01:38:54,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know if you know, Harry...</font>

1132
01:38:54,208 --> 01:38:58,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">but when you were born, James
and Lily made me your godfather.</font>

1133
01:38:58,462 --> 01:39:00,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know.</font>

1134
01:39:01,591 --> 01:39:05,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can understand if you choose
to stay with your aunt and uncle...</font>

1135
01:39:05,804 --> 01:39:08,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">but if you ever wanted
a different home...</font>

1136
01:39:08,472 --> 01:39:10,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">What? Come and live with you?</font>

1137
01:39:12,269 --> 01:39:15,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just a thought.
I can understand if you don't want to.</font>

1138
01:39:15,646 --> 01:39:17,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry!</font>

1139
01:39:32,622 --> 01:39:36,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remus, my old friend.
Have you taken your potion tonight?</font>

1140
01:39:37,627 --> 01:39:42,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know the man you truly are, Remus!
This heart is where you truly live! Here!</font>

1141
01:39:44,301 --> 01:39:46,261

<font color="#FFFFFF">Remus! Remus!</font>

1145
01:40:11,453 --> 01:40:13,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">Run! Run!</font>

1146
01:40:23,798 --> 01:40:25,842

- Wait. Wait.</font>

1147
01:40:26,009 --> 01:40:31,055

01:45:43,034 --> 01:45:45,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw my dad.</font>

1159
01:45:45,621 --> 01:45:47,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

1160
01:45:47,372 --> 01:45:48,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">He sent the dementors away.</font>

1161
01:45:49,082 --> 01:45:50,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw him across the lake.</font>

1162
01:45:50,667 --> 01:45:52,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry, they've captured Sirius.</font>

1163
01:45:52,543 --> 01:45:55,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any minute the dementors
are gonna perform the Kiss.</font>

1164
01:45:55,546 --> 01:45:58,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">- They're gonna kill him?
- No. It's worse.</font>

1165
01:45:58,257 --> 01:46:00,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">Much worse.</font>

1166
01:46:00,260 --> 01:46:02,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're going to suck out his soul.</font>

1167
01:46:04,347 --> 01:46:05,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">Headmaster, stop them.</font>

1168
01:46:05,890 --> 01:46:09,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">- They've got the wrong man.
- It's true. Sirius is innocent.</font>

1169
01:46:09,435 --> 01:46:11,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's Scabbers who did it.
- Scabbers?</font>

1170
01:46:11,813 --> 01:46:13,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's my rat, sir.</font>

1171
01:46:13,606 --> 01:46:17,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not really a rat. He was a rat.
He was my brother Percy's rat.</font>

1172
01:46:17,610 --> 01:46:21,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But then they gave him an owl...
- The point is, we know the truth.</font>

1173
01:46:21,489 --> 01:46:23,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Please believe us.
- I do, Miss Granger.</font>

1174
01:46:24,201 --> 01:46:29,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the word of three 13-year-old
wizards will convince few others.</font>

1175
01:46:32,708 --> 01:46:35,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">A child's voice,
however honest and true...</font>

1176
01:46:35,671 --> 01:46:39,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">is meaningless to those
who have forgotten how to listen.</font>

1177
01:46:44,637 --> 01:46:47,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mysterious thing, time.</font>

1178
01:46:48,350 --> 01:46:49,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">Powerful...</font>

1179
01:46:49,851 --> 01:46:52,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">and when meddled with,
dangerous.</font>

1180
01:46:54,314 --> 01:46:57,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sirius Black is in the topmost
cell of the Dark Tower.</font>

1181
01:46:58,734 --> 01:47:00,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know the laws, Miss Granger.</font>

1182
01:47:01,029 --> 01:47:02,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must not be seen.</font>

1183
01:47:02,989 --> 01:47:06,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you would do well, I feel,
to return before this last chime.</font>

1184
01:47:06,827 --> 01:47:10,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">If not, the consequences
are too ghastly to discuss.</font>

1185
01:47:10,913 --> 01:47:12,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you succeed tonight...</font>

1186
01:47:12,875 --> 01:47:15,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">more than one innocent life
may be spared.</font>

1187
01:47:17,546 --> 01:47:19,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three turns should do it, I think.</font>

1188
01:47:24,636 --> 01:47:26,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, and by the way.</font>

1189
01:47:26,637 --> 01:47:32,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">When in doubt, I find retracing
my steps to be a wise place to begin.</font>

1190
01:47:32,644 --> 01:47:34,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good luck.</font>

1191
01:47:35,229 --> 01:47:37,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the bloody hell
was that all about?</font>

1192
01:47:38,358 --> 01:47:40,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, Ron, but seeing
as you can't walk...</font>

1193
01:48:09,680 --> 01:48:11,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">What just happened?</font>

1194
01:48:11,475 --> 01:48:13,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where's Ron?
- 7:30.</font>

1195
01:48:13,935 --> 01:48:15,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where were we at 7:30?</font>

1196
01:48:15,979 --> 01:48:17,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know. Going to Hagrid's?</font>

1197
01:48:17,939 --> 01:48:20,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on. And we can't be seen.</font>

1198
01:48:21,400 --> 01:48:23,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hermione!</font>

1199
01:48:41,421 --> 01:48:44,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hermione! Hermione, wait.</font>

1200
01:48:45,884 --> 01:48:49,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hermione, will you please tell me
what it is we're doing?</font>

1201
01:48:49,680 --> 01:48:52,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">You foul, loathsome,
evil little cockroach!</font>

1202
01:48:52,682 --> 01:48:54,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's us.</font>

1203
01:48:54,225 --> 01:48:57,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hermione, no! He's not worth it.</font>

1204
01:48:57,354 --> 01:48:58,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is not normal.</font>

1205
01:49:01,108 --> 01:49:03,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a Time-Turner, Harry.</font>

1206
01:49:03,652 --> 01:49:05,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">McGonagall gave it to me first term.</font>

1207
01:49:06,029 --> 01:49:09,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is how I've been getting
to my lessons all year.</font>

1208
01:49:09,574 --> 01:49:12,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You mean we've gone back in time?
- Yes.</font>

1209
01:49:12,953 --> 01:49:16,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dumbledore obviously wanted us
to return to this moment.</font>

1210
01:49:18,625 --> 01:49:21,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clearly, something happened
he wants us to change.</font>

1211
01:49:24,922 --> 01:49:26,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good punch.</font>

1212
01:49:26,425 --> 01:49:27,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks.</font>

1213
01:49:28,926 --> 01:49:30,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Malfoy's coming.</font>

1214
01:49:31,512 --> 01:49:33,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Run.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?</font>

1215
01:49:34,307 --> 01:49:37,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna get that jumped-up
mudblood! Mark my words.</font>

1216
01:49:37,560 --> 01:49:41,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.</font>

1217
01:49:42,858 --> 01:49:45,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on. We should be at Hagrid's.</font>

1218
01:50:04,587 --> 01:50:07,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look. Buckbeak's still alive.</font>

1219
01:50:08,591 --> 01:50:10,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course.</font>

1220
01:50:10,636 --> 01:50:12,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember what Dumbledore said?</font>

1221
01:50:12,804 --> 01:50:16,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we succeed, more than one
innocent life could be spared.</font>

1222
01:50:17,225 --> 01:50:18,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go.</font>

1223
01:50:39,832 --> 01:50:41,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here they come. I'd better hurry.</font>

1224
01:50:42,125 --> 01:50:44,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fudge has to see Buckbeak
before we steal him.</font>

1225
01:50:44,795 --> 01:50:47,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid
set him free.</font>

1226
01:50:48,297 --> 01:50:50,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">Scabbers, you're alive!</font>

1227
01:50:50,842 --> 01:50:53,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- That's Pettigrew.</font>

1228
01:50:53,845 --> 01:50:56,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Harry, you can't.
- He betrayed my parents.</font>

1229
01:50:56,931 --> 01:50:59,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You don't expect me to sit here.
- Yes, and you must!</font>

1230
01:51:03,814 --> 01:51:06,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now.</font>

1231
01:51:06,692 --> 01:51:09,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you go bursting in,
you'll think you've gone mad.</font>

1232
01:51:09,694 --> 01:51:12,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Awful things happen to wizards
who meddle with time.</font>

1233
01:51:12,738 --> 01:51:14,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can't be seen.</font>

1234
01:51:18,287 --> 01:51:19,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fudge is coming.</font>

1235
01:51:20,913 --> 01:51:22,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we aren't leaving?</font>

1236
01:51:25,168 --> 01:51:26,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why aren't we leaving?</font>

1237
01:51:37,680 --> 01:51:39,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you mad?</font>

1238
01:51:45,229 --> 01:51:46,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">That hurt.</font>

1239
01:51:46,814 --> 01:51:48,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry.</font>

1240
01:52:09,003 --> 01:52:11,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're coming out the back door. Go!</font>

1241
01:52:29,065 --> 01:52:31,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that really what my hair
looks like from the back?</font>

1242
01:52:33,945 --> 01:52:35,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

1243
01:52:36,155 --> 01:52:37,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought I just saw...</font>

1244
01:52:38,199 --> 01:52:40,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Never mind.
- Let's go.</font>

1245
01:52:55,175 --> 01:52:57,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, go, Harry. Go!</font>

1246
01:53:03,725 --> 01:53:05,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get away. Get off.</font>

1247
01:53:27,875 --> 01:53:31,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Minister, I really think
I should sign as well.</font>

1248
01:53:32,128 --> 01:53:35,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, very well. Perhaps it would be...</font>

1249
01:53:35,506 --> 01:53:39,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, Buckbeak. Come quickly.
Come with us now. Come on.</font>

1250
01:53:43,765 --> 01:53:46,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep trying. Come on. Quickly.</font>

1251
01:53:48,854 --> 01:53:52,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">Buckbeak. Okay?
Quickly. Hurry up. Okay?</font>

1252
01:53:53,484 --> 01:53:56,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Your name only.
- It's such a very long name...</font>

1253
01:53:57,154 --> 01:53:58,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay?</font>

1254
01:54:01,574 --> 01:54:04,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.
Come on, Buckbeak.</font>

1255
01:54:04,744 --> 01:54:07,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come and get the nice dead ferret.</font>

1256
01:54:09,666 --> 01:54:14,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Come on. It's here. Come on, Beaky.
- Here we are, minister. Follow me.</font>

1257
01:54:14,378 --> 01:54:16,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Now, look there.
- Where?</font>

1258
01:54:16,256 --> 01:54:19,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Look beyond the rocks.
- What am I supposed to see?</font>

1259
01:54:19,801 --> 01:54:23,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Dippet had that ling
planted when he was headmaster.</font>

1260
01:54:23,471 --> 01:54:26,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, yes. Indeed, indeed.
- And all the strawberries.</font>

1261
01:54:27,266 --> 01:54:30,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Come on, Buckbeak. Come on.
- I see no strawberries.</font>

1262
01:54:30,311 --> 01:54:31,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Over there.
- Where?</font>

1263
01:54:31,646 --> 01:54:33,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Over there.
- This way.</font>

1264
01:54:33,606 --> 01:54:36,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let's get this over, please.
- All right.</font>

1265
01:54:37,944 --> 01:54:39,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">But where is it?</font>

1266
01:54:40,572 --> 01:54:42,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw the beast, just now.</font>

1267
01:54:43,408 --> 01:54:45,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Not a moment ago!
- How extraordinary.</font>

1268
01:54:45,786 --> 01:54:47,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Buckbeak.</font>

1269
01:54:47,328 --> 01:54:51,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come now, Dumbledore.
Someone's obviously released him.</font>

1270
01:54:51,582 --> 01:54:52,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hagrid?
- Buckbeak.</font>

1271
01:54:53,126 --> 01:54:57,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think the minister's suggesting
you had anything to do with this.</font>

1272
01:54:57,588 --> 01:55:00,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">How could you?
You've been with us all the time.</font>

1273
01:55:00,591 --> 01:55:02,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Right.
- Well, well.</font>

1274
01:55:02,636 --> 01:55:04,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">We must search the grounds.</font>

1275
01:55:04,345 --> 01:55:07,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, search the skies,
if you must, minister.</font>

1276
01:55:07,557 --> 01:55:12,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup
of tea or a large brandy.</font>

1277
01:55:13,146 --> 01:55:17,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, executioner, your services
are no longer required.</font>

1278
01:55:17,317 --> 01:55:19,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

1279
01:55:19,403 --> 01:55:22,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll find no small glasses
in this house, professor.</font>

1280
01:55:33,457 --> 01:55:34,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Come on.
- This way.</font>

1281
01:55:41,757 --> 01:55:43,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">This way, now.</font>

1282
01:55:45,970 --> 01:55:47,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Now what?
- We save Sirius.</font>

1283
01:55:47,930 --> 01:55:50,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How?
- No idea.</font>

1284
01:55:59,734 --> 01:56:02,112
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>- Look. It's Lupin.
- Immobulus!</i></font>

1285
01:56:08,534 --> 01:56:10,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Snape's coming.</font>

1286
01:56:16,752 --> 01:56:18,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now we wait.</font>

1287
01:56:19,630 --> 01:56:21,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now we wait.</font>

1288
01:56:48,992 --> 01:56:52,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">- At least someone's enjoying himself.
- Yeah.</font>

1289
01:56:55,039 --> 01:56:56,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hermione?
- Yeah?</font>

1290
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:01,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">Before, down by the lake,
when I was with Sirius...</font>

1291
01:57:01,505 --> 01:57:03,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did see someone.</font>

1292
01:57:03,798 --> 01:57:07,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">That someone
made the dementors go away.</font>

1293
01:57:07,386 --> 01:57:08,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">With a Patronus.</font>

1294
01:57:08,886 --> 01:57:10,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard Snape telling Dumbledore.</font>

1295
01:57:10,972 --> 01:57:12,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">According to him...</font>

1296
01:57:12,599 --> 01:57:16,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">only a really powerful wizard
could have conjured it.</font>

1297
01:57:16,185 --> 01:57:18,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was my dad.</font>

1298
01:57:19,189 --> 01:57:20,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">My dad conjured the Patronus.</font>

1299
01:57:21,149 --> 01:57:23,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Harry, but your dad's...
- Dead. I know.</font>

1300
01:57:24,819 --> 01:57:27,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just telling you what I saw.</font>

1301
01:57:31,284 --> 01:57:32,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here we come.</font>

1302
01:57:38,583 --> 01:57:40,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see Sirius talking to me there?</font>

1303
01:57:41,127 --> 01:57:43,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He's asking me to come live with him.
- That's great.</font>

1304
01:57:44,131 --> 01:57:47,466
<font color="#FFFFFF">When we free him, I'll never
have to go back to the Dursleys'.</font>

1305
01:57:47,634 --> 01:57:49,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">It'll just be me and him.</font>

1306
01:57:49,927 --> 01:57:51,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">We could live in the country...</font>

1307
01:57:52,055 --> 01:57:54,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">someplace you can see the sky.</font>

1308
01:57:54,850 --> 01:57:57,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll like that after
all those years in Azkaban.</font>

1309
01:57:58,729 --> 01:58:00,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry!</font>

1310
01:58:01,814 --> 01:58:03,524
<font color="#FFFFFF">Run!</font>

1311
01:58:10,407 --> 01:58:11,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go.</font>

1312
01:58:31,511 --> 01:58:33,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What are you doing?
- Saving your life.</font>

1313
01:58:38,100 --> 01:58:39,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks.</font>

1314
01:58:41,313 --> 01:58:45,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Great. Now he's coming for us.
- Yeah, I didn't think about that. Run!</font>

1315
02:00:00,475 --> 02:00:02,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was so scary.</font>

1316
02:00:02,394 --> 02:00:05,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">Poor Professor Lupin's
having a really tough night.</font>

1317
02:00:16,783 --> 02:00:19,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sirius. Come on!</font>

1318
02:00:35,927 --> 02:00:38,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This is horrible.
- Don't worry.</font>

1319
02:00:38,221 --> 02:00:41,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">My dad will come.
He'll conjure the Patronus.</font>

1320
02:00:50,149 --> 02:00:51,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any minute now.</font>

1321
02:00:52,194 --> 02:00:54,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right there. You'll see.</font>

1322
02:00:55,613 --> 02:00:58,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry, listen to me.
No one's coming.</font>

1323
02:00:58,283 --> 02:01:00,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry, he will.
He will come.</font>

1324
02:01:04,957 --> 02:01:07,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sirius.
- You're dying...</font>

1325
02:01:09,461 --> 02:01:11,337
<font color="#FFFFFF">both of you.</font>

1326
02:01:13,422 --> 02:01:15,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry!</font>

1327
02:01:17,051 --> 02:01:20,889
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Expecto Patronum!</i></font>

1328
02:02:19,530 --> 02:02:21,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were right, Hermione.</font>

1329
02:02:21,283 --> 02:02:24,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">It wasn't my dad I saw earlier.
It was me!</font>

1330
02:02:24,786 --> 02:02:27,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw myself conjuring
the Patronus before.</font>

1331
02:02:27,706 --> 02:02:30,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew I could do it
this time because...</font>

1332
02:02:30,250 --> 02:02:31,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">well, I had already done it.</font>

1333
02:02:32,127 --> 02:02:34,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Does that make sense?
- No.</font>

1334
02:02:34,755 --> 02:02:37,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I don't like flying...!</font>

1335
02:02:50,729 --> 02:02:52,064
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Bombarda!</i></font>

1336
02:03:25,389 --> 02:03:28,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll be forever grateful for this...</font>

1337
02:03:28,350 --> 02:03:29,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">to both of you.</font>

1338
02:03:29,851 --> 02:03:32,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I want to go with you.
- One day, perhaps.</font>

1339
02:03:32,938 --> 02:03:35,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">For some time, my life
will be too unpredictable.</font>

1340
02:03:36,024 --> 02:03:37,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">And besides...</font>

1341
02:03:38,694 --> 02:03:41,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're meant to be here.
- But you're innocent.</font>

1342
02:03:42,155 --> 02:03:44,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you know it.</font>

1343
02:03:45,367 --> 02:03:47,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">And for now, that will do.</font>

1344
02:03:49,579 --> 02:03:52,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">I expect you're tired of hearing this...</font>

1345
02:03:53,125 --> 02:03:55,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you look so like your father.</font>

1346
02:03:57,421 --> 02:03:59,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">Except your eyes.</font>

1347
02:04:00,340 --> 02:04:02,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You have...
- My mother's eyes.</font>

1348
02:04:04,595 --> 02:04:09,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's cruel that I spent so much time
with James and Lily, and you so little.</font>

1349
02:04:10,266 --> 02:04:11,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">But know this:</font>

1350
02:04:12,895 --> 02:04:16,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">The ones that love us
never really leave us.</font>

1351
02:04:17,440 --> 02:04:19,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you can always find them...</font>

1352
02:04:21,778 --> 02:04:23,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">in here.</font>

1353
02:04:34,041 --> 02:04:36,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">You really are the brightest
witch of your age.</font>

1354
02:05:03,403 --> 02:05:05,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to go.</font>

1355
02:05:33,307 --> 02:05:35,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well?
- He's free. We did it.</font>

1356
02:05:36,145 --> 02:05:37,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did what?</font>

1357
02:05:37,854 --> 02:05:39,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good night.</font>

1358
02:05:48,573 --> 02:05:49,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did you get there?</font>

1359
02:05:50,074 --> 02:05:52,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was talking to you there.
And now you're there.</font>

1360
02:05:53,078 --> 02:05:55,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's he talking about, Harry?
- I don't know.</font>

1361
02:05:55,872 --> 02:05:59,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">Honestly, Ron. How can somebody
be in two places at once?</font>

1362
02:06:25,903 --> 02:06:27,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Harry.</font>

1363
02:06:31,033 --> 02:06:32,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw you coming.</font>

1364
02:06:37,413 --> 02:06:40,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've looked worse, believe me.</font>

1365
02:06:42,836 --> 02:06:46,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You've been sacked.
- No.</font>

1366
02:06:46,172 --> 02:06:49,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. I resigned, actually.</font>

1367
02:06:49,301 --> 02:06:51,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">Resigned? Why?</font>

1368
02:06:51,261 --> 02:06:56,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it seems that somebody
let slip the nature of my condition.</font>

1369
02:06:56,725 --> 02:07:02,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">This time tomorrow, the owls will start
arriving and parents will not want...</font>

1370
02:07:02,396 --> 02:07:05,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">well, someone like me
teaching their children.</font>

1371
02:07:05,984 --> 02:07:07,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But Dumbledore...
- He has already...</font>

1372
02:07:08,069 --> 02:07:09,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">risked enough on my behalf.</font>

1373
02:07:10,113 --> 02:07:13,367
<font color="#FFFFFF">Besides, people like me are...</font>

1374
02:07:13,992 --> 02:07:17,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, let's just say
that I'm used to it by now.</font>

1375
02:07:26,880 --> 02:07:29,423
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you look so miserable, Harry?</font>

1376
02:07:29,632 --> 02:07:31,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">None of it made any difference.</font>

1377
02:07:31,969 --> 02:07:35,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Pettigrew escaped.
- Didn't make any difference?</font>

1378
02:07:35,680 --> 02:07:39,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">It made all the difference in the world.
You uncovered the truth.</font>

1379
02:07:39,350 --> 02:07:41,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">You saved an innocent man
from a terrible fate.</font>

1380
02:07:42,229 --> 02:07:44,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">It made a great deal of difference.</font>

1381
02:07:49,360 --> 02:07:51,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I am proud of anything...</font>

1382
02:07:51,738 --> 02:07:54,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">it is of how much
you have learned this year.</font>

1383
02:07:54,574 --> 02:07:57,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, since I am no longer
your teacher...</font>

1384
02:07:57,493 --> 02:08:01,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">I feel no guilt whatsoever
about giving this back to you.</font>

1385
02:08:02,666 --> 02:08:05,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">So now I'll say goodbye, Harry.</font>

1386
02:08:05,335 --> 02:08:07,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">I feel sure we'll meet again sometime.</font>

1387
02:08:08,462 --> 02:08:09,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">Until then...</font>

1388
02:08:11,132 --> 02:08:12,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">mischief managed.</font>

1389
02:08:47,085 --> 02:08:51,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stand back, I said! Or I'll take it
upstairs if you don't settle.</font>

1390
02:08:51,465 --> 02:08:52,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harry.</font>

1391
02:08:53,716 --> 02:08:55,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wherever did you get it?</font>

1392
02:08:55,260 --> 02:08:57,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I have a go, Harry?
After you, of course.</font>

1393
02:08:57,845 --> 02:08:59,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What are you talking about?
- Quiet.</font>

1394
02:09:00,181 --> 02:09:03,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let the man through.
I didn't mean to open it, Harry.</font>

1395
02:09:03,644 --> 02:09:06,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was badly wrapped.
They made me do it.</font>

1396
02:09:06,313 --> 02:09:07,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did not.</font>

1397
02:09:09,190 --> 02:09:12,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's a Firebolt.
- It's the fastest broom in the world.</font>

1398
02:09:12,860 --> 02:09:14,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">For me?</font>

1399
02:09:14,570 --> 02:09:17,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But who sent it?
- No one knows.</font>

1400
02:09:17,282 --> 02:09:19,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">This came with it.</font>

1401
02:09:24,038 --> 02:09:25,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Go on, Harry!
- Yeah, let's see.</font>

1402
02:09:25,873 --> 02:09:27,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">How fast is it, Harry?</font>

1403
02:09:47,061 --> 02:09:48,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lumos.</font>

1404
02:09:48,855 --> 02:09:51,233
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I solemnly swear that I am
up to no good.</i></font>

1405
02:21:10,453 --> 02:21:12,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mischief managed.</font>

1406
02:21:18,003 --> 02:21:19,462
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Nox.</i></font>
