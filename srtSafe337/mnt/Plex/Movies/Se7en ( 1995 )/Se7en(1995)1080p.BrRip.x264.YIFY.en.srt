1
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:03,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">Neighbors heard them screaming
at each other, like, for two hours.</font>

2
00:01:03,314 --> 00:01:05,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing new. Then they
heard the gun go off.</font>

3
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:06,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">Both barrels.</font>

4
00:01:08,152 --> 00:01:10,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">A crime of passion.</font>

5
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

6
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:14,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just look at all the
passion on that wall.</font>

7
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:17,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well, this is a
done deal. All but the paperwork.</font>

8
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:23,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">The kid see it?</font>

9
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:25,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

10
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:26,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">The kid.</font>

11
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">What kind of fucking
question is that?</font>

12
00:01:30,216 --> 00:01:34,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are all gonna be real glad when we get
rid of you, Somerset, you know that?</font>

13
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:37,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's always these questions
with you. Did the kid see it?</font>

14
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:40,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who gives a fuck? He's dead.
His wife killed him.</font>

15
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anything else has nothing
to do with us.</font>

16
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">Detective Somerset?</font>

17
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:56,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Detective Mills.</font>

18
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:59,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lieutenant, I apologize
for interrupting like this...</font>

19
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:02,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">just get in town 20 minutes ago,
they dump me here.</font>

20
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, um...</font>

21
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mills?</font>

22
00:02:05,668 --> 00:02:08,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought we might
find a bar someplace. Sit, talk—</font>

23
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd like to get to the precinct.</font>

24
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:13,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, not much time
for this transition thing.</font>

25
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:17,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">I meant to ask you something,
when we spoke on the phone before.</font>

26
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:18,973
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

27
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:21,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why here?</font>

28
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:23,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't follow.</font>

29
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:26,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, all this effort
to get transferred.</font>

30
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the first question
that popped into my head.</font>

31
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:32,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess for the same reasons as you.</font>

32
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:36,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or the same reasons you had
before you decided to quit, yeah?</font>

33
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just met me.</font>

34
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe I'm not understanding
the question.</font>

35
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:46,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's very simple.</font>

36
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:50,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">You actually fought
to get reassigned here.</font>

37
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've just never seen it done
that way before.</font>

38
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:55,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought I could do some good.
It would be great...</font>

39
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">if we didn't start out
kicking each other in the balls.</font>

40
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you're calling the shots, lieutenant—
Yes.</font>

41
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to look
and I want you to listen, okay?</font>

42
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,941
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, I wasn't standing around
guarding the Taco Bell.</font>

43
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:13,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've worked Homicide five years.
Not here.</font>

44
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">I understand that.</font>

45
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:19,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, over the next seven days, detective,
you'll do me the favor of remembering that.</font>

46
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, hey. I almost died.</font>

47
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shut the fuck up down there!</font>

48
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:05,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello? Yeah.</font>

49
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

50
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:09,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say it again.</font>

51
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:15,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought we moved here
to get away from tractor pulls.</font>

52
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">Serpico's gotta go.</font>

53
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:27,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well, you might wanna get rid
of this little crusty.</font>

54
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:29,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">This eye, Serpico.</font>

55
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:30,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you get it?
Got it.</font>

56
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good.</font>

57
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:50,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">Coffee?
No?</font>

58
00:07:54,475 --> 00:07:57,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing's been touched.
Everything's like I found it.</font>

59
00:07:57,728 --> 00:07:59,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">What time was death established?</font>

60
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like I said...</font>

61
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't touch anything.</font>

62
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:06,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">But he's had his face in a plate of
spaghetti for about 45 minutes now.</font>

63
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait a minute.
No one bothers with vital signs?</font>

64
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:10,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did I stutter?</font>

65
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:14,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">This guy ain't breathing unless he
started breathing spaghetti sauce.</font>

66
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:17,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">So that's how it's done around here?
I beg your pardon, detective.</font>

67
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:21,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">But this guy's been sitting
in a pile of his own piss and shit.</font>

68
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">If he wasn't dead,
he would've stood up by now.</font>

69
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, thank you, officer.
Okay.</font>

70
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

71
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:38,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wonder.</font>

72
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:45,067
<font color="#FFFFFF">What exactly was the point of the
conversation you were about to get into?</font>

73
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:46,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't know.</font>

74
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:50,364
<font color="#FFFFFF">How many times has Barney Fife
found dead bodies that weren't dead?</font>

75
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:53,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">Drop it.</font>

76
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:19,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oof.</font>

77
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:27,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somebody phone Guinness.
I think we've got a record here.</font>

78
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,128
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Better Homes and Gardens.</i></font>

79
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:48,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oof.</font>

80
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who said this was murder?</font>

81
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one.</font>

82
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:05,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guy's heart's gotta be the size
of a canned ham.</font>

83
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:13,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">If this isn't a coronary,
well, ha, ha, I don't know.</font>

84
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whoops.</font>

85
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:41,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">How about that?</font>

86
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:52,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">We had this case once.</font>

87
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:56,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guy dead on the ground.</font>

88
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Knife in his back.</font>

89
00:10:57,532 --> 00:10:59,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gotta be murder, right?</font>

90
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:02,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck.</font>

91
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:05,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyway,
big insurance policy involved, yeah?</font>

92
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:10,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">So the guy took the tip of the blade,
stuck it in his own shoulder blades.</font>

93
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:14,508
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he must've screwed up a few times
because there was multiples back there.</font>

94
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could you please be quiet?</font>

95
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait a minute.</font>

96
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:28,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

97
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:33,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got a bucket here.</font>

98
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:34,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's in it?</font>

99
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:39,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">Agh!</font>

100
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God.</font>

101
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fucking vomit.</font>

102
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:47,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any blood in it?</font>

103
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:50,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't see any.
Help yourself.</font>

104
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:57,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you thinking it's poison?</font>

105
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:01,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, wonderful. Very moody.</font>

106
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:02,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thinking it's poison, Somerset?</font>

107
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:06,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">You girls have got Forensics
waiting outside.</font>

108
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:10,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't know if we'll all fit, though.
There's room, light's the problem.</font>

109
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, how are you?
Hey.</font>

110
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:17,111
<font color="#FFFFFF">Detective Mills, would you go help
the officers question the neighbors?</font>

111
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:22,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?
Send in Forensics on your way out, please.</font>

112
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's dead.</font>

113
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:43,013
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, doctor.</font>

114
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:52,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've seen my files, right?
You seen the things I've done.</font>

115
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:53,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nope.</font>

116
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:58,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did my time on door-to-doors
and walking the beat.</font>

117
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did that shit for a long time.</font>

118
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">And?</font>

119
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">Badge on my belt says "detective."
That's the same as yours.</font>

120
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:10,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I made a decision.</font>

121
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:13,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had to consider
the integrity of the scene.</font>

122
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:17,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">Couldn't worry whether you thought you
were getting enough on the playing field.</font>

123
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, man...</font>

124
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:23,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">just don't be jerking me off,
that's all I ask. Don't jerk me off.</font>

125
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:31,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's been dead a long time.</font>

126
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:34,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I can tell you,
it was not from poison.</font>

127
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, man.</font>

128
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:37,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">How does someone
let themselves go like that?</font>

129
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">It took four orderlies
just to get him on the table.</font>

130
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:46,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">How'd the fat fuck
ever fit out his front door?</font>

131
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please.
It's obvious he was a shut-in.</font>

132
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, look at this.</font>

133
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:52,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">See how big this stomach is?</font>

134
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:55,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the strange thing is,
it stretches.</font>

135
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:58,629
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here. Look at the size of the
cardiac orifice, where the food—</font>

136
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:01,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, I see what you're pointing out,
but that means nothing to me.</font>

137
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:05,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. He's got lines of distention
across the duodenum.</font>

138
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:08,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the interior
wall is ripped open.</font>

139
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:11,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">This man ate till he burst?</font>

140
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:13,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">He didn't really burst.
Not all the way.</font>

141
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:16,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was hemorrhaging internally.</font>

142
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:20,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">And there was a hematoma in the rectus
and transverse abdominis muscles.</font>

143
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">So he did die by eating.</font>

144
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:24,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes and no.</font>

145
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:27,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about these bruises up here?</font>

146
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:31,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I haven't
figured that out yet.</font>

147
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:33,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gun pressed against his head?</font>

148
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:35,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pressed hard enough, sure.</font>

149
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck, yeah.</font>

150
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">Marks from the front side,
flush with the muzzle.</font>

151
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:45,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ladies and gentlemen,
we have ourselves a homicide.</font>

152
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Killer put a bucket
beneath him, kept on serving.</font>

153
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:52,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Took his time, too.</font>

154
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:55,269
<font color="#FFFFFF">Coroner said this could've gone on
more than 12 hours.</font>

155
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:58,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">Victim's throat was swollen,
probably from the effort.</font>

156
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:01,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">And there was definitely a point
when he passed out.</font>

157
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:04,486
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's when the killer kicked him
and he burst.</font>

158
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oof.
Sadistic fucker, huh?</font>

159
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">When you want somebody
dead, you drive by and shoot.</font>

160
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:12,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't risk the time
it takes to do this.</font>

161
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unless the act itself has meaning.
Come on.</font>

162
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:19,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somebody had a problem with the fat
boy and decided to torture him.</font>

163
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:20,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">Simple as that.</font>

164
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the grocery bags,
we found two receipts.</font>

165
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:25,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">That means the killer stopped
in the middle...</font>

166
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">and made a second trip
to the supermarket.</font>

167
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">So?</font>

168
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:33,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, man, it's his thing.
I've been out in the rain all day.</font>

169
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:34,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is beginning.</font>

170
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've got one dead guy,
not three.</font>

171
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">No motive.</font>

172
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:43,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't even start that big brain of
yours cooking on this, all right?</font>

173
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:46,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, I'd like to be reassigned.</font>

174
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:47,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?
What?</font>

175
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:50,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, whoa?
What in the hell are you talking about?</font>

176
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:53,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">This can't be my last duty.</font>

177
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:55,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just gonna go on
and on and on.</font>

178
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:56,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're retiring.</font>

179
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">Six more days
and you're all the way gone.</font>

180
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">Won't be the first time
you've left unfinished—</font>

181
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:05,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those other oases were taken as close
to conclusion as humanly possible.</font>

182
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if I may speak freely?</font>

183
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:08,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're all friends here.</font>

184
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:11,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">This should not be his first assignment.
Oh, come on, I knew it.</font>

185
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:14,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is not my first assignment,
you dick.</font>

186
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:15,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's too soon for him.</font>

187
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, man, I'm right here.
You can say that shit to my face.</font>

188
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:20,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Captain—
It's too soon for you.</font>

189
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">Captain,
if we can just talk in private?</font>

190
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">This isn't working.
It's a personal thing.</font>

191
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe—
Just shut up, Mills.</font>

192
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:31,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I don't have anyone else
to put on this and you know it.</font>

193
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:34,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is Metro. You don't just get to swap.</font>

194
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:36,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give it to me.</font>

195
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,956
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say what?
Yeah, he doesn't want it, fuck him.</font>

196
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:41,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, but see you later.
Have a nice time.</font>

197
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:44,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give it to me.
No, I'm putting you on something else.</font>

198
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on, Mills.</font>

199
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:49,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just go on.</font>

200
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, old buddy.</font>

201
00:16:57,017 --> 00:17:00,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it looks like you're stuck
cleaning up the fat man.</font>

202
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, here we go. Quiet down.</font>

203
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:23,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, calm down.
Calm down.</font>

204
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:25,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quiet down.</font>

205
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:27,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Calm down. Quiet down.</font>

206
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:30,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, here's how it's gonna work.</font>

207
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:34,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll answer questions for 10 minutes
and 10 minutes only.</font>

208
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:38,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">If those questions do not come in a
calm, sane and orderly fashion...</font>

209
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,808
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm on my way out here.</font>

210
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:41,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">Detective?
Detective?</font>

211
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:44,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I have a moment of your time?
No.</font>

212
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:52,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will not discuss the details
of this ongoing investigation...</font>

213
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:53,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">so don't even bother asking.</font>

214
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:57,868
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I've got shopping tools...</i></font>

215
00:17:58,036 --> 00:18:00,246
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>That's 25 Berlin.</i></font>

216
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">That looks like him.</font>

217
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:11,257
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Three items for your case number.</i></font>

218
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:16,261
<font color="#FFFFFF">What you guys got for me?
Nothing yet, boss.</font>

219
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:23,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you guys, uh,
go get a coffee, huh?</font>

220
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:26,355
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>We have this breaking story for you.</i></font>

221
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,398
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>We're going to go live downtown...</i></font>

222
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:31,861
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>where defense attorney Eli Gould
was found murdered this morning.</i></font>

223
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:35,698
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>District Attorney Martin Talbot
is taking questions from reporters.</i></font>

224
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:39,743
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>There
could be a conflict of interest—</i></font>

225
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:44,039
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>That is ridiculous to the point of being
offensive. There is no conflict whatsoever.</i></font>

226
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:45,875
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>And any claim that there could be...</i></font>

227
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,294
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>is irresponsible.</i>
<i>Mr. Talbot, Mr. Talbot.</i></font>

228
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:50,296
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Hold on.</i>
<i>It's rumored you're far...</i></font>

229
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:53,133
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>from apprehending a suspect.</i>

231
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:59,806
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>they have their
very best men on this.</i></font>

232
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:05,144
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>This will be the very definition
of swift justice.</i></font>

233
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:30,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pardon me, George.</font>

234
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:37,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somerset.
Come in.</font>

235
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you heard the news?
Nope, haven't heard.</font>

236
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:44,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eli Gould was found murdered
this morning.</font>

237
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:48,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone broke into his law firm
and bled him to death.</font>

238
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:51,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wrote the word
"greed" on the floor.</font>

239
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:59,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">Greed?
Yeah, in blood.</font>

240
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mills is heading up
the investigation.</font>

241
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:04,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, excuse me.
Excuse me?</font>

242
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:07,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could you not do that, please?</font>

243
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:09,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, okay.</font>

244
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:12,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, good for him.</font>

245
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:15,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">What in the hell are you gonna do
with yourself out there, Somerset?</font>

246
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:17,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I'll work,
maybe on a farm.</font>

247
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fix my house.</font>

248
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you feel it?</font>

249
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:23,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you feel that feeling?</font>

250
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:26,433
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not gonna be a cop anymore.</font>

251
00:20:26,601 --> 00:20:28,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the whole idea.</font>

252
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:31,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think you're leaving.</font>

253
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:34,651
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hell, you can't leave all this.</font>

254
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:38,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guy's out walking his dog.</font>

255
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,448

00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:43,326

his wallet.</font>

257
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:46,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">While he's lying there
on the sidewalk, helpless...</font>

258
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:50,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">his attacker stabs
him in both eyes.</font>

259
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">This happened just last night
about four blocks from here.</font>

260
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I read about it.</font>

261
00:20:57,507 --> 00:21:01,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't understand this place any longer.
It's the way it's always been.</font>

262
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe you're right.</font>

263
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:04,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">You do this work.</font>

264
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:07,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were made for it and I
don't think you can deny that.</font>

265
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe I'm wrong.</font>

266
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:15,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, uh, the coroner
sent this down for you.</font>

267
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:19,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">Found them in fat boy's stomach,
mixed in with food.</font>

268
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:23,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like plastic, little pieces of plastic.
Set them on the desk, please.</font>

269
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:29,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">They were, uh...</font>

270
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:30,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">They were fed to him.</font>

271
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:11,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Lord.</font>

272
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:21,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">This was found on the wall
behind the refrigerator...</font>

273
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:24,319

277
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:36,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, I'm confused.</font>

278
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:39,419
<font color="#FFFFFF">It means that this is beginning.</font>

279
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:42,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">This was found
behind the same refrigerator.</font>

280
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">Written in grease.</font>

281

<font color="#FFFFFF">Sloth, wrath, pride, lust...</font>

285
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:01,857

286
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:04,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seven.
Hold on.</font>

287
00:24:04,527 --> 00:24:06,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is not even my desk.</font>

288
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:09,781
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can expect five more of these.</font>

289
00:24:11,576 --> 00:24:12,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, wait a minute.</font>

290
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:16,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't get involved in this.</font>

291
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:20,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somerset.</font>

292
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,961

293
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:26,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn.
I'm all over it.</font>

294
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:29,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's wrong with you?</font>

295
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:01,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where you headed?</font>

296
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:06,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">Far away from here.</font>

297
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:18,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks, George.
How you doing?</font>

298
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:20,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just a few things to look up.</font>

299
00:25:20,353 --> 00:25:22,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Sit where you'd like.</font>

300
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:24,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">How's everybody?</font>

301
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:28,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, Smiley.</font>

302
00:25:28,486 --> 00:25:30,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, George,
the cards are getting cold.</font>

303
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Duty calls.</font>

304
00:25:48,381 --> 00:25:50,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gentlemen, gentlemen.</font>

305
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:52,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll never understand.</font>

306
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:55,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">All these books...</font>

307
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:57,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">a world of knowledge
at your fingertips.</font>

308
00:25:57,807 --> 00:25:59,392
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you do?</font>

309
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">You play poker all night.</font>

310
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, we got culture.</font>

311
00:26:03,813 --> 00:26:05,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, we got culture
coming out of our asses.</font>

312
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

313
00:26:09,986 --> 00:26:12,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">How's this for culture?</font>

314
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:51,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, Smiley...</font>

315
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:54,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're really gonna miss us.</font>

316
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just might.</font>

317
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:56,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fucking Dante.</font>

318
00:29:57,046 --> 00:30:01,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goddamn poetry-writing faggot
piece of shit.</font>

319
00:30:01,592 --> 00:30:03,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fucker.</font>

320
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah?</font>

321
00:30:13,938 --> 00:30:15,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good work, officer.</font>

322
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:24,906
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, Lord.</font>

323
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I'm sorry.</font>

324
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be out of your way in a second.</font>

325
00:30:49,682 --> 00:30:51,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want your chair?
No. You go ahead.</font>

326
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:53,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah?</font>

327
00:31:32,016 --> 00:31:33,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">Phone.</font>

328
00:31:33,976 --> 00:31:35,102
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a package deal.</font>

329
00:31:35,269 --> 00:31:36,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">Comes with the office.</font>

330
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:42,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mills.
<i>Honey.</i></font>

331
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:46,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you okay, something wrong?
No.</font>

332
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:51,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">You dingleberry, I, uh, told you not
to call me here when I'm working.</font>

333
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:54,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Why?</font>

334
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:55,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

335
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:59,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?
Come on.</font>

336
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:04,339
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

337
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:09,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's my wife.</font>

338
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:10,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry?</font>

339
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,473
<font color="#FFFFFF">She'd like to speak to you.</font>

340
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:25,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, this is Detective Somerset.</font>

341
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:27,363
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Oh, it's nice to speak with you.</i></font>

342
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:30,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it's nice to talk to you too.</font>

343
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:34,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">I appreciate the offer, but—</font>

344
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:40,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, in that case I'd be delighted.
Great.</font>

345
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:43,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, thank you very much.
<i>Thank you. See you later.</i></font>

346
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:44,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bye.</font>

347
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:48,174
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hon, what—?</font>

348
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:57,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well?</font>

349
00:32:58,018 --> 00:33:00,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry? Oh, uh.
What?</font>

350
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:03,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been invited to a late supper
at your apartment.</font>

351
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:04,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">I accepted.</font>

352
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:07,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">At my— How's that?</font>

353
00:33:07,403 --> 00:33:08,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tonight.</font>

354
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:12,490
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Twenty-one-fifty-seven.</i></font>

355
00:33:15,536 --> 00:33:17,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, men.</font>

356
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:19,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, loser.
Hi, idiot.</font>

357
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:22,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is Tracy.</font>

358
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somerset.
Hello.</font>

359
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:29,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm very happy to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.</font>

360
00:33:29,967 --> 00:33:31,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">Except, of course,
your first name.</font>

361
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:34,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's William.</font>

362
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:39,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm, well,
it's a good name, William.</font>

363
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:41,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">William,
I'd like you to meet David.</font>

364
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:44,147
<font color="#FFFFFF">David, this is William.
Okay, all right, I'm gonna—</font>

365
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:45,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll be right back.</font>

366
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:47,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">How are the kids?
Good, they're in the room.</font>

367
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:49,361
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on in.</font>

368
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:52,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, good dogs.</font>

369
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:55,366
<font color="#FFFFFF">How are you, good dogs?
How are you, pretty?</font>

370
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:59,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">How are you?</font>

371
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:02,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">How are you?</font>

372
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:04,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are?</font>

373
00:34:06,336 --> 00:34:08,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">Smells good.
What?</font>

374
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:09,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh.
Oh.</font>

375
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.
I mean, thank you.</font>

376
00:34:13,177 --> 00:34:16,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, please have a seat, if you like.
Would you like something to drink?</font>

377
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:18,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, no. No, thanks.</font>

378
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:21,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll wait.
Okay, you can just throw that anywhere.</font>

379
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:25,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll have to excuse all this mess.
You know, we're still unpacking.</font>

380
00:34:27,733 --> 00:34:29,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">I understand you two
were high school sweethearts.</font>

381
00:34:30,152 --> 00:34:31,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hm.</font>

382
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pretty hokey, huh?</font>

383
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:37,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know something?</font>

384
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:40,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew on our first date that this
was the guy I was gonna marry.</font>

385
00:34:40,871 --> 00:34:42,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really?
Mm-hm.</font>

386
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:45,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was the funniest
guy I'd ever met.</font>

387
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:51,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really?</font>

388
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it's kind of rare
nowadays, you know.</font>

389
00:34:57,096 --> 00:35:00,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, that level of commitment.</font>

390
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:07,146
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, don't worry.</font>

391
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:10,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">I won't wear it to the dinner table.
No, ha, ha.</font>

392
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:13,862
<font color="#FFFFFF">I, uh— You know, no matter
how often I see guns, I just—</font>

393
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:16,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't get used to them.</font>

394
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:18,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Same here.</font>

395
00:35:29,253 --> 00:35:30,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why aren't you married, William?</font>

396
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:33,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Trace,
what the hell?</font>

397
00:35:33,382 --> 00:35:35,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was close once.</font>

398
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:37,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">It just didn't happen.</font>

399
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:39,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">It surprises me.</font>

400
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:41,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">It really does.</font>

401
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:44,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well...</font>

402
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:49,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyone who spends a significant amount
of time with me finds me disagreeable.</font>

403
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just ask your husband.</font>

404
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very true.</font>

405
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:55,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very, very true.</font>

406
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">So how long have you lived here?</font>

407
00:35:58,949 --> 00:35:59,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Too long.</font>

408
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:05,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">How are you liking it?</font>

409
00:36:07,166 --> 00:36:11,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, takes time,
settle in.</font>

410
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:13,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">It'll be good.</font>

411
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you get numb after awhile.</font>

412
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are things to any city.</font>

413
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:26,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">Subway.</font>

414
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:30,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">It will go away in a minute.
It's nothing.</font>

415
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">Real estate guy.</font>

416
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:36,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fucking piece of...</font>

417
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:38,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, honey.
He's...</font>

418
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">He shows us the place
a few times.</font>

419
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think he's good.
He's efficient.</font>

420
00:36:43,076 --> 00:36:44,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tracy really likes him.</font>

421
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:49,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I start wondering why will he only
bring us here five minutes at a time, yeah?</font>

422
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:51,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">We found out the first night.</font>

423
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:56,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">The soothing, relaxing,
vibrating home, huh?</font>

424
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:06,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry.</font>

425
00:37:13,523 --> 00:37:15,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, all right, laugh it up.</font>

426
00:37:18,862 --> 00:37:20,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know why you're laughing.</font>

427
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:26,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, already.</font>

428
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:31,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">The guy would've had to get in...</font>

429
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:34,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">before the office was closed
and security tightened.</font>

430
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, Gould would've
been working late.</font>

431
00:37:36,672 --> 00:37:39,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm certain. He was the biggest
defense lawyer in town.</font>

432
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:40,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">Infamous, really.</font>

433
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now listen, body was found
on Tuesday morning.</font>

434
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:47,641
<font color="#FFFFFF">The office was closed on Monday, which
means the guy could've gotten in Friday...</font>

435
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:52,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">laid low till the cleaning crew left then
had his way with Gould all day Saturday...</font>

436
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:54,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sunday, maybe even Monday.</font>

437
00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:56,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, look at this.</font>

438
00:37:56,858 --> 00:37:59,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gould was bound,
right arm almost free.</font>

439
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was handed a
butcher's knife.</font>

440
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:04,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">Check out the scale.</font>

441
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">A pound of flesh?</font>

442
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:08,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

443
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:21,717
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Merchant of Venice.</i>
Didn't see it.</font>

444
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:25,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">"This task done and
he would go free."</font>

445
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:28,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm telling you that chair
was soaked through with sweat.</font>

446
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course.</font>

447
00:38:30,726 --> 00:38:33,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">The killer would've wanted Gould
to take his time...</font>

448
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:37,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">to sit and decide
which out to make first.</font>

449
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:39,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">Imagine it.</font>

450
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a gun in your face.</font>

451
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which part of your body
is expendable?</font>

452
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:46,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about the love handle?</font>

453
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:49,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cut along the side of
his own stomach.</font>

454
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:52,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, let's take a
fresh look at these.</font>

455
00:38:52,914 --> 00:38:55,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even though the corpse is there,
look through it.</font>

456
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:57,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">Edit out the initial shock.</font>

457
00:38:57,251 --> 00:39:02,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">Trick is to find one item,
one detail and focus on it...</font>

458
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">until it's an
exhausted possibility.</font>

459
00:39:05,552 --> 00:39:07,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just gonna get another beer.
Beer?</font>

460
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:09,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, wine, please.</font>

461
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:19,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's preaching.</font>

462
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's punishing.</font>

463
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:26,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">The sins were used
in medieval sermons.</font>

464
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:29,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">There were seven cardinal virtues
and seven deadly sins...</font>

465
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">used as teaching tools.</font>

466
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:34,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, yeah, yeah,
like in, uh, The Parson's Tale and—</font>

467
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:35,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's this? Uh, Dante.</font>

468
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:38,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">You read them?
Yeah.</font>

469
00:39:38,335 --> 00:39:41,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, parts.
Hey, remember in, uh, Purgatory?</font>

470
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:43,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dante and his buddy,
they're climbing up the hill...</font>

471
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:46,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">they're checking out
all the sinners, yeah?</font>

472
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:49,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, the seven terraces of purgation.
Yeah, yeah, right.</font>

473
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:53,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">But there, pride comes first,
not gluttony.</font>

474
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:57,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well, for now, let's just consider
that the books were the killer's inspiration.</font>

475
00:39:57,521 --> 00:40:00,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">The sermons
were about atonement for sin.</font>

476
00:40:01,233 --> 00:40:03,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">These murders are
like forced attrition.</font>

477
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:06,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forced what?
Attrition.</font>

478
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:08,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's when you regret your sins,
but not because you love God.</font>

479
00:40:09,157 --> 00:40:12,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, like because someone's sticking
a fucking gun in your face.</font>

480
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:13,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hm.</font>

481
00:40:16,206 --> 00:40:18,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">No fingerprints.
Nope.</font>

482
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:22,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">Totally unrelated victims.
Yup.</font>

483
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:24,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">And no witnesses of any kind.</font>

484
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:26,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which I don't get.</font>

485
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:29,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because the fucker
had to get back out.</font>

486
00:40:30,387 --> 00:40:34,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, in any major city, minding
your own business is a science.</font>

487
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:39,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">The first thing they teach women in
rape prevention is never cry for help.</font>

488
00:40:39,855 --> 00:40:41,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">Always yell "Fire."</font>

489
00:40:41,523 --> 00:40:42,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody answers to "Help."</font>

490
00:40:42,983 --> 00:40:44,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">You holler "fire,"
they come running.</font>

491
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:46,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's fucked up.</font>

492
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:50,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">He must've left another
puzzle piece.</font>

493
00:40:51,867 --> 00:40:52,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what?</font>

494
00:40:53,076 --> 00:40:56,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you for talking this
out, but I gotta sleep.</font>

495
00:40:56,746 --> 00:41:00,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">Walk the dogs.
This is just strictly to satisfy my curiosity.</font>

496
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:03,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm still leaving at the end of the week.
Oh, shit.</font>

497
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, wait, wait.</font>

498
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:08,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gould's wife. She was
out of town at the time.</font>

499
00:41:09,009 --> 00:41:12,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">So this means she saw something.
What if it's a threat?</font>

500
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:15,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I put her in a safe house.
She wasn't too happy about it.</font>

501
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:26,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if it isn't
something she has seen?</font>

502
00:41:27,027 --> 00:41:31,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">But something she's supposed to see,
but hasn't been given a chance?</font>

503
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:32,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, okay. What?</font>

504
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:35,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

505
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:38,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">But that's the one thing.</font>

506
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sign us in.</font>

507
00:42:25,835 --> 00:42:27,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gotta see Mrs. Gould.</font>

508
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">treat me like a prisoner.</font>

509
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:33,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you have a phone if I can't
make long distance phone calls?</font>

510
00:42:33,927 --> 00:42:35,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mrs. Gould?</font>

511
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:36,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't treat people like this.</font>

512
00:42:41,643 --> 00:42:44,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mrs. Gould, I am sorry.
I truly am.</font>

513
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:46,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't understand.</font>

514
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:51,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I need you to look at
each photo very carefully.</font>

515
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:56,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look and see if there's anything
strange or out of place.</font>

516
00:42:57,157 --> 00:42:58,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, anything at all.</font>

517
00:42:59,202 --> 00:43:01,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't see anything.
You're sure?</font>

518
00:43:01,413 --> 00:43:03,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, I just—
I can't do this right now.</font>

519
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:05,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

520
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:07,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's got to be now.</font>

521
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:10,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">There may be something
we haven't seen.</font>

522
00:43:19,054 --> 00:43:20,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait.</font>

523
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:22,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?
Here.</font>

524
00:43:26,271 --> 00:43:29,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">This painting, it's upside down.</font>

525
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:39,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">You sure your men didn't move this?
No, no.</font>

526
00:43:39,409 --> 00:43:42,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those shots were taken
before forensics.</font>

527
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:46,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing.</font>

528
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:50,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's gotta be something.</font>

529
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:03,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">Moved the screws to rehang it.
Yep.</font>

530
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:09,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the fuck is that?</font>

531
00:44:10,523 --> 00:44:12,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Switchblade.</font>

532
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:22,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goddamn it.</font>

533
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:28,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">There must be something.</font>

534
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:35,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">He didn't paint the fucking thing.</font>

535
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:46,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, he's fucking with us,
that's what he's doing.</font>

536
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:49,144
<font color="#FFFFFF">See this? This is us.</font>

537
00:44:49,771 --> 00:44:50,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

538
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:52,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just wait a minute.</font>

539
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:57,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now Somerset's climbing
on the furniture.</font>

540
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just wait a minute.</font>

541
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:05,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're kidding me.</font>

542
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:08,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">Call the Print Lab.</font>

543
00:45:13,545 --> 00:45:15,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, man.</font>

544
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:22,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">Honestly, have you ever
seen anything like this?</font>

545
00:45:24,681 --> 00:45:26,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

546
00:45:28,143 --> 00:45:30,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can tell you, guys, just by
looking at the swirl pattern...</font>

547
00:45:31,353 --> 00:45:33,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">they're not the
victim's fingerprints.</font>

548
00:45:43,992 --> 00:45:48,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know, man.
I say he's whacked enough.</font>

549
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:50,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">It doesn't fit.</font>

550
00:45:51,708 --> 00:45:54,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">He doesn't wants us to help him stop.
Who knows?</font>

551
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:58,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">So many freaks out there doing their
little evil deeds they don't wanna do.</font>

552
00:45:58,797 --> 00:46:01,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">"The voices made me do it.
My dog made me do it.</font>

553
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:03,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jodie Foster told me to do it."</font>

554
00:46:04,012 --> 00:46:07,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, um, I've seen this baby take
as long as three days to make a match...</font>

555
00:46:07,766 --> 00:46:11,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">so maybe you guys wanna cross
your fingers somewhere else.</font>

556
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:17,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">You meant what you said to
Mrs. Gould, didn't you?</font>

557
00:46:17,525 --> 00:46:20,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">About catching this guy.
Yeah.</font>

558
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:22,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

559
00:46:22,864 --> 00:46:25,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wish I still thought the way you do.</font>

560
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:30,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you tell me what the hell
it is you think we're doing then.</font>

561
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:33,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">Picking up the pieces.</font>

562
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:39,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're collecting all the evidence,
taking all the pictures and samples.</font>

563
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:41,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">Writing everything down.</font>

564
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:44,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">Noting the time things happened.</font>

565
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:48,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's all?
That's all.</font>

566
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:52,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">Putting everything into neat
little piles and filing it away.</font>

567
00:46:53,061 --> 00:46:56,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">On the off chance it will ever
be needed in the courtroom.</font>

568
00:46:59,192 --> 00:47:02,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">Picking up diamonds
on a deserted island.</font>

569
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:06,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">Saving them in case we get rescued.</font>

570
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:10,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bullshit.</font>

571
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:16,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even the most promising clues
usually only lead to others.</font>

572
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:22,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">So many corpses roll
away unrevenged.</font>

573
00:47:23,967 --> 00:47:28,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't try to tell me
you didn't get that rush tonight.</font>

574
00:47:28,721 --> 00:47:30,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw you.</font>

575
00:47:31,224 --> 00:47:33,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're getting somewhere.</font>

576
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:50,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wake up, Glimmer Twins.</font>

577
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:52,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've got a winner.</font>

578
00:47:58,418 --> 00:48:02,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">This guy goes by the name of Victor.
His real name is Theodore Allen.</font>

579
00:48:02,255 --> 00:48:04,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">His prints were found
at the scene by Homicide.</font>

580
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:08,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's got a long history
of serious mental illness.</font>

581
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:11,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">His parents gave him a very strict
Southern Baptist upbringing.</font>

582
00:48:12,056 --> 00:48:14,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">But somewhere along the line,
they fell short.</font>

583
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:17,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, Victor dabbled in drugs,
armed robbery and assault.</font>

584
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:21,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">Spent time in prison here a while back
for the attempted rape of a minor.</font>

585
00:48:21,773 --> 00:48:24,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">But his lawyer saw to it
that didn't last long.</font>

586
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:26,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">His lawyer, by the way,
is the recently deceased Eli Gould.</font>

587
00:48:27,155 --> 00:48:28,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Greed murder victim.
Yes, sir.</font>

588
00:48:28,907 --> 00:48:31,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna finish this thing
up today, ladies and germs.</font>

589
00:48:31,826 --> 00:48:35,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Victor's been out of circulation a while,
but there's still a residence in his name.</font>

590
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:37,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not buying all this,
are you?</font>

591
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:41,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doesn't seem like our guy, does it?
You tell me.</font>

592
00:48:42,503 --> 00:48:44,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our killer seems to
have more purpose.</font>

593
00:49:13,534 --> 00:49:14,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">You ever take a bullet?</font>

594
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:18,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never in my 34 years,
knock wood.</font>

595
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:24,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've only taken my gun out three times
with the intention of using it.</font>

596
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:25,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never pulled the trigger.</font>

597
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:27,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not once.</font>

598
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:29,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">You?</font>

599
00:49:29,217 --> 00:49:35,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but, no, I never took a bullet,
but I pulled my gun once, shot it once.</font>

600
00:49:35,556 --> 00:49:37,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Really?
It was my first one of these.</font>

601
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:39,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were a secondary unit.</font>

602
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:43,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was pretty shaky going in.
I was a rookie then.</font>

603
00:49:43,398 --> 00:49:46,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyway, we bust open the door
looking for this junkie and, uh...</font>

604
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:49,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">the fucker just
opened fire on us.</font>

605
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:51,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">One cop got hit in the arm.</font>

606
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">Christ, what was his name?</font>

607
00:49:56,786 --> 00:49:58,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">Spun him like a top.</font>

608
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:01,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know,
I mean, more like slow motion.</font>

609
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:04,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remember...</font>

610
00:50:05,753 --> 00:50:07,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">riding in that ambulance.</font>

611
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:10,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, he died right there.</font>

612
00:50:10,757 --> 00:50:12,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right there.</font>

613
00:50:12,802 --> 00:50:14,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Christ, what was his fucking name?</font>

614
00:50:27,817 --> 00:50:30,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">All rise.
Let's do it. Let's do it.</font>

615
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:34,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go, go, go. Move.</font>

616
00:50:36,701 --> 00:50:38,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

617
00:50:57,637 --> 00:50:59,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get up there.</font>

618
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:36,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">SWAT goes before dicks.</font>

619
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:37,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

620
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:41,099
<font color="#FFFFFF">They love this.</font>

621
00:51:41,681 --> 00:51:43,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">Police.</font>

00:52:28,396 --> 00:52:30,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get up, you sack of shit.</font>

630
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:38,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, fuck me.</font>

631
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:43,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dicks, you'll wanna
come take a look at this.</font>

632
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:47,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dicks!</font>

633
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:54,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oof.</font>

00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:55,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus.</font>

635
00:52:55,797 --> 00:52:57,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">Victor?

636
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, it's just Victor.</font>

637
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:01,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">Call an ambulance.
What is this?</font>

638
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:03,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hearse more like it.
Also Forensics.</font>

639
00:53:03,764 --> 00:53:05,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">California, get your people out.
Go on now.</font>

640
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:07,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one touches anything.</font>

641
00:53:07,768 --> 00:53:09,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's some frigging wax
sculpture or something.</font>

642
00:53:14,065 --> 00:53:15,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Sloth."</font>

643
00:53:24,827 --> 00:53:26,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, man.</font>

644
00:53:26,244 --> 00:53:28,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goddamn.</font>

645
00:53:28,206 --> 00:53:30,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those pictures
were dated three days ago.</font>

646
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:41,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">This must be the first one. Look.</font>

647
00:53:42,094 --> 00:53:44,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's dated exactly one
year ago today.</font>

648
00:53:46,724 --> 00:53:52,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got a hair sample, I got a stool
sample, I got piss, I got fingernails.</font>

649
00:53:54,523 --> 00:53:58,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's laughing at us.
You got what you deserved.</font>

650
00:54:01,447 --> 00:54:03,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's alive, he's alive!</font>

651
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">That cocksucker's alive!
Guns down.</font>

652
00:54:05,201 --> 00:54:08,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">Still breathing!
Guns down! Emergency on that ambulance!</font>

653
00:54:16,003 --> 00:54:17,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">Corning through.</font>

654
00:54:25,346 --> 00:54:28,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's playing games.
No shit.</font>

655
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:32,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, we have to divorce ourselves
from emotion here.</font>

656
00:54:32,311 --> 00:54:33,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

657
00:54:33,521 --> 00:54:35,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">No matter how hard it is,
we have to remain focused.</font>

658
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:37,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, man, I feed off my emotions.
How's that?</font>

659
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:40,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you listening to me?
Yes, I can hear you.</font>

660
00:54:40,987 --> 00:54:42,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me.
What are you doing?</font>

661
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:45,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">Closed crime scene, get out.
I got a right to be here.</font>

662
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:46,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">UPI photographer.
Get out.</font>

663
00:54:47,076 --> 00:54:49,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, I got a fucking right to be here.
Get out of here.</font>

664
00:54:49,996 --> 00:54:51,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out. Jesus.
Fucking jerk. Fuck you.</font>

665
00:54:52,081 --> 00:54:53,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got your picture, man.
Oh, yeah?</font>

666
00:54:53,873 --> 00:54:55,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got your picture.
Yeah?</font>

667
00:54:55,501 --> 00:54:58,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">Detective Mills,
M-I-L-L-S, fuck off.</font>

668
00:54:58,713 --> 00:55:01,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm surprised you can spell.
Fuck you.</font>

669
00:55:01,757 --> 00:55:04,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do they get here
so fucking quick?</font>

670
00:55:04,552 --> 00:55:06,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">They pay police for
the information.</font>

671
00:55:06,804 --> 00:55:07,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">And they pay well.</font>

672
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:10,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, man, I'm sorry, I...</font>

673
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:12,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those, ugh...</font>

674
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:15,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, they piss me off.
It's okay.</font>

675
00:55:15,563 --> 00:55:18,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's impressive to see a man
feeding off his emotions.</font>

676
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:27,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">A year of
immobility seems about right...</font>

677
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:30,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">judging by the deterioration
of the muscles and the spine.</font>

678
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:33,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blood tests show a whole smorgasbord
of drugs in his system.</font>

679
00:55:33,998 --> 00:55:35,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even an antibiotic...</font>

680
00:55:35,416 --> 00:55:39,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">which must've been administered
to keep the bed sores from infecting.</font>

681
00:55:39,795 --> 00:55:43,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, has he tried to speak
or communicate in any way?</font>

682
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:46,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even if his brain were not mush,
which it is...</font>

683
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:49,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">he chewed off
his own tongue long ago.</font>

684
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:53,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, Doc.</font>

685
00:55:54,018 --> 00:55:57,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">ls there absolutely no chance
that he might survive?</font>

686
00:55:57,771 --> 00:56:03,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">Detective, he'd die of shock right now if
you were to shine a flashlight in his eyes.</font>

687
00:56:03,235 --> 00:56:06,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's experienced about as much pain
and suffering as anyone I've encountered.</font>

688
00:56:06,947 --> 00:56:08,782
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give or take.</font>

689
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:12,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he still has hell
to look forward to.</font>

690
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:13,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good night.</font>

691

Tracy?</font>

696
00:56:32,181 --> 00:56:36,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is everything all right?

call you like this.</i></font>

700
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:46,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it's all right. Um...</font>

701
00:56:46,487 --> 00:56:48,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">What can I do for you, Tracy?</font>

702
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:51,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">I, uh...</font>

703
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:53,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, heh.</font>

704
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:55,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need someone to talk to.</font>

705
00:56:55,871 --> 00:56:59,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think
you could meet me somewhere...</font>

706
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:01,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">maybe tomorrow morning?</font>

707
00:57:02,168 --> 00:57:04,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't understand.</font>

709
00:57:09,135 --> 00:57:12,512
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're the only person
that I know here.</font>

710
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:14,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no one else.</font>

711
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:18,643
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>If you can, just, uh,
give me a call, okay?</i></font>

712
00:57:18,811 --> 00:57:20,813
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I have to go now.</i></font>

713
00:57:21,355 --> 00:57:23,690
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Well, good night.
Good night.</i></font>

714
00:57:32,992 --> 00:57:36,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, you know this city so well.</font>

715
00:57:36,996 --> 00:57:40,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've been here so long.</font>

716
00:57:41,876 --> 00:57:44,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">It can be a hard place.</font>

717
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:47,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know why I
asked you to come.</font>

718
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:51,177
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you talk to him about it?</font>

719
00:57:51,342 --> 00:57:53,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell him how you feel.</font>

720
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:57,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't. You know,
I can't be a burden.</font>

721
00:57:57,224 --> 00:57:59,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Especially now.</font>

722
00:58:01,061 --> 00:58:03,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll get used to things.</font>

723
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:05,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know? I think I just...</font>

724
00:58:05,356 --> 00:58:09,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanted to talk to someone who's
lived here for a long time and...</font>

725
00:58:09,987 --> 00:58:16,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, upstate, you know, it's a
completely different environment.</font>

726
00:58:18,871 --> 00:58:21,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did David tell you
that I teach fifth grade?</font>

727
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:23,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I did.</font>

728
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:27,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, he mentioned it.</font>

729
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:33,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been going around,
you know, looking at schools.</font>

730
00:58:35,429 --> 00:58:39,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the conditions
here are horrible.</font>

731
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:42,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about private schools?</font>

732
00:58:45,271 --> 00:58:47,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

733
00:58:48,275 --> 00:58:51,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you tell me
what's really bothering you, Tracy.</font>

734
00:58:53,614 --> 00:58:56,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">David and I are gonna have a baby.</font>

735
00:59:00,704 --> 00:59:02,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Tracy, I...</font>

736
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:05,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think I'm the, heh...</font>

737
00:59:05,876 --> 00:59:08,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm the one to talk to about this.</font>

738
00:59:08,336 --> 00:59:10,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hate this city.</font>

739
00:59:14,385 --> 00:59:16,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had a relationship once.</font>

740
00:59:17,304 --> 00:59:19,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was very much like a marriage.</font>

741
00:59:22,268 --> 00:59:24,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got pregnant.</font>

742
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:27,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">This was a long time ago.</font>

743
00:59:33,027 --> 00:59:36,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remember getting up one morning
and going to work.</font>

744
00:59:38,157 --> 00:59:42,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just another day like any other, except it
was the first day after I knew about...</font>

745
00:59:43,454 --> 00:59:45,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">the pregnancy.</font>

746
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:51,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I felt this fear for
the first time ever.</font>

747
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:57,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">I remember thinking how can I bring
a child into a world like this?</font>

748
00:59:57,927 --> 01:00:02,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">How can—? How can a person grow up
with all this around them?</font>

749
01:00:09,690 --> 01:00:12,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told her I didn't
want to have it.</font>

750
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:15,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">And over the next few weeks...</font>

751
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:19,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wore her down.</font>

752
01:00:21,702 --> 01:00:23,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanna have children.</font>

753
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:30,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can tell you now that...</font>

754
01:00:31,253 --> 01:00:33,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm— I know, I mean...</font>

755
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:39,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm positive
that I made the right decision.</font>

756
01:00:39,677 --> 01:00:41,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">But there's not a
day that passes...</font>

757
01:00:42,139 --> 01:00:46,601
<font color="#FFFFFF">that I don't wish
that I had made a different choice.</font>

758
01:00:49,730 --> 01:00:52,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you don't keep...</font>

759
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:57,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">The baby, I mean,
if that's your decision...</font>

760
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:01,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">don't ever tell him
that you were pregnant.</font>

761
01:01:03,202 --> 01:01:06,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if you choose to
have this baby...</font>

762
01:01:07,121 --> 01:01:10,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">you spoil that kid
every chance you get.</font>

763
01:01:17,298 --> 01:01:22,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's about all the advice
I can give you, Tracy.</font>

764
01:01:29,186 --> 01:01:30,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got to go.</font>

765
01:01:30,938 --> 01:01:32,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">William.</font>

766
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:40,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

767
01:01:54,378 --> 01:01:58,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">Victor's landlord said there was
an envelope of cash in the office mailbox...</font>

768
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:00,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">the first of every month.</font>

769
01:02:06,724 --> 01:02:10,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">"I never heard a single complaint
from the tenant in Apartment 306.</font>

770
01:02:10,351 --> 01:02:12,980

Heh.</font>

771
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:15,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's the best tenant I've
ever had," end quote.</font>

772
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:17,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, a landlord's dream.</font>

773
01:02:17,985 --> 01:02:19,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">A paralyzed tenant
with no tongue.</font>

774
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:21,447

775
01:02:22,614 --> 01:02:25,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sick of all this waiting.
This is the job.</font>

776
01:02:26,952 --> 01:02:28,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why aren't we out there, huh?</font>

777
01:02:28,454 --> 01:02:33,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do we gotta sit here rotting,
waiting till the lunatic does it again?</font>

778
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:36,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's dismissive to call him a lunatic.
Don't make that mistake.</font>

779
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:39,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, he's insane.
Look.</font>

780
01:02:39,672 --> 01:02:43,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right now he's probably dancing
around in his grandma's panties.</font>

781
01:02:43,802 --> 01:02:46,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, rubbing himself in
peanut butter. Ooh.</font>

782
01:02:47,181 --> 01:02:50,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">How's that?
I don't think so.</font>

783
01:02:50,934 --> 01:02:53,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">His luck will run out.</font>

784
01:02:54,188 --> 01:02:56,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not depending on luck.</font>

785
01:02:59,275 --> 01:03:03,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">We walked into that apartment exactly
one year after he tied Victor to the bed.</font>

786
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">One year to the day.</font>

787
01:03:05,364 --> 01:03:07,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wanted us to.
Don't know that for sure.</font>

788
01:03:07,826 --> 01:03:09,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yes, we do.</font>

789
01:03:10,369 --> 01:03:12,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">This note he left.</font>

790
01:03:12,456 --> 01:03:14,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">His first words to us.</font>

791
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:22,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck him. So what?</font>

792
01:03:22,173 --> 01:03:24,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's right, so far.</font>

793
01:03:24,217 --> 01:03:28,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">Imagine the will it takes
to keep a man bound for a full year.</font>

794
01:03:28,889 --> 01:03:32,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">To sever his hand
and use it to plant fingerprints.</font>

795
01:03:32,893 --> 01:03:35,686
<font color="#FFFFFF">To insert tubes into his genitals.</font>

796
01:03:36,103 --> 01:03:40,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">This guy is methodical, exacting,
and worst of all, patient.</font>

797
01:03:41,275 --> 01:03:43,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a nut bag.</font>

798
01:03:43,195 --> 01:03:47,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">And just because the fucker's got
a library card doesn't make him Yoda.</font>

799
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:55,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">How much money you got?
I got like 50. 50 bucks.</font>

800
01:03:55,289 --> 01:03:58,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">I propose a field trip. Come on.</font>

801
01:04:01,588 --> 01:04:02,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll make a list.</font>

802
01:04:02,755 --> 01:04:05,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">At the top we'll put <i>Purgatory,
Canterbury Tales.</i></font>

803
01:04:05,759 --> 01:04:08,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anything relating
to the seven deadly sins.</font>

804
01:04:08,554 --> 01:04:10,012
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ask yourself—
Hey, wait, wait.</font>

805
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:12,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">What would he study
to do the things he's done?</font>

806
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:15,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are his interests now?</font>

807
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:17,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jack the Ripper, for instance.</font>

808
01:04:17,603 --> 01:04:19,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are we going?
Library.</font>

809
01:04:33,619 --> 01:04:35,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">Coupons, coupons, free coupons.</font>

810

811
01:04:39,376 --> 01:04:43,630

violations during the last inspection.</font>

812
01:04:43,797 --> 01:04:48,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could you at least sit across from me?
I don't want people thinking we're dating.</font>

813
01:04:48,635 --> 01:04:50,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me your money.</font>

814
01:04:51,637 --> 01:04:55,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm giving you this, but for some reason,
I don't think I know what we're doing.</font>

815
01:04:58,478 --> 01:04:59,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck.</font>

816
01:05:00,981 --> 01:05:03,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Somerset, how you doing?
Okay.</font>

817
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:06,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">Didn't figure this was a ménage á trois.
It's not a problem.</font>

818
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:08,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sit down.</font>

819
01:05:12,826 --> 01:05:16,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only for you do I do this,
so it's a big risk.</font>

820
01:05:16,663 --> 01:05:18,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I figure we're just
fair and square.</font>

821
01:05:19,166 --> 01:05:21,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a deal.
All right.</font>

822
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:27,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">About an hour.</font>

823
01:05:28,842 --> 01:05:31,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, help yourself.</font>

824
01:05:33,096 --> 01:05:35,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that was money well spent.</font>

825
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:37,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

826
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:46,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

827
01:05:46,818 --> 01:05:50,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">By telling you this, I'm trusting
you more than I trust most people.</font>

828
01:05:50,197 --> 01:05:52,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, good,
because I'm ready to punch you.</font>

829
01:05:54,742 --> 01:05:58,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's probably nothing, but even if
it is, it's no skin off our teeth.</font>

830
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:04,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">The guy in the pizza parlor
is a friend from the Bureau.</font>

831
01:06:06,545 --> 01:06:07,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who, stinky man?</font>

832
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:12,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, for years the FBI's been hooked
into the library system, keeping records.</font>

No, monitoring reading habits.</font>

834
01:06:17,264 --> 01:06:18,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look.
What?</font>

835
01:06:18,766 --> 01:06:20,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">Certain books are flagged.</font>

836
01:06:20,811 --> 01:06:25,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">Books on, say, nuclear weapons
and, well, <i>Mein Kampf.</i></font>

837
01:06:25,565 --> 01:06:27,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anyone who checks out
a flagged book...</font>

838
01:06:27,608 --> 01:06:30,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">has his library records fed
into the FBI's computers then on.</font>

839
01:06:30,737 --> 01:06:32,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait, wait, wait,
how is this legal?</font>

840
01:06:32,905 --> 01:06:35,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, legal, illegal.
These terms don't apply.</font>

841
01:06:35,909 --> 01:06:37,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.
You—</font>

842
01:06:37,244 --> 01:06:41,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't use the information directly.
It's just a useful guide.</font>

843
01:06:41,581 --> 01:06:44,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">It might sound silly,
but you can't get a library card...</font>

844
01:06:44,418 --> 01:06:46,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">without, uh, an ID
and a current phone bill, see?</font>

845
01:06:50,257 --> 01:06:52,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">So they run a list.
Precisely.</font>

846
01:06:53,092 --> 01:06:56,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you wanna know who's reading

the FBI's computers will tell us.</font>

848
01:07:01,809 --> 01:07:03,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">It could give us a name.
It could.</font>

849
01:07:03,936 --> 01:07:07,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could get a name of some college kid
writing a term paper on 20th-century crime.</font>

01:09:42,429 --> 01:09:44,722
<font color="#FFFFFF">Police. Ls there a back way out?</font>

891
01:09:45,222 --> 01:09:46,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lock your door.</font>

892
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:51,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell is going on, man?
Get out of the fucking hall, please.</font>

893
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:18,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get down.
Aah!</font>

894
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:20,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

895
01:10:20,675 --> 01:10:22,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get the fuck down.</font>

896
01:10:51,038 --> 01:10:52,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aah!</font>

897
01:10:55,668 --> 01:10:57,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shit.</font>

898
01:10:58,671 --> 01:11:01,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get the fuck out of there.</font>

899
01:11:13,019 --> 01:11:16,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey! Shut the fuck up!</font>

900
01:11:59,106 --> 01:12:00,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goddamn it.</font>

901
01:12:10,827 --> 01:12:12,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck.</font>

902
01:13:03,046 --> 01:13:05,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out of the fucking way! Move!</font>

903
01:14:06,192 --> 01:14:08,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mills?</font>

904
01:14:09,028 --> 01:14:10,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

905
01:14:30,966 --> 01:14:32,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mills.</font>

906
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:37,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mills, you okay?
I'm all right.</font>

907
01:14:40,059 --> 01:14:41,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm all right.</font>

908
01:14:45,689 --> 01:14:47,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are you going?
I'm going in.</font>

909
01:14:47,609 --> 01:14:50,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait.</font>

910
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:52,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait.
What are you talking about?</font>

911
01:14:52,197 --> 01:14:53,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">He shot at us.
You can't.</font>

912
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:55,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">The hell we can't.
We need a warrant.</font>

913
01:14:55,699 --> 01:14:57,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got probable cause. Come on.</font>

914
01:14:57,577 --> 01:14:58,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">Think about it, think.</font>

915
01:14:58,912 --> 01:15:00,412
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did we get here?
Huh?</font>

916
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:03,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't tell anyone this, I can't tell anyone.
Oh, come on, out of the way.</font>

917
01:15:03,957 --> 01:15:05,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have no reason to be here.</font>

918
01:15:06,002 --> 01:15:07,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you listen to me?
Get off.</font>

919
01:15:07,628 --> 01:15:09,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen to me, listen.
Get the fuck off me.</font>

920
01:15:09,963 --> 01:15:11,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, all right, I'm sorry.</font>

921
01:15:11,757 --> 01:15:14,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">But would you
just pay attention a minute?</font>

922
01:15:14,426 --> 01:15:17,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we leave a hole like this,
we won't be able to prosecute.</font>

923
01:15:17,889 --> 01:15:20,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">The fucking guy will walk.
Now, is that what you want?</font>

924
01:15:20,725 --> 01:15:23,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">By the time we clear a warrant,
someone else— No, fuck that.</font>

925
01:15:23,685 --> 01:15:28,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need a reason to knock on this door.
No, no.</font>

926
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:30,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">Think about it.</font>

927
01:15:31,569 --> 01:15:33,154
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay?</font>

928
01:15:35,239 --> 01:15:37,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, man. Okay.</font>

929
01:15:37,449 --> 01:15:39,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're right.
I'm all fucked up.</font>

930
01:15:40,161 --> 01:15:42,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">When you're right, you're right.</font>

931
01:15:50,003 --> 01:15:54,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, no point in arguing anymore.</font>

932
01:15:55,217 --> 01:15:56,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unless you can fix that.</font>

933
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:01,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">You stupid son of a...</font>

934
01:16:09,774 --> 01:16:11,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">How much money we got left?</font>

935
01:16:12,527 --> 01:16:16,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, yeah, like, I noticed
this guy going out a lot.</font>

936
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:19,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">When the murders was
happening, so I, um...</font>

937
01:16:19,492 --> 01:16:21,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you called Detective
Somerset, right?</font>

938
01:16:21,994 --> 01:16:26,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, right, right, so I called the detective,
because this guy was creepy and shit.</font>

939
01:16:26,291 --> 01:16:29,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">And one of the murders,
it happened right over there.</font>

940
01:16:29,167 --> 01:16:31,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. I told you the rest. You got it?
Called the cops.</font>

941
01:16:31,962 --> 01:16:33,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good?
Got your story.</font>

942
01:16:33,171 --> 01:16:34,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have her sign. You gotta sign.
Okay.</font>

943
01:16:35,048 --> 01:16:37,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay?
Good, good, good.</font>

944
01:16:37,467 --> 01:16:40,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.
You did good.</font>

945
01:16:40,345 --> 01:16:42,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">I did what you said.
Here you go.</font>

946
01:16:42,806 --> 01:16:45,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">You get something to eat, all right?
You eat.</font>

947
01:16:48,438 --> 01:16:50,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everybody, stay outside.</font>

948
01:17:51,876 --> 01:17:53,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">Victor.</font>

949
01:20:06,385 --> 01:20:08,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somerset!</font>

950
01:20:09,846 --> 01:20:13,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">Somerset!
Yeah?</font>

951
01:20:16,770 --> 01:20:19,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?
We had him.</font>

952
01:20:19,606 --> 01:20:21,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you talking about?</font>

953
01:20:21,442 --> 01:20:24,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">The fucking photographer
in the fucking stairs.</font>

954
01:20:29,408 --> 01:20:31,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">We had him and we let him go.</font>

955
01:20:38,251 --> 01:20:39,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're sure this is him?</font>

956
01:20:39,961 --> 01:20:41,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yup, good, good.
Yup.</font>

957
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:43,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, good, get it out.
All right.</font>

958
01:20:43,256 --> 01:20:46,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, we've got nothing, no pay stubs,
no appointment books, no addresses.</font>

959
01:20:46,591 --> 01:20:48,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the best, this receipt.
Keep looking.</font>

960
01:20:48,594 --> 01:20:50,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me show you something.
This was under the bed.</font>

961
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:52,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, his only source of funds.</font>

962
01:20:52,849 --> 01:20:55,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">No kidding, we got his money.
Fucking A, I like it.</font>

963
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:56,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">One thing.
Yes?</font>

964
01:20:56,601 --> 01:20:59,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're probably not gonna believe this.
We haven't found a fingerprint yet.</font>

965
01:20:59,729 --> 01:21:03,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, not a single one.
You're right, I don't. Keep looking.</font>

966
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:09,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">We could use some
more men here.</font>

967
01:21:10,157 --> 01:21:13,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, man, I'm doing the best I can.
What are you getting with all this?</font>

968
01:21:13,743 --> 01:21:15,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are 2000 notebooks
on these shelves.</font>

969
01:21:15,912 --> 01:21:18,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">And each notebook contains
about 250 pages.</font>

970
01:21:18,957 --> 01:21:21,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forget it.
Anything about the killings?</font>

971
01:21:22,002 --> 01:21:26,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">"What sick ridiculous puppets we are,
and what a gross stage we dance on.</font>

972
01:21:26,381 --> 01:21:30,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">What fun we have dancing and
fucking. Not a care in the world.</font>

973
01:21:30,469 --> 01:21:32,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not knowing that
we are nothing.</font>

974
01:21:32,305 --> 01:21:34,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are not what was intended."</font>

975
01:21:34,724 --> 01:21:37,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, wait, there's a lot more.</font>

976
01:21:38,144 --> 01:21:41,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">"On the subway today, a man came up
to me to start a conversation.</font>

977
01:21:42,023 --> 01:21:46,152
<font color="#FFFFFF">He made small talk, a lonely man,
talking about the weather and things.</font>

978
01:21:46,319 --> 01:21:48,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">I tried to be pleasant
and accommodating.</font>

979
01:21:48,613 --> 01:21:51,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">But my head began to hurt
from his banality.</font>

980
01:21:51,573 --> 01:21:56,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">I almost didn't notice it had happened,
but I suddenly threw up all over him.</font>

981
01:21:56,828 --> 01:22:01,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was not pleased.
And I couldn't stop laughing."</font>

982
01:22:02,460 --> 01:22:03,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">No dates.</font>

983
01:22:04,127 --> 01:22:07,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">Placed on the shelves
in no discernible order.</font>

984
01:22:08,381 --> 01:22:11,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just his mind poured
out on paper.</font>

985
01:22:11,636 --> 01:22:13,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like a life's work.</font>

986
01:22:13,179 --> 01:22:16,556
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we had 50 men reading in 24-hour
shifts, it'd still take two months.</font>

987
01:22:16,724 --> 01:22:18,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know, I know, I know.</font>

988
01:22:22,563 --> 01:22:23,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's that phone?</font>

989
01:22:27,193 --> 01:22:28,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">Phone? Phone?</font>

990
01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:30,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Phone?</font>

991
01:22:32,948 --> 01:22:34,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">People, quiet.</font>

992
01:22:49,881 --> 01:22:52,717
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello?
<i>I admire you.</i></font>

993
01:22:53,551 --> 01:22:57,139
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I don't know how you found me,
but imagine my surprise.</i></font>

994
01:22:57,890 --> 01:23:01,018
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I respect you law enforcement
agents more every day.</i></font>

995
01:23:01,185 --> 01:23:04,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I appreciate that,
John.</font>

996
01:23:04,396 --> 01:23:06,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">I tell you—
<i>No, listen, all right?</i></font>

997
01:23:06,273 --> 01:23:10,360
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I'll be re-adjusting my schedule
in light of today's little setback.</i></font>

998
01:23:10,528 --> 01:23:12,947
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I just had to call and
express my admiration.</i></font>

999
01:23:13,113 --> 01:23:15,949
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Sorry I had to hurt
one of you...</i></font>

1000
01:23:16,117 --> 01:23:18,743
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>but I didn't really
have a choice, did I?</i></font>

1001
01:23:18,911 --> 01:23:20,621
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>You will accept
my apology, won't you?</i></font>

1002
01:23:20,787 --> 01:23:23,207
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I feel like saying more, but I
don't wanna ruin the surprise.</i></font>

1003
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:31,006
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>—adjusting my
schedule after today's little setback.</i></font>

1004
01:23:31,172 --> 01:23:32,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">Got it.</font>

1005
01:23:36,929 --> 01:23:38,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, everybody,
back to work.</font>

1006
01:23:40,765 --> 01:23:42,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were right.
Hmm?</font>

1007
01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:45,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ugh, he's preaching.
Yeah.</font>

1008
01:23:46,564 --> 01:23:48,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">These murders are
his sermons to us.</font>

1009
01:23:49,024 --> 01:23:52,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, we know him,
we know him, we know him.</font>

1010
01:23:55,072 --> 01:23:56,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's the blonde?</font>

1011
01:24:00,828 --> 01:24:02,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like a pro.</font>

1012
01:24:02,621 --> 01:24:04,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe.</font>

1013
01:24:04,206 --> 01:24:06,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">She caught John Doe's eye.</font>

1014
01:24:11,796 --> 01:24:14,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, he came and
collected it last night.</font>

1015
01:24:14,507 --> 01:24:16,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Last night?
Yeah.</font>

1016
01:24:16,176 --> 01:24:17,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">This man?
Yeah, John Doe.</font>

1017
01:24:17,802 --> 01:24:20,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's an easy name to remember.
He had a limp.</font>

1018
01:24:20,180 --> 01:24:23,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">What was this job you did for him?
I've got a picture of it. Hang on.</font>

1019
01:24:23,975 --> 01:24:26,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">One sweet piece, actually.</font>

1020
01:24:26,311 --> 01:24:29,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought he was one of them performance
artists, that's what I thought.</font>

1021
01:24:29,814 --> 01:24:35,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, the sort of guy that pisses in
a cup on stage and, uh, then drinks it.</font>

1022
01:24:35,738 --> 01:24:38,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">Performance art.
Hmm.</font>

1023
01:24:41,034 --> 01:24:43,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I undercharged
him, actually.</font>

1024
01:24:43,369 --> 01:24:44,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">You made this for him?</font>

1025
01:24:44,788 --> 01:24:47,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I've made weirder shit
than that. So what?</font>

1026
01:24:53,421 --> 01:24:55,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">They found the blonde.</font>

1027
01:24:58,094 --> 01:24:59,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">The picture.</font>

1028
01:24:59,677 --> 01:25:00,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">The picture.</font>

1029
01:25:02,515 --> 01:25:03,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fucking pigs.</font>

1030
01:25:06,060 --> 01:25:08,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need you to move, pal.
I'll come out, but you guys—</font>

1031
01:25:09,020 --> 01:25:12,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get the fuck out of the booth.
I've been in this cage the whole time.</font>

1032
01:25:12,524 --> 01:25:14,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay?
I'm not fucking with you.</font>

1033
01:25:14,902 --> 01:25:16,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, this way.</font>

1034
01:25:23,368 --> 01:25:25,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you do something
about this music?</font>

1035
01:25:25,328 --> 01:25:27,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, we're working on it.
We're looking for the guy.</font>

1036
01:25:40,677 --> 01:25:42,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">You from Homicide?
You—</font>

1037
01:25:42,555 --> 01:25:44,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">You better see this.
Yeah. All right.</font>

1038
01:25:46,266 --> 01:25:48,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, easy. Got him?</font>

1039
01:25:50,895 --> 01:25:53,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get this thing off of me.</font>

1040
01:25:53,606 --> 01:25:55,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God, get this thing off of me!</font>

1041
01:25:56,068 --> 01:25:57,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get this thing off of me!</font>

1042
01:25:57,819 --> 01:25:59,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get this off!
Get him out of here, now.</font>

1043
01:25:59,988 --> 01:26:01,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get him out of here, now!</font>

1044
01:26:02,867 --> 01:26:04,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, I wanna hear it again.</font>

1045
01:26:05,161 --> 01:26:08,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me again.
Just— I don't know.</font>

1046
01:26:08,788 --> 01:26:11,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">You heard nothing strange,
you saw nothing strange.</font>

1047
01:26:12,458 --> 01:26:14,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.
No.</font>

1048
01:26:15,796 --> 01:26:17,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">He asked me if I was married.</font>

1049
01:26:17,631 --> 01:26:20,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I could see he had a gun in his hand.
Where was the girl?</font>

1050
01:26:20,885 --> 01:26:23,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">The what? What?</font>

1051
01:26:23,304 --> 01:26:25,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">The girl, the prostitute.
Where was she?</font>

1052
01:26:25,972 --> 01:26:28,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone comes to
your establishment.</font>

1053
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:31,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">They want to go downstairs
and wanna get a little ooh la la.</font>

1054
01:26:31,604 --> 01:26:33,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever.</font>

1055
01:26:33,271 --> 01:26:36,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">They got to come to you, yeah?
Yeah.</font>

1056
01:26:36,817 --> 01:26:38,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">You didn't see anyone?</font>

1057
01:26:39,194 --> 01:26:42,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">With a package? A knapsack?
Something under their arm?</font>

1058
01:26:42,739 --> 01:26:46,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, everybody that comes in there's
got a package under their arms.</font>

1059
01:26:47,161 --> 01:26:50,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some guys are carrying
suitcases full of stuff.</font>

1060
01:26:50,706 --> 01:26:53,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was
just sitting on the bed.</font>

1061
01:26:59,797 --> 01:27:02,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who tied her down?
You or him?</font>

1062
01:27:02,635 --> 01:27:04,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you like what you
do for a living?</font>

1063
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:08,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">These things you see?
No.</font>

1064
01:27:09,140 --> 01:27:10,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I don't.</font>

1065
01:27:12,310 --> 01:27:14,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">But that's life, isn't it?</font>

1066
01:27:18,609 --> 01:27:24,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">He had a gun and he
made it happen.</font>

1067
01:27:26,158 --> 01:27:27,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">He made me do it.</font>

1068
01:27:28,034 --> 01:27:31,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">He put that thing on me.</font>

1069
01:27:31,704 --> 01:27:34,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he made me wear it.</font>

1070
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:38,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then he told me to fuck her.</font>

1071
01:27:39,963 --> 01:27:42,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I did. I fucked her.</font>

1072
01:27:42,966 --> 01:27:44,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God. Oh, God.</font>

1073
01:27:44,592 --> 01:27:46,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God, he had a gun in my mouth.</font>

1074
01:27:46,761 --> 01:27:50,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">The fucking gun was in my throat.</font>

1075
01:27:50,975 --> 01:27:52,016
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Fuck.</i></font>

1076
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:56,604
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Oh, God, God.</i></font>

1077
01:27:56,771 --> 01:27:59,649
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>God, help me.
Please, please, help me.</i></font>

1078
01:27:59,817 --> 01:28:01,527
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Please, please, help me.</i></font>

1079
01:28:18,836 --> 01:28:21,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, this isn't gonna
have a happy ending.</font>

1080
01:28:21,755 --> 01:28:25,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not possible.
Hey, if we catch him, I'll be happy enough.</font>

1081
01:28:27,386 --> 01:28:30,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">If we catch John Doe
and he turns out to be the devil—</font>

1082
01:28:30,264 --> 01:28:34,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, if he's Satan himself, that
might live up to our expectations...</font>

1083
01:28:34,225 --> 01:28:37,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">but he's not the devil.</font>

1084
01:28:38,730 --> 01:28:40,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's just a man.</font>

1085
01:28:41,108 --> 01:28:42,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know...</font>

1086
01:28:42,900 --> 01:28:45,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">see, you bitch and you complain
and you tell me these things.</font>

1087
01:28:47,530 --> 01:28:51,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you think you're preparing me
for hard times, thank you, but...</font>

1088
01:28:52,161 --> 01:28:54,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you gotta be a hero.</font>

1089
01:28:55,622 --> 01:28:58,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanna be a champion. Let me
tell you, people don't want a champion.</font>

1090
01:28:59,083 --> 01:29:01,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">They wanna eat cheeseburgers,
play lotto and watch TV.</font>

1091
01:29:01,753 --> 01:29:03,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did you get like this?</font>

1092
01:29:04,088 --> 01:29:06,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanna know.
Ah.</font>

1093
01:29:09,927 --> 01:29:12,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">It wasn't one thing,
I can tell you that.</font>

1094
01:29:13,974 --> 01:29:15,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go on.</font>

1095
01:29:18,479 --> 01:29:22,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just don't think I can continue to live in
a place that embraces and nurtures apathy...</font>

1096
01:29:23,108 --> 01:29:25,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">as if it was a virtue.</font>

1097
01:29:25,944 --> 01:29:27,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're no different,
no better.</font>

1098
01:29:27,779 --> 01:29:30,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't say I was different
or better. I'm not.</font>

1099
01:29:30,573 --> 01:29:33,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hell, I sympathize.
I sympathize completely.</font>

1100
01:29:33,786 --> 01:29:36,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">Apathy is a solution.</font>

1101
01:29:36,287 --> 01:29:40,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, it's easier to lose yourself
in drugs than it is to cope with life.</font>

1102
01:29:41,085 --> 01:29:43,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.
It's easier to steal what you want...</font>

1103
01:29:43,295 --> 01:29:44,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">than it is to earn it.
Yeah.</font>

1104
01:29:44,962 --> 01:29:47,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's easier to beat a child
than it is to raise it.</font>

1105
01:29:47,466 --> 01:29:50,260
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hell, love costs.
It takes effort and work.</font>

1106
01:29:50,426 --> 01:29:52,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are talking about
people who are mentally ill.</font>

1107
01:29:53,137 --> 01:29:55,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are talking about
people, fucking crazies.</font>

1108
01:29:56,015 --> 01:29:57,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No, we're not.
Yes, today.</font>

1109
01:29:57,643 --> 01:30:00,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're talking about
everyday life here.</font>

1110
01:30:02,271 --> 01:30:04,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't afford to
be this naive.</font>

1111
01:30:04,817 --> 01:30:06,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fuck off.</font>

1112
01:30:06,568 --> 01:30:10,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, you should listen
to yourself. Yeah.</font>

1113
01:30:10,988 --> 01:30:14,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">You say that the problem
with people is that they don't care.</font>

1114
01:30:15,661 --> 01:30:17,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I don't care about people.</font>

1115
01:30:17,829 --> 01:30:19,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">It makes no sense.
You know why?</font>

1116
01:30:19,832 --> 01:30:21,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, you care?
You wanna know—?</font>

1117
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn right.
And you're gonna make a difference?</font>

1118
01:30:24,670 --> 01:30:28,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever, the point is, is that I
don't think you're quitting...</font>

1119
01:30:29,132 --> 01:30:32,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">because you believe these things
you say. I don't.</font>

1120
01:30:32,511 --> 01:30:36,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think you wanna believe them
because you're quitting.</font>

1121
01:30:37,682 --> 01:30:41,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want me to agree and say,
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right.</font>

1122
01:30:41,270 --> 01:30:43,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all fucked up.
It's a fucking mess.</font>

1123
01:30:43,396 --> 01:30:46,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should all go live
in a fucking log cabin."</font>

1124
01:30:47,443 --> 01:30:49,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I won't.</font>

1125
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:51,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">I won't say that.</font>

1126
01:30:52,322 --> 01:30:55,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't agree with you.
I do not.</font>

1127
01:30:59,371 --> 01:31:00,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't.</font>

1128
01:31:10,340 --> 01:31:12,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna go home.</font>

1129
01:31:19,891 --> 01:31:21,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, though.</font>

1130
01:31:51,756 --> 01:31:53,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love you, honey.</font>

1131
01:31:54,091 --> 01:31:56,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">So much.</font>

1132
01:31:57,429 --> 01:31:59,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">So much.</font>

1133
01:32:03,726 --> 01:32:05,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know.</font>

1134
01:33:07,498 --> 01:33:10,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">911, what's your emergency?</font>

1135
01:33:10,836 --> 01:33:11,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could you repeat that?</font>

1136
01:33:12,045 --> 01:33:15,506
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I've gone and done it again.</i></font>

1137
01:33:25,559 --> 01:33:26,768
<font color="#FFFFFF">What have we got?</font>

1138
01:33:27,101 --> 01:33:29,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, sleeping pills.</font>

1139
01:33:30,104 --> 01:33:31,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">Glued to one hand.</font>

1140
01:33:31,856 --> 01:33:33,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Telephone glued to the other.</font>

1141
01:33:35,193 --> 01:33:36,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see what he did?</font>

1142
01:33:37,487 --> 01:33:38,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">He sliced her up.</font>

1143
01:33:39,488 --> 01:33:40,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then he bandaged her.</font>

1144
01:33:41,533 --> 01:33:43,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">Call for help and you'll live.</font>

1145
01:33:43,702 --> 01:33:45,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you'll be disfigured.</font>

1146
01:33:46,872 --> 01:33:49,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or you can put yourself
out of your own misery.</font>

1147
01:33:50,958 --> 01:33:52,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

1148
01:33:52,377 --> 01:33:53,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cut off her nose.</font>

1149
01:33:53,712 --> 01:33:55,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">To spite her face.</font>

1150
01:33:55,546 --> 01:33:58,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he did it very recently.</font>

1151
01:34:05,265 --> 01:34:06,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen.</font>

1152
01:34:07,391 --> 01:34:12,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've decided to stay on till this is done.
I figure one of two things will happen.</font>

1153
01:34:12,564 --> 01:34:17,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll get John Doe or he'll finish his series
of seven and this case will go on for years.</font>

1154
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:20,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey man, you don't have to do me
any favors. Thank you, but I got it.</font>

1155
01:34:20,738 --> 01:34:24,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm requesting that you keep me
on as your partner for a few more days.</font>

1156
01:34:24,242 --> 01:34:26,161
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'd be doing me a favor.</font>

1157
01:34:36,837 --> 01:34:38,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">You knew I'd say yes.</font>

1158
01:34:38,547 --> 01:34:40,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, we're here.
Wonderful.</font>

1159
01:34:40,175 --> 01:34:43,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your wife called.
Get yourself an answering machine.</font>

1160
01:34:45,805 --> 01:34:47,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">Detective?</font>

1161
01:34:48,684 --> 01:34:50,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">After this, I'm gone.</font>

1162
01:34:51,435 --> 01:34:53,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">No big surprise.
Detective!</font>

1163
01:34:56,942 --> 01:34:58,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're looking for me.</font>

1164
01:34:58,777 --> 01:34:59,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey!</font>

1165
01:35:01,154 --> 01:35:03,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you fucking move.
On the fucking floor.</font>

1166
01:35:03,782 --> 01:35:05,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep away from him!</font>

1167
01:35:05,242 --> 01:35:06,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">On the fucking floor.
I know you.</font>

1168
01:35:07,118 --> 01:35:08,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now. Get down.</font>

1169
01:35:09,203 --> 01:35:11,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get down on your stomach,
you piece of shit.</font>

1170
01:35:12,082 --> 01:35:13,958
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now. All the way!</font>

1171
01:35:14,126 --> 01:35:16,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">All the way, fucker! Down!</font>

1172
01:35:16,461 --> 01:35:19,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">Faster. Faster. Faster, fucker.</font>

1173
01:35:19,171 --> 01:35:22,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now. Nose on the ground.</font>

1174
01:35:25,261 --> 01:35:28,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus Christ.
What the fuck is this?</font>

1175
01:35:28,222 --> 01:35:31,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd like to speak to
my lawyer, please.</font>

1176
01:35:33,145 --> 01:35:35,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goddamn it.</font>

1177
01:35:36,814 --> 01:35:38,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">He cuts the skin off
the tips of his fingers.</font>

1178
01:35:39,150 --> 01:35:43,404
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why we couldn't find one
single usable print in his apartment.</font>

1179
01:35:43,572 --> 01:35:45,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like he's been doing it
for a quite sometime.</font>

1180
01:35:46,073 --> 01:35:48,493
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about the
bank accounts? The guns?</font>

1181
01:35:48,659 --> 01:35:50,494
<font color="#FFFFFF">So far
everything's a dead end.</font>

1182
01:35:50,662 --> 01:35:53,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">No credit history.
No employment records.</font>

1183
01:35:53,582 --> 01:35:57,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">His bank account's only 5 years old
and it was started with cash.</font>

1184
01:35:57,502 --> 01:35:59,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're even trying
to trace his furniture.</font>

1185
01:35:59,546 --> 01:36:01,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">About only thing we know
about that guy right now...</font>

1186
01:36:02,131 --> 01:36:06,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">is that he's independently wealthy,
well-educated and totally insane.</font>

1187
01:36:07,136 --> 01:36:09,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because he's John Doe
by choice.</font>

1188
01:36:09,305 --> 01:36:11,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, so when do we get to question him?
You don't.</font>

1189
01:36:12,016 --> 01:36:13,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">He going to court now.
What?</font>

1190
01:36:14,019 --> 01:36:16,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm telling you, there's no
way he'd turn himself in.</font>

1191
01:36:16,645 --> 01:36:18,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">It doesn't make any sense.</font>

1192
01:36:18,439 --> 01:36:22,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, there he sits.
It's not supposed to make any sense.</font>

1193
01:36:22,194 --> 01:36:24,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not finished.
No, he's pissing in our faces.</font>

1194
01:36:25,029 --> 01:36:29,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're just taking it like idiots.
You know what I'm talking about.</font>

1195
01:36:29,451 --> 01:36:33,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">For the first time ever,
you and I are in total agreement.</font>

1196
01:36:33,622 --> 01:36:37,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wouldn't just stop.
Ugh, so, what the fuck, man?</font>

1197
01:36:37,208 --> 01:36:40,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's two murders away
from completing his masterpiece.</font>

1198
01:36:41,837 --> 01:36:43,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll wait for his plea.</font>

1199
01:36:47,051 --> 01:36:51,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">My client says there are two more bodies.
Two more victims hidden away.</font>

1200
01:36:51,806 --> 01:36:54,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">He will take Detectives Mills
and Somerset to these bodies...</font>

1201
01:36:54,768 --> 01:36:58,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">but only Detective Mills and
Somerset, only at 6:00 today.</font>

1202
01:36:59,104 --> 01:37:00,689
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why us?</font>

1203
01:37:00,856 --> 01:37:02,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">He says he admires you.</font>

1204
01:37:04,069 --> 01:37:05,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's part of the game.</font>

1205
01:37:05,569 --> 01:37:08,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">The client claims if the
detectives do not accept this...</font>

1206
01:37:08,489 --> 01:37:12,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">these bodies will never be found.
Frankly, I'm inclined to let them rot.</font>

1207
01:37:12,577 --> 01:37:13,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

1208
01:37:13,994 --> 01:37:15,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've got him.</font>

1209
01:37:15,412 --> 01:37:17,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">Downstairs, locked up.
Done deal.</font>

1210
01:37:17,791 --> 01:37:20,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's gonna get his free room and
board, get his free cable TV.</font>

1211
01:37:21,002 --> 01:37:24,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hell, my wife doesn't even have cable.
Why are we having this conversation?</font>

1212
01:37:24,631 --> 01:37:27,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mills.
No. Hey, something stinks.</font>

1213
01:37:27,259 --> 01:37:28,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">And this one here—</font>

1214
01:37:28,592 --> 01:37:32,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, you, in your $3000 suit
and that smug smile on your face...</font>

1215
01:37:32,430 --> 01:37:35,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">dealing for that shit, I don't like it—
Mills.</font>

1216
01:37:35,182 --> 01:37:37,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am required by law
to serve my clients...</font>

1217
01:37:37,601 --> 01:37:39,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">to the best of my ability.
Aw, Jesus.</font>

1218
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:42,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">To serve their best interest.
We don't make deals here, Mr. Swarr.</font>

1219
01:37:43,149 --> 01:37:45,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">My client wishes inform you
if you do not accept...</font>

1220
01:37:45,734 --> 01:37:48,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">he will plead insanity
across the board.</font>

1221
01:37:48,529 --> 01:37:50,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let him try it.</font>

1222
01:37:50,364 --> 01:37:51,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd like to see him try.</font>

1223
01:37:51,658 --> 01:37:54,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, now, we all know the
extreme nature of these crimes...</font>

1224
01:37:54,828 --> 01:37:57,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could get him off
with such a plea.</font>

1225
01:37:57,413 --> 01:38:00,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not letting this conviction
slide. I can tell you that.</font>

1226
01:38:00,292 --> 01:38:03,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">He says that if you do accept
under his specific conditions...</font>

1227
01:38:04,087 --> 01:38:06,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">he'll sign a full confession,
plead guilty right now.</font>

1228
01:38:07,090 --> 01:38:09,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's your case.
Make a decision.</font>

1229
01:38:11,094 --> 01:38:12,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Full confession.</font>

1230
01:38:12,887 --> 01:38:15,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm in.
It has to be the both of you.</font>

1231
01:38:17,141 --> 01:38:22,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">If he were to claim insanity,
this conversation is admissible.</font>

1232
01:38:22,771 --> 01:38:25,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">The fact that he's blackmailing us
with his plea.</font>

1233
01:38:25,190 --> 01:38:27,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">And my client would like to
remind you two more are dead.</font>

1234
01:38:27,985 --> 01:38:29,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">Press would have a field day...</font>

1235
01:38:29,654 --> 01:38:32,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">if they find out the police
didn't seem concerned about them.</font>

1236
01:38:32,782 --> 01:38:35,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">Giving them a proper burial.
If in fact there are two more dead.</font>

1237
01:38:36,161 --> 01:38:40,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lab report came up from downtown. They
did a quickie on Doe's clothing and nails.</font>

1238
01:38:40,497 --> 01:38:44,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">They found blood from Doe.
From him slicing his fingers.</font>

1239
01:38:44,168 --> 01:38:46,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">Blood from the woman
who's face he cut off.</font>

1240
01:38:46,962 --> 01:38:51,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">And blood from a third party,
as yet unidentified.</font>

1241
01:38:54,887 --> 01:38:56,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'd be escorting an
unarmed man.</font>

1242
01:39:00,018 --> 01:39:01,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's finish it.</font>

1243
01:39:05,105 --> 01:39:08,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">If John Doe's head splits
open and a UFO should fly out...</font>

1244
01:39:08,525 --> 01:39:11,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to have expected it.</font>

1245
01:39:12,697 --> 01:39:14,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">I Will.</font>

1246
01:39:16,659 --> 01:39:18,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, man, if I was to accidentally
shave off a nipple...</font>

1247
01:39:19,078 --> 01:39:20,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">would it be covered
by workman's comp?</font>

1248
01:39:20,872 --> 01:39:21,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

1249
01:39:26,086 --> 01:39:28,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">I suppose so.</font>

1250
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:30,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.
If you were man enough...</font>

1251
01:39:30,547 --> 01:39:34,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">to actually file a claim,
I'd buy you one out of my own pocket.</font>

1252
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:38,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I keep coming home late, my
wife's gonna think something's up.</font>

1253
01:39:48,065 --> 01:39:49,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know...</font>

1254
01:39:50,734 --> 01:39:52,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

1255
01:39:57,867 --> 01:39:59,159
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

1256
01:41:10,774 --> 01:41:11,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go.</font>

1257
01:41:42,430 --> 01:41:44,849
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>C-Victor -5-5 take. Clear the TC.</i></font>

1258
01:41:45,015 --> 01:41:46,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pull around.</font>

1259
01:41:47,685 --> 01:41:50,771
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>There it is. Late-model black
sedan at your 10 o'clock.</i></font>

1260
01:42:00,030 --> 01:42:01,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are you, John?</font>

1261
01:42:02,283 --> 01:42:04,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are you really?</font>

1262
01:42:04,368 --> 01:42:05,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you mean?</font>

1263
01:42:05,619 --> 01:42:09,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">At this stage, what harm can it do
to tell us a bit about yourself?</font>

1264
01:42:09,873 --> 01:42:13,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">It doesn't matter who I am.
Who I am means absolutely nothing.</font>

1265
01:42:13,211 --> 01:42:15,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need to stay on
your left up here.</font>

1266
01:42:19,384 --> 01:42:21,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">So where are we heading?</font>

1267
01:42:21,761 --> 01:42:22,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll see.</font>

1268
01:42:23,555 --> 01:42:27,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not just going to pick up
two more dead bodies, are we, John?</font>

1269
01:42:27,559 --> 01:42:29,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">That wouldn't be shocking enough.</font>

1270
01:42:29,601 --> 01:42:32,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've got newspapers
to think about, yeah?</font>

1271
01:42:33,814 --> 01:42:36,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wanting people to listen...</font>

1272
01:42:36,192 --> 01:42:39,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">you can't just tap them
on the shoulder anymore.</font>

1273
01:42:39,904 --> 01:42:42,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have to hit them
with a sledgehammer.</font>

1274
01:42:42,448 --> 01:42:45,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then you'll notice
you've got their strict attention.</font>

1275
01:42:45,577 --> 01:42:47,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the question is:</font>

1276
01:42:47,619 --> 01:42:50,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">What makes you so special
that people should listen?</font>

1277
01:42:50,832 --> 01:42:51,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not special.</font>

1278
01:42:53,083 --> 01:42:55,587
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>I've never been exceptional.</i></font>

1279
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:59,591
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>This is, though, what I'm doing.
My work.</i></font>

1280
01:43:00,048 --> 01:43:01,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your work, John?</font>

1281
01:43:01,926 --> 01:43:03,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

1282
01:43:03,219 --> 01:43:06,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, I don't— I don't see
anything special about it, John.</font>

1283
01:43:07,599 --> 01:43:08,640
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not true.</font>

1284
01:43:08,807 --> 01:43:09,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it is true.</font>

1285
01:43:10,059 --> 01:43:13,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the funny thing is,
all this work...</font>

1286
01:43:13,395 --> 01:43:15,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">two months from now,
no one's gonna care.</font>

1287
01:43:15,564 --> 01:43:17,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one's gonna give a shit,
no one's gonna remember.</font>

1288
01:43:18,067 --> 01:43:21,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't see the whole
complete act yet.</font>

1289
01:43:21,863 --> 01:43:23,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">But when this is done...</font>

1290
01:43:24,782 --> 01:43:26,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">when it's finished...</font>

1291
01:43:27,952 --> 01:43:29,453
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's going to be...</font>

1292
01:43:32,457 --> 01:43:35,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">People will barely be able
to comprehend.</font>

1293
01:43:35,960 --> 01:43:38,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">But they won't be able to deny.</font>

1294
01:43:39,631 --> 01:43:41,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could the freak be more vague?</font>

1295
01:43:42,257 --> 01:43:44,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, as far as master
plans go, John—</font>

1296
01:43:44,676 --> 01:43:48,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't wait for you to see. I really can't.
It's really going to be something.</font>

1297
01:43:49,599 --> 01:43:52,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you know what?
I'm gonna be standing next to you.</font>

1298
01:43:52,476 --> 01:43:55,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">So when this big thing happens,
you be sure and let me know.</font>

1299
01:43:55,896 --> 01:43:59,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I wouldn't wanna miss it.
Oh, don't worry.</font>

1300
01:43:59,567 --> 01:44:00,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">You won't.</font>

1301
01:44:02,612 --> 01:44:04,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">You won't miss a thing.</font>

1302
01:44:11,328 --> 01:44:14,623
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>With the tour bus
itself, give two miles separation.</i></font>

1303
01:44:31,390 --> 01:44:32,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's so exciting?</font>

1304
01:44:33,935 --> 01:44:35,853
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not too far now.</font>

1305
01:44:39,564 --> 01:44:41,317
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>High-tension lines ahead.</i></font>

1306
01:44:41,484 --> 01:44:42,652
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Prepare for
frequency change.</i></font>

1307
01:44:43,278 --> 01:44:45,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've been trying to figure
something in my head.</font>

1308
01:44:45,738 --> 01:44:48,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">And maybe you can help
me out, yeah?</font>

1309
01:44:49,533 --> 01:44:53,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">When a person is insane,
as you clearly are...</font>

1310
01:44:53,871 --> 01:44:56,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">do you know that
you're insane?</font>

1311
01:44:56,373 --> 01:44:58,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe you're sitting around,
reading Guns and Ammo...</font>

1312
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:02,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">masturbating in your own feces,
do you just stop and go:</font>

fucking crazy I really am"?</font>

1314
01:45:06,216 --> 01:45:08,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah?
Do you guys do that?</font>

1315
01:45:09,386 --> 01:45:12,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's more comfortable
for you to label me insane.</font>

1316
01:45:12,222 --> 01:45:13,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's very comfortable.</font>

1317
01:45:14,225 --> 01:45:17,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not something I would
expect you to accept.</font>

1318
01:45:17,936 --> 01:45:20,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I did not choose.
I was chosen.</font>

1319
01:45:21,149 --> 01:45:24,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, whatever.
I don't doubt that you believe that, John.</font>

1320
01:45:25,319 --> 01:45:29,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">But seems to me that you're
overlooking a glaring contradiction.</font>

1321
01:45:29,573 --> 01:45:30,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">Meaning what?</font>

1322
01:45:32,034 --> 01:45:33,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">Glad you asked.</font>

1323
01:45:35,287 --> 01:45:36,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you were chosen...</font>

1324
01:45:37,081 --> 01:45:40,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">that is, by a higher power...</font>

1325
01:45:41,668 --> 01:45:43,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">and if your hand was forced...</font>

1326
01:45:44,087 --> 01:45:47,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">it seems strange to me that you'd
get such enjoyment out of it.</font>

1327
01:45:47,841 --> 01:45:50,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">You enjoyed torturing
those people.</font>

1328
01:45:51,429 --> 01:45:54,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">This doesn't seem in keeping
with martyrdom, does it?</font>

1329
01:45:56,100 --> 01:45:57,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">John?</font>

1330
01:46:02,148 --> 01:46:05,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">I doubt I enjoyed it any
more than Detective Mills...</font>

1331
01:46:05,193 --> 01:46:08,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">would enjoy time alone with me
in a room without windows.</font>

1332
01:46:09,488 --> 01:46:11,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">Isn't that true?</font>

1333
01:46:11,615 --> 01:46:14,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">How happy would it make you
to hurt me with impunity.</font>

1334
01:46:14,702 --> 01:46:15,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">That hurts my feelings.</font>

1335
01:46:17,372 --> 01:46:20,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would never—
You wouldn't because there's consequences.</font>

1336
01:46:22,042 --> 01:46:24,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's in those eyes
of yours, though.</font>

1337
01:46:24,837 --> 01:46:27,506
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing wrong with a man
taking pleasure in his work.</font>

1338
01:46:28,256 --> 01:46:33,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">I won't deny my own personal desire
to turn each sin against the sinner.</font>

1339
01:46:34,180 --> 01:46:37,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait a minute, I thought all you
did was kill innocent people.</font>

1340
01:46:39,435 --> 01:46:42,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">Innocent?
Is that supposed to be funny?</font>

1341
01:46:42,896 --> 01:46:44,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">An obese man.</font>

1342
01:46:44,524 --> 01:46:47,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">A disgusting man who
could barely stand up.</font>

1343
01:46:47,193 --> 01:46:51,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you saw him, you'd point him out to your
friends so they'd join you in mocking him.</font>

1344
01:46:51,655 --> 01:46:53,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">A man, who if you saw him
while you were eating...</font>

1345
01:46:54,117 --> 01:46:56,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">you wouldn't be able
to finish your meal.</font>

1346
01:46:56,953 --> 01:47:00,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">And after him, lawyer. You must've
secretly been thanking me for that one.</font>

1347
01:47:00,997 --> 01:47:03,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a man who
dedicated his life...</font>

1348
01:47:04,085 --> 01:47:08,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">to making money by lying with
every breath that he could muster...</font>

1349
01:47:08,881 --> 01:47:11,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">to keeping murderers and
rapists on the streets.</font>

1350
01:47:11,926 --> 01:47:13,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">Murderers?
A woman.</font>

1351
01:47:13,511 --> 01:47:15,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Murderers, John, like yourself?
A woman...</font>

1352
01:47:15,762 --> 01:47:18,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">so ugly inside that she
couldn't bear to go on living...</font>

1353
01:47:18,640 --> 01:47:20,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">if she couldn't be
beautiful on the outside?</font>

1354
01:47:21,101 --> 01:47:25,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">A drug dealer. A drug
dealing pederast, actually.</font>

1355
01:47:25,689 --> 01:47:28,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">And let's not forget
the disease-spreading whore.</font>

1356
01:47:30,610 --> 01:47:33,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only in a world this shitty...</font>

1357
01:47:33,197 --> 01:47:36,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">could you try to say these were
innocent people and keep a straight face.</font>

1358
01:47:40,121 --> 01:47:41,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">But that's the point.</font>

1359
01:47:43,166 --> 01:47:46,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">We see a deadly sin
on every street corner...</font>

1360
01:47:46,377 --> 01:47:49,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">in every home and we tolerate it.</font>

1361
01:47:49,921 --> 01:47:52,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">We tolerate it
because it's common, it's...</font>

1362
01:47:52,841 --> 01:47:54,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's trivial.</font>

1363
01:47:54,676 --> 01:47:57,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">We tolerate it morning,
noon and night.</font>

1364
01:48:00,725 --> 01:48:02,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, not anymore.</font>

1365
01:48:04,895 --> 01:48:07,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm setting the example.</font>

1366
01:48:08,274 --> 01:48:09,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what I've done is gonna be...</font>

1367
01:48:10,150 --> 01:48:11,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">puzzled over...</font>

1368
01:48:12,069 --> 01:48:13,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">and studied...</font>

1369
01:48:14,697 --> 01:48:16,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">and followed...</font>

1370
01:48:17,908 --> 01:48:18,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">forever.</font>

1371
01:48:19,743 --> 01:48:21,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

1372
01:48:22,412 --> 01:48:24,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">Delusions of grandeur.</font>

1373
01:48:25,625 --> 01:48:27,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should be thanking me.</font>

1374
01:48:27,918 --> 01:48:29,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why's that, John?</font>

1375
01:48:29,295 --> 01:48:32,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because you're going
to be remembered after this.</font>

1376
01:48:32,590 --> 01:48:36,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">Realize, detective, the only reason
that I'm here right now...</font>

1377
01:48:36,594 --> 01:48:38,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">is that I wanted to be.</font>

1378
01:48:38,804 --> 01:48:41,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. No, we would've
got you eventually.</font>

1379
01:48:41,474 --> 01:48:42,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, really?</font>

1380
01:48:42,934 --> 01:48:47,188
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, what were you doing,
biding your time? Toying with me?</font>

1381
01:48:47,771 --> 01:48:53,194
<font color="#FFFFFF">Allowing five innocent people to die
until you felt like springing your trap?</font>

1382
01:48:53,360 --> 01:48:57,448
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me, what was the indisputable
evidence you were going to use on me...</font>

1383
01:48:57,614 --> 01:49:02,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">right before I walked up to you
and put my hands in the air?</font>

1384
01:49:02,244 --> 01:49:04,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">John, calm down.</font>

1385
01:49:04,622 --> 01:49:06,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">I seem to remember us
knocking on your door.</font>

1386
01:49:07,332 --> 01:49:09,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, that's right.</font>

1387
01:49:09,335 --> 01:49:12,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I seem to remember
breaking your face.</font>

1388
01:49:17,426 --> 01:49:20,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're only alive because
I didn't kill you.</font>

1389
01:49:20,429 --> 01:49:22,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, sit back.
I spared you.</font>

1390
01:49:22,556 --> 01:49:23,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sit back.</font>

1391
01:49:23,765 --> 01:49:26,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember that every time
you look in the mirror...</font>

1392
01:49:26,226 --> 01:49:28,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">at that face of yours
for the rest of your life...</font>

1393
01:49:29,104 --> 01:49:30,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">or should I say for the rest...</font>

1394
01:49:30,939 --> 01:49:33,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">of what life I allow you to have.
Sit back.</font>

1395
01:49:33,484 --> 01:49:37,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sit back, you fucking freak.
Shut your fucking mouth.</font>

1396
01:49:38,698 --> 01:49:41,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're no messiah.
You're a movie of the week.</font>

1397
01:49:41,617 --> 01:49:45,203
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a fucking T-shirt at best.</font>

1398
01:49:58,301 --> 01:50:00,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't ask me to pity
those people.</font>

1399
01:50:00,720 --> 01:50:02,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't mourn them any more...</font>

1400
01:50:02,305 --> 01:50:04,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">than the thousands that died
at Sodom and Gomorrah.</font>

1401
01:50:05,181 --> 01:50:09,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that to say, John, that what you
were doing was God's good work?</font>

1402
01:50:12,898 --> 01:50:16,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Lord works in
mysterious ways.</font>

1403
01:50:18,112 --> 01:50:20,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you see those
high-tension towers?</font>

1404
01:50:20,698 --> 01:50:23,033
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>That's where we're headed.</i>
<i>I see where.</i></font>

1405
01:50:23,199 --> 01:50:25,536
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Right to your 9 o'clock</i>
<i>and follow that access road.</i></font>

1406
01:50:31,876 --> 01:50:34,045
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Your signal's
breaking up, Viking.</i></font>

1407
01:50:34,211 --> 01:50:37,672
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Un-fucking-avoidable, Center.</i>
<i>We're in power-line city, deal with it.</i></font>

1408
01:50:39,175 --> 01:50:42,011
<font color="#FFFFFF">This sure as shit is no
ambush out here.</font>

1409
01:50:42,177 --> 01:50:44,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">No fucking nothing out here.
Can't land anywhere near.</font>

1410
01:50:45,096 --> 01:50:47,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're gonna be coming up
behind us in about two minutes.</font>

1411
01:50:48,100 --> 01:50:50,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to go up,
way up.</font>

1412
01:50:50,519 --> 01:50:53,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thirty seconds, bank east
on my mark. Thirty seconds.</font>

1413
01:51:55,710 --> 01:51:57,461
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm getting him out.</font>

1414
01:51:59,546 --> 01:52:01,631
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Target is now fully into standby.</i></font>

1415
01:52:02,466 --> 01:52:03,466
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Got you in sight.</i></font>

1416
01:52:03,634 --> 01:52:05,051
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Get out.</i></font>

1417
01:52:05,594 --> 01:52:07,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Slowly.</font>

1418
01:52:07,721 --> 01:52:09,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop.</font>

1419
01:52:09,765 --> 01:52:11,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay.</font>

1420
01:52:14,060 --> 01:52:15,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you got?</font>

1421
01:52:16,896 --> 01:52:18,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dead dog.</font>

1422
01:52:19,942 --> 01:52:21,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't do that.</font>

1423
01:52:25,155 --> 01:52:27,323
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>We're holdin on standby, copy?</i></font>

1424
01:52:28,324 --> 01:52:29,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">What time is it?</font>

1425
01:52:30,327 --> 01:52:32,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?
I'd like to know.</font>

1426
01:52:36,292 --> 01:52:37,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seven-oh-one.</font>

1427
01:52:40,671 --> 01:52:41,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's close.</font>

1428
01:52:42,840 --> 01:52:44,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go take a look.</font>

1429
01:52:47,761 --> 01:52:48,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's this way.</font>

1430
01:52:51,849 --> 01:52:53,893
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Bird 2, close your distance.</i></font>

1431
01:52:54,059 --> 01:52:56,604
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>This is Bird 2.
They're away from the car.</i></font>

1432
01:52:56,770 --> 01:52:58,939
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Coming in closer.</i></font>

1433
01:53:00,815 --> 01:53:04,194
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>We got them.
We got them. Closing in.</i></font>

1434
01:53:04,360 --> 01:53:05,988
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Negative.
Negative. Hold your go.</i></font>

1435
01:53:31,971 --> 01:53:33,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mills?</font>

1436
01:53:37,310 --> 01:53:40,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Down, down, down.</font>

1437
01:53:41,356 --> 01:53:42,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">Watch him.</font>

1438
01:53:44,109 --> 01:53:45,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">There he goes.</font>

1439
01:53:46,153 --> 01:53:48,322
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>It's good we
have some time to talk.</i></font>

1440
01:53:52,408 --> 01:53:53,828
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Van approaching.</i></font>

1441
01:53:53,993 --> 01:53:57,413

the crosshairs off the guy in red.</font>

1442
01:54:02,043 --> 01:54:04,671
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>He's going out to meet
the van. Just stay down.</i></font>

1443
01:54:05,130 --> 01:54:08,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a van coming down the road.
From the north.</font>

1444
01:54:17,475 --> 01:54:20,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be ready for anything, now.
Wait for my signal.</font>

1445
01:54:20,229 --> 01:54:21,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait for me.</font>

1446
01:54:27,278 --> 01:54:29,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out of the van!</font>

1447
01:54:30,738 --> 01:54:31,782
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Out!</i></font>

1448
01:54:31,948 --> 01:54:34,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus Christ, man. Don't shoot me.</font>

1449
01:54:34,284 --> 01:54:35,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">Step away.</font>

1450
01:54:36,412 --> 01:54:38,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">Turn around.
Put your hands on your head.</font>

1451
01:54:38,788 --> 01:54:40,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell is going on?</font>

1452
01:54:41,125 --> 01:54:43,918
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>What are you doing here?</i>
I'm delivering a package.</font>

1453
01:54:44,086 --> 01:54:45,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got this package for
this guy, David.</font>

1454
01:54:45,962 --> 01:54:49,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh, Detective David Mills.</font>

1455
01:54:56,222 --> 01:54:58,559
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get it.
Slowly.</font>

1456
01:54:59,435 --> 01:55:01,979
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Stay alert.
He's opening the back of the van.</i></font>

<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>We've got him in sight.</i></font>

1458
01:55:10,069 --> 01:55:13,323
<font color="#FFFFFF">This guy paid me 500 bucks
to bring it out here, man.</font>

1459
01:55:13,489 --> 01:55:15,576
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said he wanted it here
at exactly 7:00.</font>

1460
01:55:16,327 --> 01:55:17,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put it down.</font>

1461
01:55:18,453 --> 01:55:19,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">We got a box.</font>

1462
01:55:19,954 --> 01:55:24,251

I need a bomb squad. We got a box.</font>

01:55:24,710 --> 01:55:26,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Face the van.</font>

1464
01:55:26,795 --> 01:55:28,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hands up.</font>

1465
01:55:35,679 --> 01:55:37,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">Turn around.</font>

1466
01:55:38,181 --> 01:55:40,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. Go.
Off you go. Go.</font>

1467
01:55:40,266 --> 01:55:42,394
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Do you want us
to pick this guy up?</i></font>

1468
01:55:43,311 --> 01:55:45,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sending the driver
out on foot.</font>

1469
01:55:48,192 --> 01:55:52,154
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Got the driver in sight.</i>
He's headed north. Have him picked up.</font>

1470
01:56:01,412 --> 01:56:03,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I don't know.</font>

1471
01:56:09,546 --> 01:56:11,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna open it.</font>

1472
01:56:11,215 --> 01:56:15,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I said I admired you,
I meant what I said.</font>

1473
01:56:33,737 --> 01:56:34,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's blood.</font>

1474
01:56:34,988 --> 01:56:36,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've made
quite a life for yourself.</font>

1475
01:56:36,907 --> 01:56:37,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

1476
01:56:38,117 --> 01:56:41,244
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should be very proud.
Shut the fuck up, you piece of shit.</font>

1477
01:56:54,925 --> 01:56:56,342
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Someone lost contact, copy.</i></font>

1478
01:57:08,939 --> 01:57:10,399
<font color="#FFFFFF">California,
stay away from here.</font>

1479
01:57:10,565 --> 01:57:13,027
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay away from here, now.
Don't come in here.</font>

1480
01:57:13,484 --> 01:57:15,194
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Whatever you hear,
stay away.</i></font>

1481
01:57:16,404 --> 01:57:19,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">John Doe has the upper hand.
Mills!</font>

1482
01:57:19,908 --> 01:57:21,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here he comes.</font>

1483
01:57:21,201 --> 01:57:23,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">Throw your gun down!
What?</font>

1484
01:57:23,244 --> 01:57:25,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish I could've lived like you.
Shut up.</font>

1485
01:57:25,622 --> 01:57:28,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the fuck you talking about?
Go away!</font>

1486
01:57:28,583 --> 01:57:29,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you hear me, detective?</font>

1487
01:57:30,043 --> 01:57:34,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm trying to tell you how much
I admire you and your pretty wife.</font>

1488
01:57:35,466 --> 01:57:37,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?
Tracy.</font>

1489
01:57:37,467 --> 01:57:38,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mills!</font>

1490
01:57:38,844 --> 01:57:39,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">What'd you fucking say?</font>

1491
01:57:40,095 --> 01:57:44,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's disturbing how easily a member of
the press can purchase information...</font>

1492
01:57:44,349 --> 01:57:46,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">from the men in your precinct.</font>

1493
01:57:46,560 --> 01:57:48,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the fuck?</font>

1494
01:57:48,479 --> 01:57:50,354
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Throw your gun down!</i></font>

1495
01:57:50,521 --> 01:57:52,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">I visited your home this morning...</font>

1496
01:57:53,567 --> 01:57:55,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">After you'd left.</font>

1497
01:57:55,527 --> 01:57:57,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mills!
I tried to play husband.</font>

1498
01:57:58,322 --> 01:58:01,574
<font color="#FFFFFF">I tried to taste the
life of a simple man.</font>

1499
01:58:01,783 --> 01:58:03,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">Throw it away!</font>

1500
01:58:03,202 --> 01:58:05,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tsk, it didn't work out.</font>

1501
01:58:05,662 --> 01:58:07,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">So...</font>

1502
01:58:07,497 --> 01:58:09,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">I took a souvenir.</font>

1503
01:58:11,042 --> 01:58:12,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her pretty head.</font>

1504
01:58:12,920 --> 01:58:14,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mills.</font>

1505
01:58:15,046 --> 01:58:16,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mills.</font>

1506
01:58:17,673 --> 01:58:18,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's he talking about?</font>

1507
01:58:19,009 --> 01:58:21,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me your gun.
What's going on over there?</font>

1508
01:58:21,552 --> 01:58:22,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put the, ugh—
Put the gun down.</font>

1509
01:58:23,012 --> 01:58:25,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw you with a box.
What was in the box?</font>

1510
01:58:25,181 --> 01:58:28,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I envy your normal life.
Put the gun down, David.</font>

1511
01:58:28,268 --> 01:58:31,229
<font color="#FFFFFF">It seems that envy is my sin.
Oh, what's in the box?</font>

1512
01:58:31,395 --> 01:58:33,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not until you give me the gun.
What's in the box?</font>

1513
01:58:33,899 --> 01:58:35,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me the gun.
He just told you.</font>

1514
01:58:35,818 --> 01:58:39,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">You lie. You're a fucking liar, shut up.
David.</font>

1515
01:58:39,613 --> 01:58:42,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what he wants.
He wants you to shoot him.</font>

1516
01:58:42,533 --> 01:58:45,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">No! No.</font>

1517
01:58:46,036 --> 01:58:47,829
<font color="#FFFFFF">You tell me that's not true.</font>

1518
01:58:47,996 --> 01:58:50,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not true.
Become vengeance, David.</font>

1519
01:58:50,289 --> 01:58:53,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, she's all right. You tell me.
Become...</font>

1520
01:58:53,335 --> 01:58:55,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">wrath.
Tell me she's all right!</font>

1521
01:58:56,003 --> 01:58:58,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you murder a suspect, David—
No.</font>

1522
01:58:58,297 --> 01:59:00,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">You throw
it all away, he knows it.</font>

1523
01:59:00,216 --> 01:59:01,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">No!</font>

1524
01:59:01,385 --> 01:59:03,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">She begged for her life.
Shut up.</font>

1525
01:59:03,554 --> 01:59:07,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">She begged for her life and for
the life of the baby inside of her.</font>

1526
01:59:23,282 --> 01:59:24,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

1527
01:59:26,577 --> 01:59:27,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">He didn't know.</font>

1528
01:59:41,757 --> 01:59:43,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me the gun, David.</font>

1529
01:59:48,681 --> 01:59:50,184
<font color="#FFFFFF">David.</font>

1530
01:59:51,475 --> 01:59:52,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you kill him...</font>

1531
01:59:54,395 --> 01:59:56,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">he will win.</font>

1532
01:59:59,859 --> 02:00:01,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God.</font>

1533
02:00:01,862 --> 02:00:04,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, God.</font>

1534
02:00:04,780 --> 02:00:05,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh!</font>

1535
02:00:19,378 --> 02:00:21,131
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, fuck, he shot him.</font>

1536
02:00:43,237 --> 02:00:45,822
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Set it down somewhere.</i></font>

1537
02:00:47,032 --> 02:00:49,326
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Come on, set us down.</i></font>

Somebody call somebody.</i></font>

1539

<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Call somebody.</i></font>

1540
02:01:12,015 --> 02:01:15,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we'll take care of him.</font>

1541
02:01:23,734 --> 02:01:25,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever he needs.</font>

1542
02:01:26,697 --> 02:01:28,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are you gonna be?</font>

1543
02:01:30,908 --> 02:01:32,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Around.</font>

1544
02:01:36,622 --> 02:01:38,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll be around.</font>

1545
02:01:42,421 --> 02:01:44,672
<font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Ernest Hemingway once wrote:</i></font>
