You turned on the TV. I went over,</font>

188
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:55,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">said, "No TV, no TV, no TV."
Turned it off.</font>

189
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Came over here.</font>

190
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,800

- Knocked over the phone.</font>

191
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right, knocked over the phone.
Put it back.</font>

192
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,700

going to call their moms, too, all right?</font>

207
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're just going to lie about it.</font>

208
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, and eat junk food 'cause this is
your one chance, but brush your teeth.</font>

293
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">it says here he was a little more,
I guess you'd say, ambitious than you.</font>

that stuff means. Do you?</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Cadet wing commander, valedictorian,
plum job in the Public Affairs...</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, no, I know what he did, sir.</font>

299
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why'd you drop out of school, Jerry?</font>

300
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did your brother have
any influence on that decision?</font>

301
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, school just wasn't for me.</font>

302
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I mean, who would want
a Stanford education anyway?</font>

303
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">More upward mobility
at Copy Cabana, I guess, right?</font>

304

Singapore, Bali, Indonesia.</font>

So you've been around.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, none of this has anything to do</font>

307
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">with any of the shit
that was in my apartment.</font>

308
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why would I send it to myself?
My name is on the lease.</font>

309
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd have to be the dumbest terrorist
in the history of the world.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">The...
I don't know who deposited the 750!</font>

313
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">I took the money. That was my mistake.
It was an accident.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Do accidents not happen
in your universe?</font>

315
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:07,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, the money originated
from the YTBC Bank of...</font>

316
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,900

a corporation called The Star of Orion,</font>

- This is all very interesting, sir.</font>

- We find hardware in your apartment.</font>

of ammonium nitrate fertilizer.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">You planning on becoming
a farmer or something?</font>

325
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">I walk into my apartment,
I open the door,</font>

326
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">and this shit's all over my apartment.</font>

327
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It just showed up.
- It just showed up.</font>

328
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see. I'm just curious
if your brother knew anything about it.</font>

329
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course, we haven't really established
how close you guys were yet, have we?</font>

330
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we were pretty close this morning
when I buried his body in the ground.</font>

331
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does that establish anything for you?
Somebody set me up.</font>

332
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why is that so hard
for you to understand?</font>

333
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">- "Somebody."
- A woman called me on the phone.</font>

334
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">She told me I was going to be arrested.</font>

335
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">"A woman." Your mom? Who?</font>

336
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:54,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know! If I knew, I would tell you!
I don't know!</font>

337
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's the thing, Jerry.</font>

338
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a bad time to be
in the terrorism business.</font>

339
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">You read the paper.</font>

340
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who do you think is winning?</font>

341
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:13,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your Miranda rights or my right to keep
you in this room as long as I want to?</font>

342
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care if you tell me
the truth about your brother.</font>

343
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't care who you work for.</font>

344
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:24,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">'Cause no matter what you tell me,
you're in a shitload of trouble, son.</font>

345
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is insane. I work for Copy Cabana.</font>

346
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, that's what you said.</font>

347
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, I get one night out
in a decade, ladies,</font>

348
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am not wasting it on Lemon Drops.</font>

349
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay.
- Buck up. Let's go.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, gosh.</font>

351
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,700
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want updates. Catfights, booty calls,
somebody tell me they got lucky.</font>

352
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:04,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, ladies. See that guy over there?
He'd like to buy you a round.</font>

353
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:07,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hell, no.
He's got light beer written all over him.</font>

354
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">- He's cute.
- Come on.</font>

355
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's a suit. No.</font>

356
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">You sure?</font>

357
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Come on.
- Who is it?</font>

358
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:16,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">The one man in my life
who hasn't let me down.</font>

- All right, don't drink those without me.</font>

something I can read?</font>

404
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you suggesting
that he was overqualified?</font>

405
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or that he was somehow slipping intel
to the Copy Cabana?</font>

406
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,300

that maybe Ethan Shaw</font>

who did go wrong,</font>

because I'm the goddamn suspect.</font>

568
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:53,800

- <i>Yeah.</i></font>

597
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:45,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, then this whole thing's
obviously gotta be about your brother.</font>

598
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Really, it's that obvious, huh?
- I mean, you got all this stuff.</font>

599
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">The weapons, the cash,
the airplane manuals.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay.
- He was your twin.</font>

601
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:51,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">- They sent it to the wrong brother.
- Right.</font>

602
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you're implying
my brother's a terrorist.</font>

603
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:55,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm implying, if not him, then why you?</font>

604
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry. I know he just died. I'm not
trying to insult his memory or anything.</font>

605
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, he hasn't been dead long enough
to be a memory, Rachel.</font>

606
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you knew my brother,
you'd laugh all day at the idea</font>

607
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">that he was a terrorist or a spy
or whatever else you're saying...</font>

608
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How do you know?
- Because he's my brother.</font>

609
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:13,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's something you would know
about your brother.</font>

610
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:16,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, when's the last time
you talked to him?</font>

611
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:26,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't need this. Hey, listen. Hey!
I don't have to explain myself to you.</font>

612
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is your son a terrorist?
- Yeah, my son's a terrorist.</font>

613
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:30,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well, he's just as likely
to be a terrorist as my brother.</font>

614
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:33,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">And let's not forget you in all this. Why
are you here? What's your day job?</font>

615
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I know it isn't manual shift driver.
- I'm a paralegal.</font>

- Paralegal?</font>

618
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do I know you're not lying to me?
What does a paralegal do?</font>

619
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">The same thing as the guys
with their names on the door,</font>

620
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:45,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">except I do it for $11 an hour,
so they can bill 200.</font>

621
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:46,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">That nail it for you, Sherlock?</font>

622
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">That still doesn't explain why
we're walking out here...</font>

623
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I don't know why the hell I'm out here!

- What is that?</font>

628
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:07,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Now she wants me to drive you?
- Who, "she"?</font>

629
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:09,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I won't. I'm done!
- You know "she"?</font>

630
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:10,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Wait.
- Stay right there.</font>

631

I am American. I'm finished! I'm done!</font>

636
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What? What are you talking about?
- You take it!</font>

637
