<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, come on, come on.</font>

146
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:48,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jerry?</font>

147
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mrs. Wierzbowski! I was just... I
thought you might have been sleeping.</font>

148
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:53,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- So... But I have...</font>

149
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have some rent here.</font>

150
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:57,598
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Here you go.
- Yeah, some is good. All is better.</font>

151
00:09:57,681 --> 00:09:59,558
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's most of it. Here.</font>

152
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:00,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">$1, $1, $1...</font>

153
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:02,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no. Look.
Here's a five there.</font>

154
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:04,897
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Five.
- Yeah.</font>

155
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is girl? I
don't see her no more.</font>

156
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:09,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know you're the
only woman for me.</font>

157
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:11,236
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, that's done. She got smart.</font>

158
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Like the others.
- Yeah. Yeah.</font>

159
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:18,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is woman friend? Answer. Then see
if she give you money for rent.</font>

160
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:20,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">One second.</font>

161
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:24,374
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Mom.</font>

162
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:28,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

163
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:58,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Looks just like him.
- I'm not him.</font>

164
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:40,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">Six months without
a boo or a bah, huh?</font>

165
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:42,471
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, sir.</font>

166
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:44,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">So where were you this time?</font>

167
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:50,562
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alaska. Singapore.
I got a job there.</font>

168
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:57,736
<font color="#FFFFFF">I... I spoke to Stanford.</font>

169
00:12:57,819 --> 00:12:58,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">I pulled some strings.</font>

170
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:00,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">They said they'd take you back.
Even though you took off...</font>

171
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:01,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two years ago, Dad.</font>

172
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:05,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jerry, you know, it wouldn't kill
you to ask for help once in a while.</font>

173
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:07,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to have
this conversation now?</font>

174
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:08,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's Stanford!
- You want to do this today.</font>

175
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:09,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know how many
people would kill...</font>

176
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Today? You want to have this now?
- Fine.</font>

177
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:15,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">You do whatever you
want. You always have.</font>

178
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:25,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I keep thinking, I'm
going to walk in here one day</font>

179
00:13:26,682 --> 00:13:30,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'm not going to feel like
a stranger in my own house.</font>

180
00:13:41,864 --> 00:13:43,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want your money.</font>

181
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:13,896
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I have your attention, please?</font>

182
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:18,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Smoking is not permitted on
the train. Chicago is next.</font>

183
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:40,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't find the keys
and he's late as usual.</font>

184
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:44,051
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm going to have to take you.
- He'll be here.</font>

185
00:14:44,927 --> 00:14:46,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, wait five more minutes.</font>

186
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:49,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">Help me out here. We
came home last night.</font>

187
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:52,017
<font color="#FFFFFF">I put the leftovers down. You
turned on the TV. I went over,</font>

188
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">said, "No TV, no TV,
no TV." Turned it off.</font>

189
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:56,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">Came over here.</font>

190
00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:59,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Checked the messages.
- Knocked over the phone.</font>

191
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:01,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right, knocked over
the phone. Put it back.</font>

192
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put the leftovers in the fridge.</font>

193
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:08,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go!</font>

194
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:11,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">I put vitamins in your toiletry
bag. Don't forget to take...</font>

195
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:12,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Two in the morning and two at night.
- That's right.</font>

196
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">And your inhaler's in
the back of your bag.</font>

197
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:15,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sammy!
- Daddy!</font>

198
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:17,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come here. You didn't think I'd
miss the big send-off, do you, huh?</font>

199
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:19,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's get you on this train.</font>

200
00:15:19,378 --> 00:15:21,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This must be your...
- Trumpet.</font>

201
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:23,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">My God, this weighs, like, 200
pounds. You carry this yourself?</font>

202
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:24,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mr. And Mrs. Holloman!
- Miss.</font>

203
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:26,593
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You just made it.
- Right.</font>

204
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:28,178
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Here, Sam.
- Thanks.</font>

205
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:29,263
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Listen to me.
- I have one more here.</font>

206
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:32,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">All these other kids, right? They're
going to call their moms, too, all right?</font>

207
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:33,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're just going to lie about it.</font>

208
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:36,937
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, and eat junk food 'cause this
is your one chance, but brush your teeth.</font>

209
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:40,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mom, you got to stop. I'm
going to miss you, too.</font>

210
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:41,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">Capitol Limited to
D.C. is departing now.</font>

211
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:43,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me a hug.</font>

212
00:15:43,235 --> 00:15:44,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">All aboard.</font>

213
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:46,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I love you so much.
- I love you, too.</font>

214
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:49,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Shine bright, okay?
- Okay.</font>

215
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:53,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rock the house, buddy. You're
going to be great. Okay?</font>

216
00:15:53,162 --> 00:15:54,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay.
- I'll see you later.</font>

217
00:15:54,538 --> 00:15:57,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Bye!
- Have fun in D.C.!</font>

218
00:15:57,249 --> 00:15:59,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Bye, Mom!
- Your mom going to be okay?</font>

219
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:01,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's unclear.</font>

220
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:03,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm so sorry. I got
stuck in traffic,</font>

221
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:05,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">- and I didn't even...
- Don't even say it.</font>

222
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:09,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">All aboard!</font>

223
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:12,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.
Five-nine-one-three.</font>

224
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's here. It's here.</font>

225
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, okay.</font>

226
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:42,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Come on!
- Two seconds. Sorry.</font>

227
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:51,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, wait.</font>

228
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey, hang on a second.
- Sorry.</font>

229
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:03,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're dropping money.
- Sir, sir!</font>

230
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:05,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">Big date, you know?
Fingers crossed, huh?</font>

231
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:11,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Here you go. Have a good day!
- Thank you.</font>

232
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Jerry!
- What?</font>

233
00:17:15,786 --> 00:17:17,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So many boxes.
- Boxes?</font>

234
00:17:17,788 --> 00:17:20,249
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had to open your
room. All day they come.</font>

235
00:17:20,332 --> 00:17:21,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Big boxes, small boxes.
- My boxes?</font>

236
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:23,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know. Whose
boxes would they be?</font>

237
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:25,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">- All right, okay.
- Look at them there. See in there?</font>

238
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:27,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">- See, I put them all...
- Yeah. Yeah.</font>

239
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:29,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Listen, I have something for you here.
- Yeah.</font>

240
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:31,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is rent for this month
and next month, too, okay?</font>

241
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, my.
- Thank you.</font>

242
00:18:46,585 --> 00:18:47,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello?</font>

243
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:50,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">The FBI will arrive at your
apartment in 30 seconds.</font>

244
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must flee the premises.</font>

245
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:53,258
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who... Who is this?</font>

246
00:18:53,342 --> 00:18:54,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've been activated, Jerry.</font>

247
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:56,803
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who the hell is this?
- Your compliance is vital.</font>

248
00:18:56,887 --> 00:18:57,888
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did you get this number?</font>

249
00:18:57,971 --> 00:19:00,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">You now have 24 seconds.
Leave your residence.</font>

250
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:04,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your destination, the Mathis train
station. We will guide you from there.</font>

251
00:19:04,645 --> 00:19:05,687
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is this?</font>

252
00:19:05,771 --> 00:19:07,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">The evidence in your
apartment is irrefutable.</font>

253
00:19:08,065 --> 00:19:09,066
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Listen.
- 17 seconds.</font>

254
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:10,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to hang this phone up now.</font>

255
00:19:10,234 --> 00:19:11,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">They'll seek your arrest
for conspiracy, treason...</font>

256
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:13,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm hanging this phone up now!
- ... violating state and local law.</font>

257
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:15,531
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You tell me how you got this number!
- Maximum penalty, death.</font>

258
00:19:15,614 --> 00:19:17,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, none of this is mine!</font>

259
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:23,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">FBI, FBI, FBI! Get
down on the floor!</font>

260
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:24,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get on the ground!</font>

261
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:27,709
<font color="#FFFFFF">Down now! Get down!</font>

262
00:19:27,793 --> 00:19:30,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I didn't do anything!
- Get down!</font>

263
00:19:30,212 --> 00:19:31,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Listen!
- Don't move.</font>

264
00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:33,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not mine! It's not mine!</font>

265
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is obviously some
sort of mistake, right?</font>

266
00:19:47,396 --> 00:19:50,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, I don't know what
I'm doing in this room, sir.</font>

267
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's cold as hell outside.</font>

268
00:19:54,069 --> 00:19:56,864
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You draw?
- I what?</font>

269
00:19:56,947 --> 00:20:00,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you draw? Do you sketch? You
have ink all over your fingers.</font>

270
00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:04,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, you know you got
the wrong guy, right?</font>

271
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:05,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, this is all
some kind of sick joke.</font>

272
00:20:05,831 --> 00:20:08,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I don't know what I'm doing here.
- Obviously.</font>

273
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:11,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">Obviously you have nothing
to do with it, yeah.</font>

274
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:13,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you love your brother?</font>

275
00:20:15,174 --> 00:20:17,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or did you hate him?
Did you admire him?</font>

276
00:20:19,803 --> 00:20:22,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was your brother
patriotic, would you say?</font>

277
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:28,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">When's the last time you saw him?</font>

278
00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:32,191
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Christmas.
- This past Christmas?</font>

279
00:20:33,609 --> 00:20:36,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Three Christmases ago.
- Three years, huh?</font>

280
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:40,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, the phone records show that you
haven't even called him in over a year.</font>

281
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:43,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">So no text messages?
No smoke signals?</font>

282
00:20:43,327 --> 00:20:44,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">No MySpace or Facebook messages?</font>

283
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:46,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, so what are you
trying to say? We're not...</font>

284
00:20:46,538 --> 00:20:47,706
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you asking if
we're the type of twins</font>

285
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:52,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">that wear the same shirt to the mall,
hold hands, and things like that? No.</font>

286
00:20:52,711 --> 00:20:55,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sir, I don't even know your name.
- I'm sorry, that was rude of me.</font>

287
00:20:55,506 --> 00:20:56,715

going to be arrested.</font>

intel to the Copy Cabana?</font>

573
00:41:20,105 --> 00:41:23,775

down in size for stealth operations.</font>

574
00:41:23,859 --> 00:41:25,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">This valve is a sonic trigger.</font>

575
00:41:25,861 --> 00:41:28,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">The sound frequency
triggers the explosion.</font>

576

programed to have a unique</font>

586
00:42:25,045 --> 00:42:26,630

<font color="#FFFFFF">- What kind of stone is this?
- No questions.</font>

590
00:42:43,272 --> 00:42:44,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cut the stone and place the setting</font>

591
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:47,151
<font color="#FFFFFF">according to the
specifications we sent you.</font>

592
00:43:30,903 --> 00:43:33,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd just dropped my
son off at the train.</font>

593
00:43:33,197 --> 00:43:36,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was out having drinks with my
girlfriends when the call came.</font>

594
00:43:36,158 --> 00:43:38,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What about you?
- The first call came to my apartment.</font>

595
00:43:39,203 --> 00:43:41,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">- After the boxes?
- Yeah.</font>

596
00:43:42,539 --> 00:43:45,667
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, then this whole thing's
obviously gotta be about your brother.</font>

597
00:43:45,751 --> 00:43:47,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Really, it's that obvious, huh?
- I mean, you got all this stuff.</font>

598
00:43:47,961 --> 00:43:49,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">The weapons, the cash,
the airplane manuals.</font>

599
00:43:49,546 --> 00:43:50,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay.
- He was your twin.</font>

600
00:43:50,714 --> 00:43:51,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">- They sent it to the wrong brother.
- Right.</font>

601
00:43:51,882 --> 00:43:53,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you're implying my
brother's a terrorist.</font>

602
00:43:53,133 --> 00:43:55,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm implying, if not
him, then why you?</font>

603
00:44:00,807 --> 00:44:04,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry. I know he just died. I'm not
trying to insult his memory or anything.</font>

604
00:44:04,478 --> 00:44:07,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, he hasn't been dead long
enough to be a memory, Rachel.</font>

605
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:09,566
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you knew my brother, you'd
laugh all day at the idea</font>

606
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:11,693
<font color="#FFFFFF">that he was a terrorist or a spy
or whatever else you're saying...</font>

607
00:44:11,777 --> 00:44:12,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How do you know?
- Because he's my brother.</font>

608
00:44:12,986 --> 00:44:14,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's something you would
know about your brother.</font>

609
00:44:14,321 --> 00:44:16,657
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, when's the last
time you talked to him?</font>

610
00:44:22,037 --> 00:44:26,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't need this. Hey, listen. Hey!
I don't have to explain myself to you.</font>

611
00:44:26,834 --> 00:44:28,669
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is your son a terrorist?
- Yeah, my son's a terrorist.</font>

612
00:44:28,752 --> 00:44:30,879
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well, he's just as likely
to be a terrorist as my brother.</font>

613
00:44:30,963 --> 00:44:33,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">And let's not forget you in all this.
Why are you here? What's your day job?</font>

614
00:44:33,715 --> 00:44:36,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I know it isn't manual shift driver.
- I'm a paralegal.</font>

615
00:44:36,385 --> 00:44:37,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I don't have a connection to anything.
- Paralegal?</font>

616
00:44:37,719 --> 00:44:39,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do I know you're not lying
to me? What does a paralegal do?</font>

617
00:44:40,055 --> 00:44:41,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">The same thing as the guys
with their names on the door,</font>

618
00:44:41,932 --> 00:44:45,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">except I do it for $11 an
hour, so they can bill 200.</font>

619
00:44:45,477 --> 00:44:46,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">That nail it for you, Sherlock?</font>

620
00:44:46,937 --> 00:44:48,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">That still doesn't explain
why we're walking out here...</font>

621
00:44:48,605 --> 00:44:50,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I don't know why the hell I'm out here!
- Yeah, I know...</font>

622
00:44:58,198 --> 00:44:59,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey!</font>

623
00:45:00,742 --> 00:45:02,995

- Who are you?</font>

624
00:45:03,078 --> 00:45:05,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- I sent the package like she asked.</font>

625
00:45:05,581 --> 00:45:06,874
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Wait, what package?
- What is that?</font>

626
00:45:06,957 --> 00:45:08,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Now she wants me to drive you?
- Who, "she"?</font>

627
00:45:08,333 --> 00:45:09,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I won't. I'm done!
- You know "she"?</font>

628
00:45:09,793 --> 00:45:10,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Wait.
- Stay right there.</font>

629
00:45:10,961 --> 00:45:12,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Get back.
- Here. Here's the address.</font>

630
00:45:12,546 --> 00:45:15,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why are you attack...
- Here. Here are the keys.</font>

631
00:45:15,549 --> 00:45:16,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take the goddamn van!</font>

632
00:45:16,633 --> 00:45:17,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You think I'm going to...
- Who's doing this?</font>

633
00:45:17,718 --> 00:45:21,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">do this because I'm Iranian? I
am American. I'm finished! I'm done!</font>

634
00:45:21,430 --> 00:45:23,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What? What are you talking about?
- You take it!</font>

635
00:45:24,016 --> 00:45:25,851
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What are you talking about?
- I won't do this because I can't.</font>

636
00:45:25,934 --> 00:45:27,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hello?
- Stop him now, or he will die.</font>

637
00:45:28,061 --> 00:45:29,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen to me, what
are you talking about?</font>

638
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:31,732
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You try to do this without me!
- How are you seeing us right now?</font>

639
00:45:31,815 --> 00:45:33,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Stop him now.
- What is she saying?</font>

640
00:45:34,067 --> 00:45:36,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop. Hey! You gotta stop!</font>

641
00:45:36,528 --> 00:45:39,406
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Wait!
- You gotta stop!</font>

642
00:46:12,731 --> 00:46:15,776
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You killed that man.
- Desertion is not an option.</font>

01:02:15,444 --> 01:02:17,738
<font color="#FFFFFF">And find out about Shaw.</font>

858
01:02:17,821 --> 01:02:19,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Major.
- Sir?</font>

859
01:02:25,621 --> 01:02:28,790
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your profile reveals a
pathological aversion to conformity,</font>

860
01:02:28,874 --> 01:02:32,002
<font color="#FFFFFF">education, career, even voting.</font>

861
01:02:32,169 --> 01:02:34,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">Therefore, we conclude
that extreme coercion</font>

862
01:02:34,505 --> 01:02:36,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">is necessary to motivate you.</font>

863
01:02:36,173 --> 01:02:39,092
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unlike your brother Ethan,
who was self-motivated.</font>

864
01:02:39,176 --> 01:02:41,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you know my brother?
He worked in a press office.</font>

865
01:02:41,303 --> 01:02:43,931
<font color="#FFFFFF">His employment there was a cover.</font>

866
01:02:44,014 --> 01:02:46,892
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everyone in counterintelligence
operations has one.</font>

867
01:02:48,352 --> 01:02:52,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ethan was a Minuteman, just
like me. Army, Navy, Air Force.</font>

868
01:02:52,689 --> 01:02:55,108
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every branch of the military
had a Minuteman posted here</font>

869
01:02:55,192 --> 01:03:00,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">for a 12-hour shift, just in case she
flags a threat, and monitor hardware.</font>

870
01:03:00,322 --> 01:03:05,619
<font color="#FFFFFF">The night Ethan died, he left
this post three minutes early.</font>

871
01:03:05,702 --> 01:03:08,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, you don't do that. Ever.</font>

872
01:03:09,206 --> 01:03:12,334
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are both required
to complete a task.</font>

873
01:03:12,417 --> 01:03:15,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- The protection of our national security.</font>

874
01:03:15,170 --> 01:03:17,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Constitution allows for
civilians to be recruited</font>

875
01:03:17,714 --> 01:03:19,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">- for the national defense.
- I'm done.</font>

876
01:03:19,132 --> 01:03:21,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm done. You don't know me!
You don't know my brother!</font>

877
01:03:21,301 --> 01:03:24,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is bullshit! I'm not serving
in the goddamn national defense!</font>

878
01:03:24,388 --> 01:03:27,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">We know all about
him, Jerry. And you.</font>

879
01:03:28,725 --> 01:03:31,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Before he was a year
old, Ethan walked.</font>

880
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:35,107
<font color="#FFFFFF">The same task took you
18 months to accomplish.</font>

881
01:03:37,317 --> 01:03:38,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How did you get this?
- Look at Ethan.</font>

882
01:03:38,735 --> 01:03:41,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">They were uploaded
from his home computer.</font>

883
01:03:41,196 --> 01:03:43,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to come over here, sweetie?
Come on over here with Ethan.</font>

884
01:03:43,907 --> 01:03:46,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Jerry! Birthday cake. Let's go.
- Ethan had these?</font>

885
01:03:46,618 --> 01:03:47,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, let's blow out the candles.</font>

886
01:03:48,036 --> 01:03:49,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just for a little bit.</font>

887
01:03:49,913 --> 01:03:54,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">Although you're identical in appearance,
you lack the motivation and talent</font>

888
01:03:54,168 --> 01:03:56,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">- that enabled Ethan to excel.
- ... Jerry, come on.</font>

889
01:03:56,461 --> 01:03:58,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Stop it.
- Do it like Ethan did.</font>

890
01:03:58,297 --> 01:04:02,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're different from Ethan
in every way, except one.</font>

891
01:04:02,259 --> 01:04:04,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jerry, let your
brother help you. Jerry!</font>

892
01:04:04,428 --> 01:04:08,599
<font color="#FFFFFF">You now have 14 minutes to change
your appearance and return to the bus.</font>

893
01:04:18,025 --> 01:04:20,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have 14 minutes.</font>

894
01:04:26,950 --> 01:04:29,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">These couriers were
hired by Halloway-Smith</font>

895
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:31,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">- to transport some sort of case.
- The chemical company?</font>

896
01:04:31,914 --> 01:04:35,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, exactly. Now, whatever
was in that case, Shaw now has.</font>

897
01:04:35,125 --> 01:04:36,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">They went right for the case.</font>

898
01:04:36,710 --> 01:04:41,381
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give us a minute, will you? We need
to know exactly what was in that case.</font>

899
01:04:41,465 --> 01:04:44,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">They never tell you what's in the
case. I mean, it could Bubonic Plague.</font>

900
01:04:44,635 --> 01:04:46,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Could be Grandpa's Viagra.
- You know anything?</font>

901
01:04:47,054 --> 01:04:48,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What?
- Anything at all?</font>

902
01:04:49,139 --> 01:04:51,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What about these guns?
- What about them?</font>

903
01:04:51,350 --> 01:04:52,726
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was a pump-action Remington 870.</font>

904
01:04:52,810 --> 01:04:55,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I know what kind of
guns they are. Get me a gun.</font>

905
01:04:55,854 --> 01:04:57,397
<font color="#FFFFFF">How were they holding
them? Get me a gun!</font>

906
01:04:57,481 --> 01:04:58,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell do you mean,
how were they holding them?</font>

907
01:04:58,982 --> 01:05:01,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, in what position
were they holding the gun?</font>

908
01:05:01,693 --> 01:05:04,071
<font color="#FFFFFF">- For instance, like this?
- Hey, hey, hey.</font>

909
01:05:04,154 --> 01:05:05,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Put that damned thing down!
- Or like in a music video,</font>

910
01:05:05,656 --> 01:05:06,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">- or something like that?
- Hey, hey, hey!</font>

911
01:05:06,990 --> 01:05:08,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Put it down!
- They weren't pros!</font>

912
01:05:08,116 --> 01:05:09,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, that's what I was asking you.</font>

913
01:05:09,326 --> 01:05:10,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">So they didn't know
how to handle a weapon.</font>

914
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:12,079
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- All right.</font>

915
01:05:12,162 --> 01:05:14,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get what you can out of
Batman and Robin here.</font>

916
01:05:14,122 --> 01:05:15,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah.
- Thank you.</font>

917
01:05:15,999 --> 01:05:18,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">We just checked cameras.
They said Shaw fired at one...</font>

918
01:05:18,836 --> 01:05:21,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't tell me. Everything
magically went black.</font>

919
01:05:45,863 --> 01:05:48,282
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, my name's Thomas
Morgan. I'm with the FBI.</font>

920
01:05:48,365 --> 01:05:51,368
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are your cameras on a network?
- No, man.</font>

921
01:05:51,451 --> 01:05:54,246
<font color="#FFFFFF">- VCR's in the back.
- Well, I'm gonna need your tapes.</font>

922
01:05:57,124 --> 01:05:58,208
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shit.</font>

923
01:06:01,128 --> 01:06:02,129
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sam!</font>

924
01:06:02,546 --> 01:06:04,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sam? Sam, where are you?
- Hey, Mom, I got your message.</font>

925
01:06:04,715 --> 01:06:06,133
<font color="#FFFFFF">The train's awesome!</font>

926
01:06:06,216 --> 01:06:07,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sam, listen to me.
- Brian tried to burp the alphabet,</font>

927
01:06:08,010 --> 01:06:09,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">- but he gagged when he got to "M."
- Listen to me.</font>

928
01:06:09,928 --> 01:06:11,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Call you when I hit D.C. Bye, Mom.</font>

929
01:06:11,763 --> 01:06:14,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your son left that
message 60 seconds ago.</font>

930
01:06:14,475 --> 01:06:18,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">You will see him again. But
there's something we require first.</font>

931
01:06:19,563 --> 01:06:22,149
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thank you.
- Here you go.</font>

932
01:06:27,196 --> 01:06:30,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- You will do it, or Sam will die.</font>

933
01:06:30,657 --> 01:06:32,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have six minutes
to return to the bus.</font>

934
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:44,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Ready?
- Here, you okay?</font>

935
01:06:44,796 --> 01:06:45,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should go.</font>

936
01:06:49,843 --> 01:06:53,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sir, we got something.
Play this screen right here.</font>

937
01:06:54,807 --> 01:06:57,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, freeze that. Now zoom in on
the front of the bus right there.</font>

938
01:06:58,060 --> 01:06:59,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Put it up on the other monitor.
- Yes, sir.</font>

939
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:02,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now zoom in. Zoom in on
this point right here.</font>

940
01:07:02,606 --> 01:07:04,441
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can we zoom in tighter than that?</font>

941
01:07:06,819 --> 01:07:08,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, enhance that shot.</font>

942
01:07:10,531 --> 01:07:12,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's our guy, that's Jerry Shaw.</font>

943
01:07:13,867 --> 01:07:17,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Zoom in right here on this spot.
Right there. The reflection.</font>

944
01:07:17,204 --> 01:07:18,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. All right.</font>

945
01:07:18,872 --> 01:07:20,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right there. Hello, sweetheart.</font>

946
01:07:20,874 --> 01:07:24,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, so we got a
white brunette female,</font>

947
01:07:24,127 --> 01:07:26,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">mid to late 20s, approximately 5'9".</font>

948
01:07:26,463 --> 01:07:28,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">Find me that chartered bus!</font>

949
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:32,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">Masako. M-A-S-A-K-O.
Sightseeing Tours.</font>

950
01:07:32,135 --> 01:07:33,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">What time did they get on?</font>

951
01:07:39,351 --> 01:07:42,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry for what
I said about Ethan.</font>

952
01:07:50,863 --> 01:07:53,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like he had a rocket
strapped to his back.</font>

953
01:07:53,490 --> 01:07:55,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it wasn't his fault.
He was just that way.</font>

954
01:07:56,577 --> 01:07:58,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I was not that way.</font>

955
01:08:00,581 --> 01:08:04,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was the complete opposite. I
was the brother with lead shoes.</font>

956
01:08:06,837 --> 01:08:08,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was my role, I was good at it.</font>

957
01:08:10,841 --> 01:08:13,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">And he'd always try to help me. You
know, "This is how you throw it. "</font>

958
01:08:13,844 --> 01:08:17,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Do it like this."Write it
like that."Put your foot here. "</font>

959
01:08:17,598 --> 01:08:21,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even with the small things.
Homework, chores, anything like that,</font>

960
01:08:21,310 --> 01:08:23,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">he would handle it and
then say that I did it,</font>

961
01:08:23,103 --> 01:08:27,608
<font color="#FFFFFF">just so my father would
notice me. That was Ethan.</font>

962
01:08:35,073 --> 01:08:38,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">He never asked me
for anything. Ever.</font>

963
01:08:40,204 --> 01:08:45,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">And whatever this is, he was part of it.
I feel like he needs my help to finish it.</font>

964
01:08:47,753 --> 01:08:49,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">I owe him that.</font>

965
01:08:56,762 --> 01:09:00,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">We are now approaching
Dayton International Airport.</font>

966
01:09:00,098 --> 01:09:05,312
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please use caution as you exit the bus.
And don't forget any of your belongings.</font>

967
01:09:05,395 --> 01:09:06,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

968
01:09:08,023 --> 01:09:11,568

you for your cooperation.</font>

971

toward them now. Yes.</font>

972
01:09:22,913 --> 01:09:26,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey. These are from her.
Go to the ticketing machine.</font>

973
01:09:26,708 --> 01:09:30,295

tickets. Then walk to Gate 1-C.</font>

974
01:09:31,755 --> 01:09:33,090

975
01:09:38,887 --> 01:09:40,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a nice picture.</font>

976
01:09:46,770 --> 01:09:49,857
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. I need you guys at
every exit, watching faces.</font>

977
01:09:49,940 --> 01:09:51,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">Work the secure area first.</font>

978
01:09:51,775 --> 01:09:53,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go to the tower, have them order</font>

979
01:09:53,277 --> 01:09:55,779

change the departure boards.</font>

phone off? You cannot take it through.</font>

982

- FBI. Please step back.</font>

983
01:10:17,301 --> 01:10:19,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, there are others behind you.</font>

984
01:10:19,136 --> 01:10:21,054

- Shoes and hats off, please!</font>

985
01:10:21,138 --> 01:10:24,224

- Laptops should be out of their cases!</font>

986
01:10:24,308 --> 01:10:26,685

are off and screened separately.</font>

- Have boarding passes in hand, please!</font>

988
01:10:30,147 --> 01:10:31,523

989
01:10:31,607 --> 01:10:33,984

990

mistake of my life?</font>

1047

You got your child out of it.</font>

1048

- Yeah, yeah,</font>

1049

- The tooth grew in.</font>

1056
01:17:42,246 --> 01:17:44,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I hope so.
- It's an old picture.</font>

1057

<font color="#FFFFFF">See? You're a good influence.</font>

1058
01:17:46,416 --> 01:17:49,711

<font color="#FFFFFF">He is a shithead.</font>

1064
01:18:04,601 --> 01:18:08,063

his own son's birthday.</font>

1065

1067
01:18:18,699 --> 01:18:21,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was so scared I didn't
know what I was gonna do.</font>

just smiling at me.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">And that little face...</font>

1072

1082
01:19:33,065 --> 01:19:34,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">With his cell phone.</font>

1083
01:19:39,905 --> 01:19:42,115

purpose. Is that Morse code?</font>

1084
01:19:42,199 --> 01:19:44,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah.
- Here.</font>

1085
