1
00:02:09,795 --> 00:02:12,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you here to kill me?</font>

2
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:22,723
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know what this is.</font>

3
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:28,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've seen one before.
Many, many years ago.</font>

4
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:34,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">It belonged to a man I met
in a half-remembered dream.</font>

5
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:42,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">A man possessed
of some radical notions.</font>

6
00:02:46,415 --> 00:02:49,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is the most resilient parasite?</font>

7
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:52,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">A bacteria? A virus?</font>

8
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:54,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">An intestinal worm?</font>

9
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:56,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh...</font>

10
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">What Mr. Cobb is trying to say...</font>

11
00:02:58,302 --> 00:02:59,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">An idea.</font>

12
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:03,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">Resilient. Highly contagious.</font>

13
00:03:03,473 --> 00:03:06,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once an idea has taken hold of the brain,
it's almost impossible to eradicate.</font>

14
00:03:08,562 --> 00:03:12,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">An idea that is fully formed,
fully understood, that sticks.</font>

15
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:13,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right in there somewhere.</font>

16
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:15,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">For someone like you to steal?</font>

17
00:03:15,485 --> 00:03:18,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes. In the dream state,
your conscious defenses are lowered...</font>

18
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:21,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">and that makes your thoughts
vulnerable to theft.</font>

19
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:22,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's called extraction.</font>

20
00:03:22,618 --> 00:03:26,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Saito, we can train
your subconscious to defend itself...</font>

21
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:28,831
<font color="#FFFFFF">from even the most skilled extractor.</font>

22
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">How can you do that?</font>

23
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:33,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I am the most skilled extractor.</font>

24
00:03:33,629 --> 00:03:37,049
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know how to search your mind
and find your secrets. I know the tricks.</font>

25
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:40,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I can teach them to you,
so that even when you're asleep...</font>

26
00:03:40,302 --> 00:03:42,638
<font color="#FFFFFF">your defense is never down.</font>

27
00:03:43,555 --> 00:03:47,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, if you want my help, you're gonna
have to be completely open with me.</font>

28
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:50,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to know my way around
your thoughts better than your wife...</font>

29
00:03:51,146 --> 00:03:53,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">better than your therapist,
better than anyone.</font>

30
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">If this is a dream,
and you have a safe full of secrets...</font>

31
00:03:56,735 --> 00:03:59,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to know what's in that safe.</font>

32
00:03:59,237 --> 00:04:02,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">In order for this all to work,
you need to completely let me in.</font>

33
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:10,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enjoy your evening, gentlemen,
as I consider your proposal.</font>

34
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:13,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">He knows.</font>

35
00:04:16,755 --> 00:04:18,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's going on up there?</font>

36
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,062
<font color="#FFFFFF">Saito knows. He's playing with us.</font>

37
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">Doesn't matter. I can get it here.
Trust me.</font>

38
00:05:17,983 --> 00:05:19,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">The information is in the safe.</font>

39
00:05:19,651 --> 00:05:21,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">He looked right at it
when I mentioned secrets.</font>

40
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:24,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's she doing here?</font>

41
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just head back to the room.
All right? I'll take care of this.</font>

42
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:32,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, make sure you do.
We're here to work.</font>

43
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:45,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I jumped, would I survive?</font>

44
00:05:47,721 --> 00:05:50,098
<font color="#FFFFFF">With a clean dive, perhaps.</font>

45
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:51,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mal, what are you doing here?</font>

46
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you might be missing me.</font>

47
00:05:54,603 --> 00:05:55,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know that I am.</font>

48
00:05:57,314 --> 00:05:59,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I can't trust you anymore.</font>

49
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:01,901
<font color="#FFFFFF">So what?</font>

50
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,654
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like Arthur's taste.</font>

51
00:06:05,822 --> 00:06:09,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">Actually, the subject is partial
to postwar British painters.</font>

52
00:06:11,161 --> 00:06:12,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, have a seat.</font>

53
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:22,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell me...</font>

54
00:06:22,464 --> 00:06:24,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">do the children miss me?</font>

55
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't imagine.</font>

56
00:06:34,226 --> 00:06:35,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

57
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just getting some fresh air.</font>

58
00:06:37,437 --> 00:06:39,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stay where you are, Mal.</font>

59
00:06:52,911 --> 00:06:54,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goddamn it.</font>

60
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">Turn around.</font>

61
00:07:58,351 --> 00:07:59,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">The gun, Dom.</font>

62
00:08:08,653 --> 00:08:09,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please.</font>

63
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now the envelope, Mr. Cobb.</font>

64
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:28,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did she tell you?
Or have you known all along?</font>

65
00:08:28,507 --> 00:08:33,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">That you're here to steal from me,
or that we are actually asleep?</font>

66
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to know the name
of your employer.</font>

67
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:45,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, there's no use threatening him
in a dream, right, Mal?</font>

68
00:08:46,024 --> 00:08:48,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">That depends
on what you're threatening.</font>

69
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:51,571
<font color="#FFFFFF">Killing him would just wake him up.</font>

70
00:08:52,322 --> 00:08:53,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">But pain...</font>

71
00:08:57,452 --> 00:08:59,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pain is in the mind.</font>

72
00:09:00,038 --> 00:09:04,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">And judging by the decor,
we're in your mind, aren't we, Arthur?</font>

73
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:18,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What are you doing? It's too soon.
- But the dream's collapsing.</font>

74
00:09:18,932 --> 00:09:22,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna try to keep Saito under
a little bit longer. We're almost there.</font>

75
00:09:36,575 --> 00:09:40,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was close. Very close.</font>

76
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop him!</font>

77
00:10:22,245 --> 00:10:24,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">This isn't gonna work. Wake him up.</font>

78
00:10:45,226 --> 00:10:47,187
<font color="#FFFFFF">He won't wake.</font>

79
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:52,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Give him the kick.
What?</font>

80
00:10:53,485 --> 00:10:54,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dunk him.</font>

81
00:11:39,072 --> 00:11:40,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's out.</font>

82
00:11:45,745 --> 00:11:47,788
<font color="#FFFFFF">You came prepared, hmm?</font>

83
00:11:47,956 --> 00:11:51,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not even my head of security knows
this apartment. How did you find it?</font>

84
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:56,172
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's difficult for a man of your position
to keep a love nest like this secret...</font>

85
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,883
<font color="#FFFFFF">particularly where there's
a married woman involved.</font>

86
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:01,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">- She would never...
- Yet here we are.</font>

87
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:04,179
<font color="#FFFFFF">- With a dilemma.
- They're getting closer.</font>

88
00:12:04,347 --> 00:12:07,142
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You got what you came for.
Well, that's not true.</font>

89
00:12:07,308 --> 00:12:09,977
<font color="#FFFFFF">You left out a key piece of information,
didn't you?</font>

90
00:12:10,145 --> 00:12:13,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">You held something back
because you knew what we were up to.</font>

91
00:12:13,481 --> 00:12:16,359
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Question is, why'd you let us in at all?
- An audition.</font>

92
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">- An audition for what?
- Doesn't matter. You failed.</font>

93
00:12:20,655 --> 00:12:23,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">We extracted every bit of information
you had in there.</font>

94
00:12:23,783 --> 00:12:26,076
<font color="#FFFFFF">But your deception was obvious.</font>

95
00:13:06,951 --> 00:13:11,371
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So leave me and go.
- You don't seem to understand, Mr. Saito.</font>

96
00:13:11,539 --> 00:13:15,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">That corporation that hired us,
they won't accept failure.</font>

97
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:18,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">We won't last two days.</font>

98
00:13:20,048 --> 00:13:21,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cobb?</font>

99
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:24,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looks like I'm gonna have to do this
a little more simply.</font>

100
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell us what you know!
Tell us what you know, now!</font>

101
00:13:31,851 --> 00:13:34,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've always hated this carpet.</font>

102
00:13:35,355 --> 00:13:39,234
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's stained and frayed
in such distinctive ways.</font>

103
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:44,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">But very definitely made of wool.</font>

104
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right now...</font>

105
00:13:47,659 --> 00:13:50,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm lying on polyester.</font>

106
00:13:53,957 --> 00:13:58,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which means I'm not lying
on my carpet, in my apartment.</font>

107
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,923
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have lived up to your reputation,
Mr. Cobb.</font>

108
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm still dreaming.</font>

109
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How'd it go?
- Not good.</font>

110
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:23,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dream within a dream, huh?
I'm impressed.</font>

111
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:28,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">But in my dream, you play by my rules.</font>

112
00:14:28,366 --> 00:14:30,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah, yes, but you see, Mr. Saito...</font>

113
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:32,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're not in your dream.</font>

114
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:33,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're in mine.</font>

115
00:14:43,881 --> 00:14:45,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">Asshole.
How do you mess up the carpet?</font>

116
00:14:46,134 --> 00:14:48,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It wasn't my fault.
- You're the architect.</font>

117
00:14:48,636 --> 00:14:50,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't know
he was gonna rub his cheek on it!</font>

118
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's enough.</font>

119
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,642
<font color="#FFFFFF">You. What the hell was all that?</font>

120
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:58,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I have it under control.
- I'd hate to see you out of control.</font>

121
00:14:58,187 --> 00:15:01,982
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't have time for this.
I'm getting off at Kyoto.</font>

122
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's not gonna check every compartment.</font>

123
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, well, I don't like trains.</font>

124
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:08,697
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen. Every man for himself.</font>

125
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, hello?</font>

126
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:26,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi, Daddy.
Hi, Dad.</font>

127
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:31,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, guys. Hey. How are you?
How you doing, huh?</font>

128
00:16:31,197 --> 00:16:33,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good.
Okay, I guess.</font>

129
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:37,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay? Who's just okay?
Is that you, James?</font>

130
00:16:37,495 --> 00:16:41,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. When are you coming home, Dad?</font>

131
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:47,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I can't, sweetheart. I can't.
Not for a while, remember?</font>

132
00:16:47,213 --> 00:16:48,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

133
00:16:48,881 --> 00:16:54,428
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I told you, I'm away
because I'm working, right?</font>

134
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:57,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">Grandma says you're never coming back.</font>

135
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">Phillipa, is that you?</font>

136
00:17:01,102 --> 00:17:03,437
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put Grandma on the phone for me,
will you?</font>

137
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's shaking her head.</font>

138
00:17:07,442 --> 00:17:09,943
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, just hope she's wrong about that.</font>

139
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">Daddy?</font>

140
00:17:12,739 --> 00:17:13,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, James?</font>

141
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is Mommy with you?</font>

142
00:17:18,244 --> 00:17:20,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">James, we talked about this.</font>

143
00:17:21,748 --> 00:17:24,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mommy's not here anymore.</font>

144
00:17:25,126 --> 00:17:26,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where?</font>

145
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's enough, kids. Say bye-bye.</font>

146
00:17:30,923 --> 00:17:33,968
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, I'm gonna send some presents
with Grandpa, all right?</font>

147
00:17:34,135 --> 00:17:35,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you be good, you be...</font>

148
00:17:45,646 --> 00:17:47,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Our ride's on the roof.
- Right.</font>

149
00:17:55,031 --> 00:17:56,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, are you okay?</font>

150
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,241
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Why?</font>

151
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, down in the dream,
Mal showing up.</font>

152
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:04,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I'm, uh, sorry about your leg.
Won't happen again.</font>

153
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:08,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's getting worse, isn't it?
- One apology's all you're getting, all right?</font>

154
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where's Nash?
- He hasn't shown. You wanna wait?</font>

155
00:18:10,838 --> 00:18:13,298
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were supposed to deliver
Saito's expansion plans...</font>

156
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,218
<font color="#FFFFFF">to Cobol Engineering two hours ago.</font>

157
00:18:15,384 --> 00:18:18,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">By now, they know we failed.
It's time we disappear.</font>

158
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where you gonna go?
- Buenos Aires.</font>

159
00:18:21,849 --> 00:18:26,103
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can lie low there, maybe sniff out
a job when things quiet down. You?</font>

160
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stateside.</font>

161
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:29,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">Send my regards.</font>

162
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:39,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">He sold you out. Thought to come
to me and bargain for his life.</font>

163
00:18:41,244 --> 00:18:43,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I offer you the satisfaction.</font>

164
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,544
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not the way I deal with things.</font>

165
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,683
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What will you do with him?
- Nothing.</font>

166
00:19:05,059 --> 00:19:07,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I can't speak for Cobol Engineering.</font>

167
00:19:22,076 --> 00:19:25,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What do you want from us?
- Inception.</font>

168
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:29,083
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is it possible?
- Of course not.</font>

169
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you can steal an idea
from someone's mind...</font>

170
00:19:31,627 --> 00:19:33,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">why can't you plant one there instead?</font>

171
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, here's me planting
an idea in your head.</font>

172
00:19:35,923 --> 00:19:39,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">I say, "Don't think about elephants."
What are you thinking about?</font>

173
00:19:39,427 --> 00:19:40,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">Elephants.</font>

174
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:43,763
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right. But it's not your idea,
because you know I gave it to you.</font>

175
00:19:43,973 --> 00:19:46,933
<font color="#FFFFFF">The subject's mind can always trace
the genesis of the idea.</font>

176
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:50,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">- True inspiration's impossible to fake.
- That's not true.</font>

177
00:19:52,857 --> 00:19:55,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Can you do it?
- Are you offering me a choice?</font>

178
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:58,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I can find my own way
to square things with Cobol.</font>

179
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then you do have a choice.</font>

180
00:20:01,157 --> 00:20:02,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I choose to leave, sir.</font>

181
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,539
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell the crew where you want to go.</font>

182
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:15,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, Mr. Cobb.</font>

183
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:21,134
<font color="#FFFFFF">How would you like to go home?</font>

184
00:20:21,928 --> 00:20:25,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">To America. To your children.</font>

185
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:28,976
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't fix that. No one can.</font>

186
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:32,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Just like inception.
- Cobb, come on.</font>

187
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:39,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How complex is the idea?
- Simple enough.</font>

188
00:20:39,195 --> 00:20:42,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">No idea is simple when you need
to plant it in somebody else's mind.</font>

189
00:20:43,157 --> 00:20:46,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">My main competitor is
an old man in poor health.</font>

190
00:20:46,827 --> 00:20:50,580
<font color="#FFFFFF">His son will soon inherit control
of the corporation.</font>

191
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,044
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need him to decide to break up
his father's empire.</font>

192
00:20:55,753 --> 00:20:58,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Cobb, we should walk away from this.
- Hold on.</font>

193
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:03,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I were to do this,
if I even could do it...</font>

194
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd need a guarantee.</font>

195
00:21:06,013 --> 00:21:09,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How do I know you can deliver?
- You don't.</font>

196
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:11,352
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I can.</font>

197
00:21:11,936 --> 00:21:16,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">So do you want to take a leap of faith...</font>

198
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:20,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">or become an old man,
filled with regret...</font>

199
00:21:20,945 --> 00:21:23,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">waiting to die alone?</font>

200
00:21:26,617 --> 00:21:30,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">Assemble your team, Mr. Cobb.
And choose your people more wisely.</font>

201
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:40,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I know how much
you wanna go home.</font>

202
00:21:43,676 --> 00:21:45,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">This can't be done.</font>

203
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:48,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, it can.
Just have to go deep enough.</font>

204
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:50,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't know that.</font>

205
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've done it before.</font>

206
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:56,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who'd you do it to?</font>

207
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:03,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are we going to Paris?</font>

208
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:06,656
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna need a new architect.</font>

209
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,634
<font color="#FFFFFF">You never did like your office, did you?</font>

210
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:30,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">No space to think
in that broom cupboard.</font>

211
00:22:32,349 --> 00:22:34,602
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is it safe for you to be here?</font>

212
00:22:35,811 --> 00:22:38,230
<font color="#FFFFFF">Extradition between France
and the United States...</font>

213
00:22:38,397 --> 00:22:40,607
<font color="#FFFFFF">is a bureaucratic nightmare,
you know that.</font>

214
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:43,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think they might find a way
to make it work in your case.</font>

215
00:22:43,694 --> 00:22:48,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I, uh, brought these for you to give
to the kids when you have a chance.</font>

216
00:22:48,365 --> 00:22:50,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">It'll take more than
the occasional stuffed animal...</font>

217
00:22:51,118 --> 00:22:54,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">to convince those children
they still have a father.</font>

218
00:22:54,288 --> 00:22:57,124
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just doing what I know.
I'm doing what you taught me.</font>

219
00:22:57,291 --> 00:22:58,792
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never taught you to be a thief.</font>

220
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, you taught me to navigate
people's minds.</font>

221
00:23:01,337 --> 00:23:02,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">But after what happened...</font>

222
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:06,383
<font color="#FFFFFF">there weren't a whole lot of legitimate
ways for me to use that skill.</font>

223
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:13,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing here, Dom?</font>

224
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:17,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I found a way home.</font>

225
00:23:17,686 --> 00:23:21,272
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a job
for some very, very powerful people.</font>

226
00:23:21,482 --> 00:23:25,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">People who I believe can fix
my charges permanently.</font>

227
00:23:26,695 --> 00:23:27,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I need your help.</font>

228
00:23:28,656 --> 00:23:31,991
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're here to corrupt
one of my brightest and best.</font>

229
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what I'm offering.
Let them decide for themselves.</font>

230
00:23:35,204 --> 00:23:36,663
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Money.
- Not just money.</font>

231
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">You remember.</font>

232
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:41,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the chance to build cathedrals,
entire cities...</font>

233
00:23:41,752 --> 00:23:43,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">things that never existed...</font>

234
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:46,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">things that couldn't exist
in the real world.</font>

235
00:23:47,049 --> 00:23:52,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you want me to let someone else
follow you into your fantasy?</font>

236
00:23:52,388 --> 00:23:54,347
<font color="#FFFFFF">They don't actually come into the dream.</font>

237
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:57,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">They just design the levels
and teach them to the dreamers. That's all.</font>

238
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:59,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">Design it yourself.</font>

239
00:24:01,856 --> 00:24:03,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mal won't let me.</font>

240
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:11,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come back to reality, Dom.</font>

241
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:15,618
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Please.
- Reality.</font>

242
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:18,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those kids, your grandchildren...</font>

243
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:22,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">they're waiting for their father to come
back home. That's their reality.</font>

244
00:24:22,877 --> 00:24:26,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">And this job, this last job,
that's how I get there.</font>

245
00:24:26,589 --> 00:24:30,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">I would not be standing here
if I knew any other way.</font>

246
00:24:33,387 --> 00:24:36,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need an architect
who's as good as I was.</font>

247
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:42,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've got somebody better.</font>

248
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:43,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ariadne?</font>

249
00:24:46,317 --> 00:24:48,861
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd like you to meet Mr. Cobb.</font>

250
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:50,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pleased to meet you.</font>

251
00:24:50,529 --> 00:24:55,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you have a few moments, Mr. Cobb has
a job offer he'd like to discuss with you.</font>

252
00:24:55,367 --> 00:24:56,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">A work placement?</font>

253
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:58,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not exactly.</font>

254
00:24:58,246 --> 00:24:59,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have a test for you.</font>

255
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not gonna tell me anything first?</font>

256
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:05,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Before I describe the job,
I have to know you can do it.</font>

257
00:25:05,377 --> 00:25:08,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why?
- It's not, strictly speaking, legal.</font>

258
00:25:11,675 --> 00:25:16,346
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have two minutes to design a maze
that it takes one minute to solve.</font>

259
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:19,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop.</font>

260
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">Again.</font>

261
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,522
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop.</font>

262
00:25:29,693 --> 00:25:31,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're gonna have to do better than that.</font>

263
00:25:44,792 --> 00:25:46,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's more like it.</font>

264
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:09,148
<font color="#FFFFFF">They say we only use a fraction
of our brain's true potential.</font>

265
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:10,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, that's when we're awake.</font>

266
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:14,153
<font color="#FFFFFF">When we're asleep,
our mind can do almost anything.</font>

267
00:26:14,321 --> 00:26:15,321
<font color="#FFFFFF">Such as?</font>

268
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:19,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">Imagine you're designing a building.
You consciously create each aspect.</font>

269
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:23,497
<font color="#FFFFFF">But sometimes, it feels like it's almost
creating itself, if you know what I mean.</font>

270
00:26:23,664 --> 00:26:25,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, like I'm discovering it.</font>

271
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:28,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">Genuine inspiration, right?</font>

272
00:26:28,252 --> 00:26:31,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, in a dream,
our mind continuously does this.</font>

273
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:36,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">We create and perceive
our world simultaneously.</font>

274
00:26:36,552 --> 00:26:39,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">And our mind does this so well
that we don't even know it's happening.</font>

275
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">That allows us to get right
in the middle of that process.</font>

276
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:45,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How?
- By taking over the creating part.</font>

277
00:26:45,561 --> 00:26:47,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, this is where I need you.</font>

278
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:49,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">You create the world of the dream.</font>

279
00:26:49,898 --> 00:26:55,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">We bring the subject into that dream,
and they fill it with their subconscious.</font>

280
00:26:55,447 --> 00:27:00,116
<font color="#FFFFFF">How could I ever acquire enough detail
to make them think that it's reality?</font>

281
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:03,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, dreams, they feel real
while we're in them, right?</font>

282
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:07,624
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's only when we wake up that we realize
something was actually strange.</font>

283
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:10,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me ask you a question.</font>

284
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:14,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">You never really remember
the beginning of a dream, do you?</font>

285
00:27:14,214 --> 00:27:17,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">You always wind up
right in the middle of what's going on.</font>

286
00:27:17,426 --> 00:27:18,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess, yeah.</font>

287
00:27:18,635 --> 00:27:20,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">So how did we end up here?</font>

288
00:27:20,596 --> 00:27:22,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we just came from the, uh...</font>

289
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:26,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">Think about it, Ariadne.
How did you get here?</font>

290
00:27:26,894 --> 00:27:28,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are you right now?</font>

291
00:27:32,107 --> 00:27:33,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're dreaming?</font>

292
00:27:33,442 --> 00:27:35,903
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're in the middle
of the workshop, sleeping.</font>

293
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:39,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is your first lesson
in shared dreaming. Stay calm.</font>

294
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">If it's just a dream,
then why are you...?</font>

295
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because it's never just a dream, is it?</font>

296
00:28:22,032 --> 00:28:25,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">And a face full of glass hurts like hell.
When you're in it, it feels real.</font>

297
00:28:25,494 --> 00:28:27,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why the military
developed dream sharing.</font>

298
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:31,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was a training program for soldiers
to shoot, stab and strangle each other...</font>

299
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:32,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then wake up.</font>

300
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:34,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did architects become involved?</font>

301
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, someone had to design
the dreams, right?</font>

302
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:40,299
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you give us
another five minutes?</font>

303
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:46,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">Five minutes? What...? We were talking
for, like, at least an hour.</font>

304
00:28:46,473 --> 00:28:48,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">In a dream, your mind
functions more quickly...</font>

305
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:51,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">therefore time seems
to feel more slow.</font>

306
00:28:51,895 --> 00:28:55,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">Five minutes in the real world
gives you an hour in the dream.</font>

307
00:28:55,983 --> 00:28:59,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you see what you
can get up to in five minutes?</font>

308
00:29:04,992 --> 00:29:07,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've got the basic layout.
Bookstore, café.</font>

309
00:29:08,078 --> 00:29:09,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">Almost everything else is here too.</font>

310
00:29:09,913 --> 00:29:12,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are the people?
- Projections of my subconscious.</font>

311
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,167
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yours?
- Yes.</font>

312
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:16,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember, you are the dreamer.
You build this world.</font>

313
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:19,714
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am the subject. My mind populates it.</font>

314
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:21,799
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can literally talk
to my subconscious.</font>

315
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:24,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's one of the ways we extract
information from the subject.</font>

316
00:29:25,012 --> 00:29:26,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">How else do you do it?</font>

317
00:29:26,513 --> 00:29:30,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">By creating something secure,
like a bank vault or a jail.</font>

318
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:34,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">The mind automatically fills it
with information it's trying to protect.</font>

319
00:29:34,521 --> 00:29:37,316
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You understand?
- Then you break in and steal it?</font>

320
00:29:37,482 --> 00:29:38,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well...</font>

321
00:29:38,692 --> 00:29:43,197
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess I thought that the dream space
would be all about the visual...</font>

322
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:45,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">but it's more about the feel of it.</font>

323
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:49,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">My question is what happens when you
start messing with the physics of it all?</font>

324
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:32,746
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's something, isn't it?</font>

325
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:35,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, it is.</font>

326
00:30:59,022 --> 00:31:00,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are they all looking at me?</font>

327
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:04,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because my subconscious feels that
someone else is creating this world.</font>

328
00:31:04,444 --> 00:31:08,740
<font color="#FFFFFF">The more you change things, the quicker
the projections start to converge on you.</font>

329
00:31:08,907 --> 00:31:09,950
<font color="#FFFFFF">Converge?</font>

330
00:31:10,117 --> 00:31:12,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">They sense the foreign nature
of the dreamer.</font>

331
00:31:12,369 --> 00:31:15,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">They attack, like white blood cells
fighting an infection.</font>

332
00:31:15,205 --> 00:31:18,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What, they're gonna attack us?
- No, no.</font>

333
00:31:18,625 --> 00:31:20,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just you.</font>

334
00:31:24,089 --> 00:31:28,343
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is great, but I'm telling you,
if you keep changing things like this...</font>

335
00:31:31,847 --> 00:31:34,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeez, mind telling your subconscious
to take it easy?</font>

336
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:37,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's my subconscious.
Remember? I can't control it.</font>

337
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:32,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very impressive.</font>

338
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:47,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know this bridge.
This place is real, isn't it?</font>

339
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:50,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I cross it every day
to get to the college.</font>

340
00:32:50,634 --> 00:32:54,054
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never re-create places from your memory.
Always imagine new places.</font>

341
00:32:54,221 --> 00:32:56,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">You draw from stuff you know, right?</font>

342
00:32:56,223 --> 00:33:00,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only use details. A streetlamp
or a phone booth. Never entire areas.</font>

343
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:02,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why not?
- Building a dream from your memory...</font>

344
00:33:02,896 --> 00:33:06,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">is the easiest way to lose your grasp
on what's real and what is a dream.</font>

345
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:08,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Is that what happened to you?
- Listen to me.</font>

346
00:33:08,819 --> 00:33:10,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">This has nothing to do
with me, understand?</font>

347
00:33:10,988 --> 00:33:12,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">That why you need me
to build your dreams?</font>

348
00:33:13,115 --> 00:33:15,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, get off of her. Back up. Back up.</font>

349
00:33:15,826 --> 00:33:17,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Cobb! Cobb!
- Get off of her!</font>

350
00:33:17,619 --> 00:33:19,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Let me go! Let me go!
- Mal!</font>

351
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mal!
- Cobb! Wake me up!</font>

352
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Wake me up! Wake me up!
- No!</font>

353
00:33:24,292 --> 00:33:25,794
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mal, no! No!
- Wake me up!</font>

354
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:31,424
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, hey, hey. Look at me.
You're okay. You're okay.</font>

355
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:34,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey.
- Why wouldn't I wake up?</font>

356
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:36,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">There was still time on the clock.</font>

357
00:33:36,888 --> 00:33:39,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't wake up from
within the dream unless you die.</font>

358
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:41,183
<font color="#FFFFFF">- She'll need a totem.
What?</font>

359
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">A totem, it's a small personal...</font>

360
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:45,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's some subconscious
you've got on you, Cobb!</font>

361
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">- She's a real charmer.
- Oh.</font>

362
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:50,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I see you met Mrs. Cobb.
- She's his wife?</font>

363
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:54,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. So a totem. You need
a small object, potentially heavy.</font>

364
00:33:54,406 --> 00:33:56,866
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something you can have on you
that no one else knows.</font>

365
00:33:57,034 --> 00:33:58,285
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like a coin?
No.</font>

366
00:33:58,452 --> 00:34:03,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">It needs to be more unique than that.
Like, this is a loaded die.</font>

367
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:07,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I can't let you touch it.
That would defeat the purpose.</font>

368
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:11,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">See, only I know the balance and
the weight of this particular loaded die.</font>

369
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:13,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">That way,
when you look at your totem...</font>

370
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:16,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">you know beyond a doubt that
you're not in someone else's dream.</font>

371
00:34:20,182 --> 00:34:24,478
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know if you can't see what's
going on, or if you just don't want to...</font>

372
00:34:24,644 --> 00:34:28,190
<font color="#FFFFFF">but Cobb has some serious problems
that he's tried to bury down there.</font>

373
00:34:28,356 --> 00:34:32,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'm not about to just open my mind
to someone like that.</font>

374
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:41,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">She'll be back. I've never seen anyone
pick it up that quickly before.</font>

375
00:34:42,329 --> 00:34:46,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Reality's not gonna be enough for her now,
and when she comes back...</font>

376
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">When she comes back,
you're gonna have her building mazes.</font>

377
00:34:50,003 --> 00:34:52,297
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Where are you gonna be?
- I gotta go visit Eames.</font>

378
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:55,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eames? No, he's in Mombasa.
It's Cobol's back yard.</font>

379
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a necessary risk.</font>

380
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:01,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, there's plenty of good thieves.
- We don't just need a thief.</font>

381
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:03,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need a forger.</font>

382
00:35:11,858 --> 00:35:14,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rub them together all you want,
they're not gonna breed.</font>

383
00:35:15,028 --> 00:35:16,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">You never know.</font>

384
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:19,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna get you a drink.</font>

385
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:22,536
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're buying.</font>

386
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:31,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Your spelling hasn't improved.
- Piss off.</font>

387
00:35:31,503 --> 00:35:33,463
<font color="#FFFFFF">How's your handwriting?</font>

388
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:35,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's versatile.
- Good.</font>

389
00:35:35,632 --> 00:35:36,882
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you very much.</font>

390
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:38,885
<font color="#FFFFFF">Inception.</font>

391
00:35:39,135 --> 00:35:41,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, before you bother telling me
it's impossible, let me...</font>

392
00:35:42,139 --> 00:35:45,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it's perfectly possible.
It's just bloody difficult.</font>

393
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:48,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">Interesting. Because Arthur keeps
telling me it can't be done.</font>

394
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:52,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm. Arthur. You still working
with that stick in the mud?</font>

395
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">He is good at what he does, right?</font>

396
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, he's the best,
but he has no imagination.</font>

397
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:57,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not like you.</font>

398
00:35:57,737 --> 00:36:00,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, if you're gonna perform inception,
you need imagination.</font>

399
00:36:00,907 --> 00:36:04,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me ask you something.
Have you done it before?</font>

400
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:08,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">We tried it. Uh, we got the idea in place,
but it didn't take.</font>

401
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:11,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You didn't plant it deep enough?
- No, it's not just about depth.</font>

402
00:36:11,918 --> 00:36:13,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">You need the simplest version
of the idea...</font>

403
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:17,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">in order for it to grow naturally
in your subject's mind. It's a subtle art.</font>

404
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:20,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, what is this idea
that you need to plant?</font>

405
00:36:20,635 --> 00:36:24,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need the heir of a major corporation
to dissolve his father's empire.</font>

406
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:27,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right there you have
various political motivations...</font>

407
00:36:27,601 --> 00:36:29,603
<font color="#FFFFFF">and anti-monopolistic sentiments
and so forth.</font>

408
00:36:29,769 --> 00:36:31,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">But all of that stuff, it's, um...</font>

409
00:36:31,771 --> 00:36:34,648
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's really at the mercy of your
subject's prejudice, you see?</font>

410
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:37,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">What you have to do is
start at the absolute basic.</font>

411
00:36:37,485 --> 00:36:39,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which is what?</font>

412
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:41,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">The relationship with the father.</font>

413
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:45,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do you have a chemist?
- No, not yet.</font>

414
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:48,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right. Okay, well,
there's a man here, Yusuf.</font>

415
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:52,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">He, uh, formulates his own versions
of the compounds.</font>

416
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:53,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you take me there?</font>

417
00:36:53,793 --> 00:36:56,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Once you've lost your tail.
The man at the bar.</font>

418
00:36:57,047 --> 00:36:58,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cobol Engineering.</font>

419
00:36:58,673 --> 00:37:01,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">That price on my head,
was that dead or alive?</font>

420
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:03,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't remember.
Let's see if he starts shooting.</font>

421
00:37:03,887 --> 00:37:07,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">Run interference. I'll meet you downstairs
in the bar in, say, uh, half an hour?</font>

422
00:37:07,682 --> 00:37:09,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Back here?
- This is the last place they'd suspect.</font>

423
00:37:12,228 --> 00:37:13,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

424
00:37:14,731 --> 00:37:16,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">Freddy. Freddy Simmonds.</font>

425
00:37:16,733 --> 00:37:18,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">My God, it's you, isn't it?</font>

426
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:22,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it isn't you.</font>

427
00:37:22,989 --> 00:37:24,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not dreaming now, are you?</font>

428
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,202
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get him!</font>

429
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:44,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">There!</font>

430
00:38:05,365 --> 00:38:07,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">One café.</font>

431
00:38:11,454 --> 00:38:12,621
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shh.</font>

432
00:38:18,253 --> 00:38:19,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">One café.</font>

433
00:38:20,755 --> 00:38:22,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">One café.</font>

434
00:39:16,811 --> 00:39:18,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">Care for a lift, Mr. Cobb?</font>

435
00:39:19,898 --> 00:39:23,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What are you doing in Mombasa?
- I'm here to protect my investment.</font>

436
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:29,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ah. So this is your idea
of losing a tail, huh?</font>

437
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:30,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">Different tail.</font>

438
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:41,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cobb said you'd be back.</font>

439
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:45,757
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I tried not to come, but...
- But there's nothing quite like it.</font>

440
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:47,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's just...</font>

441
00:39:49,094 --> 00:39:50,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">pure creation.</font>

442
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:53,097
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shall we take a look
at some paradoxical architecture?</font>

443
00:39:53,264 --> 00:39:55,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're gonna have to master
a few tricks...</font>

444
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:58,978
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you're gonna build three complete
dream levels. Excuse me.</font>

445
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:00,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">What kind of tricks?</font>

446
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:04,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">In a dream, you can cheat architecture
into impossible shapes.</font>

447
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:08,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">That lets you create closed loops,
like the Penrose Steps.</font>

448
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:09,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">The infinite staircase.</font>

449
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:15,327
<font color="#FFFFFF">See?</font>

450
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">Paradox.</font>

451
00:40:20,708 --> 00:40:22,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">So a closed loop like that...</font>

452
00:40:22,293 --> 00:40:25,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">will help you disguise the boundaries
of the dream you create.</font>

453
00:40:25,547 --> 00:40:27,507
<font color="#FFFFFF">But how big do these levels have to be?</font>

454
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:30,842
<font color="#FFFFFF">It could be anything from
the floor of a building to an entire city.</font>

455
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:34,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">They have to be complicated enough
that we can hide from the projections.</font>

456
00:40:34,597 --> 00:40:36,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">- A maze?
- Right, a maze.</font>

457
00:40:36,182 --> 00:40:37,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the better the maze...</font>

458
00:40:37,684 --> 00:40:40,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then the longer we have
before the projections catch us?</font>

459
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:41,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">Exactly.</font>

460
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:45,692
<font color="#FFFFFF">- My subconscious seems polite enough.
- Ha, ha. You wait, they'll turn ugly.</font>

461
00:40:47,777 --> 00:40:49,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one likes to feel someone else
messing around in their mind.</font>

462
00:40:49,362 --> 00:40:51,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cobb can't build anymore, can he?</font>

463
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:55,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know if he can't, but he won't.</font>

464
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">He thinks it's safer
if he doesn't know the layouts.</font>

465
00:40:57,871 --> 00:40:58,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why?</font>

466
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:01,373
<font color="#FFFFFF">He won't tell me. But I think it's Mal.</font>

467
00:41:01,791 --> 00:41:04,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">- His ex-wife?
- No, not his ex.</font>

468
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:07,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">- They're still together?
- No.</font>

469
00:41:08,673 --> 00:41:10,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, she's dead.</font>

470
00:41:12,135 --> 00:41:14,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">What you see in there
is just his projection of her.</font>

471
00:41:18,391 --> 00:41:19,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">What was she like in real life?</font>

472
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:21,936
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was lovely.</font>

473
00:41:25,773 --> 00:41:28,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are seeking a chemist?
Yes.</font>

474
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:30,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">To formulate compounds for a job?</font>

475
00:41:31,112 --> 00:41:32,989
<font color="#FFFFFF">And to go into the field with us.</font>

476
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,407
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I rarely go into the field, Mr. Cobb.</font>

477
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:39,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we'd need you there to tailor
compounds specific to our needs.</font>

478
00:41:39,454 --> 00:41:41,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Which are?
- Great depth.</font>

479
00:41:41,748 --> 00:41:45,001
<font color="#FFFFFF">A dream within a dream? Two levels?</font>

480
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:48,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three.</font>

481
00:41:48,963 --> 00:41:52,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not possible. That many dreams
within dreams is too unstable.</font>

482
00:41:52,717 --> 00:41:56,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is possible.
You just have to add a sedative.</font>

483
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:59,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">A powerful sedative.</font>

484
00:42:01,309 --> 00:42:03,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How many team members?
- Five.</font>

485
00:42:03,728 --> 00:42:05,438
<font color="#FFFFFF">Six.</font>

486
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:10,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">The only way to know you've done the job
is if I go in with you.</font>

487
00:42:10,527 --> 00:42:13,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no room for tourists
on a job like this, Mr. Saito.</font>

488
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:16,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">This time, it seems there is.</font>

489
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:20,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">This, I think, is a good place to start.
I use it every day.</font>

490
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:23,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">What for?
- Here, I'll show you.</font>

491
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:29,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps you will not want to see.</font>

492
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:33,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">After you.</font>

493
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:46,019
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ten. Twelve. All connected. Bloody hell.</font>

494
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:47,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">They come every day to share the dream.</font>

495
00:42:50,983 --> 00:42:53,568
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see? Very stable.</font>

496
00:42:59,284 --> 00:43:03,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How long do they dream for?
Three, four hours, each day.</font>

497
00:43:03,621 --> 00:43:04,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">In dream time?</font>

498
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:08,501
<font color="#FFFFFF">With this compound? About 40 hours,
each and every day.</font>

499
00:43:08,668 --> 00:43:11,963
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why do they do it?
Tell him, Mr. Cobb.</font>

500
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:15,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">After a while, it becomes
the only way you can dream.</font>

501
00:43:16,092 --> 00:43:18,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you still dream, Mr. Cobb?</font>

502
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:22,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">- They come here every day to sleep?
No.</font>

503
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:26,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">They come to be woken up.</font>

504
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:30,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">The dream has become their reality.</font>

505
00:43:31,733 --> 00:43:34,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who are you to say otherwise, sir?</font>

506
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:38,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's see what you can do.</font>

507
00:43:49,041 --> 00:43:50,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know how to find me.</font>

508
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:55,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what you have to do.</font>

509
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:01,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sharp, no?</font>

510
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:19,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you all right, Mr. Cobb?</font>

511
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:24,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, yeah. Everything's just fine.</font>

512
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:36,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robert Fischer, heir to the Fischer Morrow
energy conglomerate.</font>

513
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:38,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's your problem with this Mr. Fischer?</font>

514
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:40,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's not your concern.</font>

515
00:44:40,635 --> 00:44:45,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Saito, this isn't your typical
corporate espionage.</font>

516
00:44:45,181 --> 00:44:46,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">You asked me for inception.</font>

517
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:50,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">I do hope you understand
the gravity of that request.</font>

518
00:44:50,478 --> 00:44:54,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, the seed that we plant
in this man's mind will grow into an idea.</font>

519
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:56,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">This idea will define him.</font>

520
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:58,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">It may come to change...</font>

521
00:44:58,653 --> 00:45:00,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it may come to change
everything about him.</font>

522
00:45:01,114 --> 00:45:05,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're the last company standing
between them and total energy dominance.</font>

523
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:07,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we can no longer compete.</font>

524
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:11,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">Soon, they'll control the energy supply
of half the world.</font>

525
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">In effect, they become
a new superpower.</font>

526
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:18,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">The world needs Robert Fischer
to change his mind.</font>

527
00:45:18,798 --> 00:45:20,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's where we come in.</font>

528
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:23,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">How is Robert Fischer's relationship
with his father?</font>

529
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:26,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rumor is the relationship
is quite complicated.</font>

530
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:29,349
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, we can't work based
solely on rumor, can we?</font>

531
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:32,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you get me access to this man here?
Browning.</font>

532
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:37,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fischer Senior's right-hand man.
Fischer Junior's godfather.</font>

533
00:45:37,233 --> 00:45:40,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">It should be possible,
if you can get the right references.</font>

534
00:45:40,653 --> 00:45:45,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">References are something
of a specialty for me, Mr. Saito.</font>

535
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:48,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not smelling
settlement here. Take them down.</font>

536
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:49,996
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Browning...</font>

537
00:45:50,163 --> 00:45:54,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maurice Fischer's policy
is always one of avoiding litigation.</font>

538
00:45:56,545 --> 00:46:01,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, shall we voice your concerns
with Maurice directly?</font>

539
00:46:01,173 --> 00:46:02,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not sure that's necessary.</font>

540
00:46:02,759 --> 00:46:05,427
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no. I think we should.</font>

541
00:46:26,699 --> 00:46:28,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">How is he?</font>

542
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to bother him
unnecessarily, but...</font>

543
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:37,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robert, I told you keep out
the damn... Wait. So do it. Get...</font>

544
00:46:37,793 --> 00:46:40,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Fischer.
Put it through.</font>

545
00:46:41,255 --> 00:46:44,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never, never.
Never do the same as I asked.</font>

546
00:46:46,177 --> 00:46:47,844
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leave that.</font>

547
00:46:51,557 --> 00:46:52,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here.</font>

548
00:46:55,186 --> 00:46:57,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">Must be a cherished memory of his.</font>

549
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:03,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">I put it beside his bed.
He hasn't even noticed.</font>

550
00:47:03,402 --> 00:47:05,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robert...</font>

551
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:09,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">we need to talk about
a power of attorney.</font>

552
00:47:09,992 --> 00:47:13,286
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I know this is hard, but it's imperative...
- Not now, Uncle Peter.</font>

553
00:47:17,291 --> 00:47:19,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">The vultures are circling.</font>

554
00:47:19,251 --> 00:47:23,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the sicker Maurice Fischer becomes,
the more powerful Peter Browning becomes.</font>

555
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:26,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've had ample opportunity
to observe Browning...</font>

556
00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:31,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">and adopt his physical presence, study
his mannerisms, and so on and so forth.</font>

557
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:35,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">So now in the first layer of the dream,
I can impersonate Browning.</font>

558
00:47:35,434 --> 00:47:38,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">And suggest concepts
to Fischer's conscious mind.</font>

559
00:47:38,855 --> 00:47:40,690
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then, when we take him
a level deeper...</font>

560
00:47:40,856 --> 00:47:44,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">his own projection of Browning
should feed that right back to him.</font>

561
00:47:44,527 --> 00:47:46,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">So he gives himself the idea.</font>

562
00:47:46,612 --> 00:47:50,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Precisely. That's the only way it will stick.
It has to seem self-generated.</font>

563
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:54,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eames, I am impressed.</font>

564
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:58,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your condescension, as always,
is much appreciated, Arthur, thank you.</font>

565
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:21,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">Were you going under on your own?</font>

566
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:25,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, I was just, uh, running
some experiments.</font>

567
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,318
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't realize anyone was here, so...</font>

568
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:30,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I was just...
I was working on my totem, actually.</font>

569
00:48:30,322 --> 00:48:31,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here, let me take a look.</font>

570
00:48:33,659 --> 00:48:34,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you're learning, huh?</font>

571
00:48:35,161 --> 00:48:38,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">An elegant solution
for keeping track of reality.</font>

572
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:41,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Was it your idea?
- No, it was, uh...</font>

573
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:44,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was Mal's, actually. This...</font>

574
00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:48,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">This one was hers. She would spin it
in the dream and it would never topple.</font>

575
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:51,552
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just spin and spin.</font>

576
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:55,014
<font color="#FFFFFF">Arthur told me she passed away.</font>

577
00:48:56,932 --> 00:48:59,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">How are the mazes coming along?</font>

578
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:02,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">Each level relates to the part
of the subject's subconscious...</font>

579
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:03,688
<font color="#FFFFFF">that we are trying to access.</font>

580
00:49:03,856 --> 00:49:09,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I'm making the bottom level a hospital,
so Fischer will bring his father.</font>

581
00:49:09,695 --> 00:49:12,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, l... Actually, I have a question
about this layout.</font>

582
00:49:12,615 --> 00:49:17,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no. Don't show me specifics.
Only the dreamer should know the layout.</font>

583
00:49:17,536 --> 00:49:18,704
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why is that so important?</font>

584
00:49:18,871 --> 00:49:20,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">In case one of us brings in
our projections.</font>

585
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:23,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't want them knowing
the details of the maze.</font>

586
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:27,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">You mean in case you bring Mal in.</font>

587
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:29,798
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't keep her out, can you?</font>

588
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:32,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Right.
- You can't build...</font>

589
00:49:32,385 --> 00:49:35,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">because if you know the maze,
then she knows it.</font>

590
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:38,056
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, she'd sabotage
the whole operation.</font>

591
00:49:38,224 --> 00:49:41,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Cobb, do the others know?
- No. No, they don't.</font>

592
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:43,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've gotta warn them
if this is getting worse.</font>

593
00:49:43,605 --> 00:49:45,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">No one said it's getting worse.</font>

594
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:50,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need to get home.
That's all I care about right now.</font>

595
00:49:50,903 --> 00:49:52,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why can't you go home?</font>

596
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:58,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because they think I killed her.</font>

597
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:03,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Thank you.
- For what?</font>

598
00:50:03,833 --> 00:50:06,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">For not asking whether I did.</font>

599
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:08,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">"I will split up my father's empire."</font>

600
00:50:08,588 --> 00:50:12,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, this is obviously an idea that
Robert himself would choose to reject...</font>

601
00:50:12,967 --> 00:50:15,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">which is why we need to plant it deep
in his subconscious.</font>

602
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:19,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">The subconscious is motivated
by emotion, right? Not reason.</font>

603
00:50:19,641 --> 00:50:23,434
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to find a way to translate this
into an emotional concept.</font>

604
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:26,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you translate business strategy
into emotion?</font>

605
00:50:26,188 --> 00:50:29,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what we're here to figure out.
Robert's relationship with his father...</font>

606
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:32,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">is stressed, to say the least.
- Can we run with that?</font>

607
00:50:32,862 --> 00:50:36,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">We suggest breaking up his father's
company as a "screw you" to the old man.</font>

608
00:50:36,615 --> 00:50:40,119
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, because I think positive emotion
trumps negative emotion every time.</font>

609
00:50:40,494 --> 00:50:44,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">We all yearn for reconciliation,
for catharsis.</font>

610
00:50:44,373 --> 00:50:48,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need Robert Fischer to have
a positive emotional reaction to all this.</font>

611
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:50,128
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, well, try this. Um...</font>

612
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:55,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">"My father accepts that I want to create
for myself, not follow in his footsteps."</font>

613
00:50:55,467 --> 00:50:56,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">That might work.</font>

614
00:50:56,677 --> 00:50:59,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">Might? We're gonna need to do
a little better than "might."</font>

615
00:51:00,014 --> 00:51:01,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you for your contribution, Arthur.</font>

616
00:51:02,141 --> 00:51:05,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forgive me for wanting
a little specificity, Eames.</font>

617
00:51:05,311 --> 00:51:06,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Specificity?</font>

618
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:08,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">Inception's not about being specific.</font>

619
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:12,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">When we get inside his mind, we're
gonna have to work with what we find.</font>

620
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:16,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">On the top level, we open up
his relationship with his father...</font>

621
00:51:16,989 --> 00:51:20,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">and say, "I will not follow
in my father's footsteps."</font>

622
00:51:20,242 --> 00:51:24,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then the next level down, we feed him,
"I will create something for myself."</font>

623
00:51:25,081 --> 00:51:28,416
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then, by the time we hit the bottom level,
we bring out the big guns.</font>

624
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:31,003
<font color="#FFFFFF">- "My father doesn't want me to be him."
Exactly.</font>

625
00:51:32,338 --> 00:51:36,342
<font color="#FFFFFF">Three layers down, the dreams are gonna
collapse with the slightest disturbance.</font>

626
00:51:36,509 --> 00:51:37,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sedation.</font>

627
00:51:37,844 --> 00:51:40,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">For sleep stable enough to create
three layers of dreaming...</font>

628
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:44,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">we'll have to combine it with
an extremely powerful sedative.</font>

629
00:51:56,195 --> 00:51:57,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good night.</font>

630
00:51:57,864 --> 00:52:00,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">The compound we'll be using
to share the dream...</font>

631
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:02,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">creates a clear connection
between dreamers...</font>

632
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:06,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">whilst accelerating brain function.
- In other words, more time on each level.</font>

633
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:09,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Brain function in the dream will be
about 20 times normal.</font>

634
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:13,586
<font color="#FFFFFF">And when you enter a dream within
that dream, the effect is compounded.</font>

635
00:52:13,755 --> 00:52:15,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's three dreams,
that's 10 hours times 20...</font>

636
00:52:16,048 --> 00:52:18,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">Math was never my strong subject.
How much time is that?</font>

637
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:21,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a week, the first level down.</font>

638
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:25,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">Six months the second level down,
and the third level...</font>

639
00:52:25,474 --> 00:52:26,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's 10 years.</font>

640
00:52:29,561 --> 00:52:31,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who'd wanna be stuck
in a dream for 10 years?</font>

641
00:52:32,106 --> 00:52:33,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">Depends on the dream.</font>

642
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">So once we've made the plant,
how do we get out?</font>

643
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:39,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm hoping you have something more
elegant than shooting me in the head.</font>

644
00:52:39,405 --> 00:52:42,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">- A kick.
- What's a kick?</font>

645
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:45,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">This, Ariadne, would be a kick.</font>

646
00:52:47,204 --> 00:52:49,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's that feeling of falling you get
that jolts you awake.</font>

647
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:53,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Snaps you out of the dream.
- We gonna feel a kick with this sedation?</font>

648
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:54,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the clever part.</font>

649
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:58,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">I customized the sedative to leave
inner-ear function unimpaired.</font>

650
00:52:58,257 --> 00:53:03,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">That way, however deep the sleep,
the sleeper still feels falling.</font>

651
00:53:03,262 --> 00:53:05,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or tipping.</font>

652
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:10,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">The trick is to synchronize a kick
that can penetrate all three levels.</font>

653
00:53:10,936 --> 00:53:14,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">We could use a musical countdown
to synchronize the different kicks.</font>

654
00:53:22,364 --> 00:53:25,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">He hasn't got any surgery
scheduled, no dental, nothing.</font>

655
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:28,036
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wasn't he supposed to have
a knee operation?</font>

656
00:53:28,204 --> 00:53:31,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing. Nothing that they'll
put him under for, anyway. And we need...</font>

657
00:53:31,623 --> 00:53:33,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need at least a good 10 hours.</font>

658
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:35,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sydney to Los Angeles.</font>

659
00:53:36,378 --> 00:53:40,632
<font color="#FFFFFF">One of the longest flights in the world.
He makes it every two weeks.</font>

660
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,967
<font color="#FFFFFF">He must be flying private, then.</font>

661
00:53:43,469 --> 00:53:46,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not if there were unexpected
maintenance with his plane.</font>

662
00:53:46,806 --> 00:53:49,057
<font color="#FFFFFF">It would have to be a 747.
- Why's that?</font>

663
00:53:49,224 --> 00:53:50,684
<font color="#FFFFFF">On a 747, the pilot's up top...</font>

664
00:53:50,851 --> 00:53:54,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">the first-class cabin's in the nose,
so no one would walk through.</font>

665
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:57,733
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'd have to buy out the entire cabin
and the first-class flight attendant.</font>

666
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">I bought the airline.</font>

667
00:54:01,028 --> 00:54:02,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">It seemed neater.</font>

668
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:07,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, looks like we have our 10 hours.</font>

669
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:11,038
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ariadne? Terrific work, by the way.</font>

670
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:01,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know how to find me.</font>

671
00:55:02,715 --> 00:55:04,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what you have to do.</font>

672
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:11,431
<font color="#FFFFFF">You remember when you asked me
to marry you?</font>

673
00:55:12,307 --> 00:55:14,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course I do.</font>

674
00:55:15,436 --> 00:55:17,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said you had a dream.</font>

675
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:23,652
<font color="#FFFFFF">That we'd grow old together.</font>

676
00:55:25,070 --> 00:55:26,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we can.</font>

677
00:55:33,454 --> 00:55:35,414
<font color="#FFFFFF">You shouldn't be here.</font>

678
00:55:39,168 --> 00:55:42,628
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just wanted to see what kind of tests
you're doing on your own every night.</font>

679
00:55:42,797 --> 00:55:46,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This has nothing to do with you.
- This has everything to do with me.</font>

680
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:51,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You've asked me to share dreams with you.
- Not these. These are my dreams.</font>

681
00:56:02,858 --> 00:56:05,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you do this to yourself?</font>

682
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:08,362
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's the only way I can still dream.</font>

683
00:56:10,115 --> 00:56:12,326
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why is it so important to dream?</font>

684
00:56:13,244 --> 00:56:15,496
<font color="#FFFFFF">In my dreams, we're still together.</font>

685
00:56:29,844 --> 00:56:31,594
<font color="#FFFFFF">These aren't just dreams.</font>

686
00:56:33,389 --> 00:56:36,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">These are memories.
And you said never to use memories.</font>

687
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:37,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know I did.</font>

688
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:42,813
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're trying to keep her alive.
You can't let her go.</font>

689
00:56:42,981 --> 00:56:45,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't understand.
These are moments I regret.</font>

690
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:48,737
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're memories that I have to change.</font>

691
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:52,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, what's down there that you regret?</font>

692
00:56:52,824 --> 00:56:55,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, there's only one thing
you need to understand about me.</font>

693
00:57:04,461 --> 00:57:06,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is your house?</font>

694
00:57:06,713 --> 00:57:09,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mine and Mal's, yes.</font>

695
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:11,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is she?</font>

696
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:13,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's already gone.</font>

697
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:20,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's my son, James.</font>

698
00:57:20,186 --> 00:57:23,271
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's digging for something,
maybe a worm.</font>

699
00:57:24,648 --> 00:57:25,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's Phillipa.</font>

700
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:28,193
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought about calling out to them...</font>

701
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:31,112
<font color="#FFFFFF">so they'd turn and smile
and I could see...</font>

702
00:57:31,822 --> 00:57:36,952
<font color="#FFFFFF">those beautiful faces of theirs,
but it's all too late.</font>

703
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:39,954
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right now or never, Cobb.</font>

704
00:57:44,418 --> 00:57:46,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I start to panic.</font>

705
00:57:46,378 --> 00:57:49,088
<font color="#FFFFFF">I realize I'm gonna regret this moment...</font>

706
00:57:49,923 --> 00:57:52,259
<font color="#FFFFFF">that I need to see their faces
one last time.</font>

707
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:54,927
<font color="#FFFFFF">James! Phillipa! Come on in!</font>

708
00:57:55,096 --> 00:57:57,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the moment's past.</font>

709
00:57:59,349 --> 00:58:02,728
<font color="#FFFFFF">And whatever I do,
I can't change this moment.</font>

710
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:05,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">As I'm about to call out to them...</font>

711
00:58:06,815 --> 00:58:07,898
<font color="#FFFFFF">they run away.</font>

712
00:58:10,652 --> 00:58:13,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I'm ever gonna see their faces again,
I've gotta get back home.</font>

713
00:58:14,949 --> 00:58:16,449
<font color="#FFFFFF">The real world.</font>

714
00:58:58,034 --> 00:58:59,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing here?</font>

715
00:59:00,327 --> 00:59:01,452
<font color="#FFFFFF">My name is...</font>

716
00:59:01,621 --> 00:59:04,914
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know who you are.
What are you doing here?</font>

717
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:15,509
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm just trying to understand.</font>

718
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:17,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">How could you understand?</font>

719
00:59:19,012 --> 00:59:21,139
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you know what it is to be a lover?</font>

720
00:59:23,141 --> 00:59:25,309
<font color="#FFFFFF">To be half of a whole?</font>

721
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:28,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

722
00:59:29,565 --> 00:59:31,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll tell you a riddle.</font>

723
00:59:33,027 --> 00:59:35,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're waiting for a train.</font>

724
00:59:36,364 --> 00:59:39,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">A train that will take you far away.</font>

725
00:59:40,909 --> 00:59:43,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know where you hope
this train will take you...</font>

726
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:47,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you don't know for sure.</font>

727
00:59:47,333 --> 00:59:49,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it doesn't matter.</font>

728
00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:53,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">How can it not matter to you
where that train will take you?</font>

729
00:59:53,797 --> 00:59:55,548
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because you'll be together.</font>

730
00:59:56,592 --> 00:59:59,677
<font color="#FFFFFF">How could you bring her here, Dom?
- What is this place?</font>

731
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:03,264
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a hotel suite where we
used to spend our anniversary.</font>

732
01:00:03,432 --> 01:00:04,766
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened here?</font>

733
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:09,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">You promised!
You promised we'd be together!</font>

734
01:00:09,938 --> 01:00:12,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please, I need you to stay here
just for now!</font>

735
01:00:12,190 --> 01:00:15,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said we'd be together!
You said we'd grow old together!</font>

736
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:18,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll come back for you. I promise.</font>

737
01:00:36,257 --> 01:00:41,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think you can just build
a prison of memories to lock her in?</font>

738
01:00:42,262 --> 01:00:44,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you really think that
that's gonna contain her?</font>

739
01:00:45,557 --> 01:00:46,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's time.</font>

740
01:00:48,059 --> 01:00:50,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maurice Fischer just died in Sydney.</font>

741
01:00:50,563 --> 01:00:52,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">- When's the funeral?
- Thursday. In Los Angeles.</font>

742
01:00:52,898 --> 01:00:56,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robert should accompany the body
no later than Tuesday. We should move.</font>

743
01:00:56,318 --> 01:00:57,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

744
01:00:58,403 --> 01:01:01,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Cobb, I'm coming with you.
- I promised Miles. No.</font>

745
01:01:01,574 --> 01:01:04,742
<font color="#FFFFFF">The team needs someone who
understands what you're struggling with.</font>

746
01:01:07,288 --> 01:01:09,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">And it doesn't have to be me...</font>

747
01:01:09,623 --> 01:01:12,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">but then you have to show Arthur
what I just saw.</font>

748
01:01:18,715 --> 01:01:20,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get us another seat on the plane.</font>

749
01:01:24,472 --> 01:01:27,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I get on this plane
and you don't honor our agreement...</font>

750
01:01:27,682 --> 01:01:31,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">when we land,
I go to jail for the rest of my life.</font>

751
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:34,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">Complete the job en route...</font>

752
01:01:34,398 --> 01:01:36,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">I make one phone call from the plane...</font>

753
01:01:37,025 --> 01:01:39,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">you have no trouble
getting through lmmigration.</font>

754
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:56,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm sorry.
- Oh, yeah, absolutely.</font>

755
01:01:56,336 --> 01:01:57,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

756
01:02:31,496 --> 01:02:34,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excuse me, I think this is yours?
You must have dropped it.</font>

757
01:02:35,001 --> 01:02:36,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you care for a drink?</font>

758
01:02:37,043 --> 01:02:38,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh. Water, please.</font>

759
01:02:38,503 --> 01:02:40,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, um, same, please.</font>

760
01:02:41,798 --> 01:02:43,090
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um...</font>

761
01:02:43,842 --> 01:02:44,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

762
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:46,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I couldn't help but notice...</font>

763
01:02:47,137 --> 01:02:50,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you wouldn't happen to be related
to the Maurice Fischer, would you?</font>

764
01:02:50,891 --> 01:02:52,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, he, um...</font>

765
01:02:53,351 --> 01:02:55,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was my father.</font>

766
01:02:55,771 --> 01:02:59,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, he was a very inspiring figure.
I'm sorry for your loss.</font>

767
01:03:02,777 --> 01:03:04,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Here you go.
- Thank you.</font>

768
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:05,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

769
01:03:06,364 --> 01:03:07,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">To your father.</font>

770
01:03:08,576 --> 01:03:10,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">May he rest in peace, huh?</font>

771
01:04:19,271 --> 01:04:21,606
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Couldn't have peed before you went under?
- Sorry.</font>

772
01:04:21,773 --> 01:04:23,817
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bit too much free champagne
before takeoff?</font>

773
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:25,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ha, ha, bloody ha.</font>

774
01:04:25,277 --> 01:04:28,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">We know he's gonna be looking for a taxi
in this weather.</font>

775
01:04:39,916 --> 01:04:43,961
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Asshole! Hey, man, why don't you try...?
- Walk away.</font>

776
01:04:59,811 --> 01:05:01,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just have him ca... I gotta go.</font>

777
01:05:01,396 --> 01:05:03,523
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. Taxi. Thank you.</font>

778
01:05:06,485 --> 01:05:09,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, Third and Market. Snappy.</font>

779
01:05:09,905 --> 01:05:12,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What are you doing?
- Sorry, I thought it was free.</font>

780
01:05:12,407 --> 01:05:13,907
<font color="#FFFFFF">- It's not.
- Maybe we could share.</font>

781
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:16,911
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe not.
Can you pull over and get this...?</font>

782
01:05:19,873 --> 01:05:21,206
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great.</font>

783
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:27,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

784
01:05:38,726 --> 01:05:41,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's $500 in there.
The wallet's worth more than that.</font>

785
01:05:41,519 --> 01:05:43,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">You might at least
drop me at my stop.</font>

786
01:05:43,396 --> 01:05:44,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm afraid that it doesn't...</font>

787
01:05:54,199 --> 01:05:56,034
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Cover him!
Down! Down now!</font>

788
01:05:56,202 --> 01:05:57,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell is going on?</font>

789
01:06:01,539 --> 01:06:03,791
<font color="#FFFFFF">This wasn't in the design.</font>

790
01:06:04,710 --> 01:06:06,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cobb?</font>

791
01:06:06,336 --> 01:06:07,378
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cobb?</font>

792
01:06:58,264 --> 01:06:59,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get him!</font>

793
01:07:06,146 --> 01:07:07,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you all right?</font>

794
01:07:07,773 --> 01:07:09,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.</font>

795
01:07:10,108 --> 01:07:12,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fischer's okay, unless he gets carsick.</font>

796
01:07:12,193 --> 01:07:13,443
<font color="#FFFFFF">Saito?</font>

797
01:07:32,338 --> 01:07:34,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get Fischer in the back room now.</font>

798
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:37,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Get him in the back room. Move.
What the hell happened?</font>

799
01:07:37,927 --> 01:07:39,387
<font color="#FFFFFF">Has he been shot? Is he dying?</font>

800
01:07:39,554 --> 01:07:41,306
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.
- Jesus Christ.</font>

801
01:07:41,472 --> 01:07:43,891
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened to you?
- Blocked by a freight train.</font>

802
01:07:44,059 --> 01:07:46,018
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why put a train
in a downtown intersection?</font>

803
01:07:46,186 --> 01:07:47,811
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I didn't.
Where'd it come from?</font>

804
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:49,646
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why the hell were we ambushed?</font>

805
01:07:49,815 --> 01:07:52,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those were not normal projections.
They'd been trained, for God's sakes.</font>

806
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:55,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How could he be trained?
- Fischer's had an extractor...</font>

807
01:07:56,112 --> 01:08:00,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">teach his subconscious to defend itself,
so his subconscious is militarized.</font>

808
01:08:00,492 --> 01:08:02,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">It should've shown in the research.</font>

809
01:08:02,286 --> 01:08:04,077
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why the hell didn't it?
- Calm down.</font>

810
01:08:04,246 --> 01:08:05,579
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't tell me to calm down!</font>

811
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:08,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">This was your job, goddamn it!
This was your responsibility!</font>

812
01:08:08,833 --> 01:08:10,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were meant to check
Fischer's background!</font>

813
01:08:11,085 --> 01:08:14,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We are not prepared for this!
- We have dealt with sub-security before!</font>

814
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:16,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll be more careful
and we're gonna be fine!</font>

815
01:08:16,841 --> 01:08:18,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">This was not a part of the plan!
He's dying.</font>

816
01:08:18,844 --> 01:08:19,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">Put him out his misery.</font>

817
01:08:20,054 --> 01:08:22,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, don't do that! Don't do that.
- Cobb, hey, hey.</font>

818
01:08:23,056 --> 01:08:25,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's in agony. I'm waking him up.</font>

819
01:08:25,350 --> 01:08:27,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. It won't wake him up.</font>

820
01:08:27,394 --> 01:08:31,021
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you mean, it won't wake him up?
When we die in a dream, we wake up.</font>

821
01:08:31,189 --> 01:08:32,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not from this.</font>

822
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:35,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're too heavily sedated
to wake up that way.</font>

823
01:08:35,735 --> 01:08:37,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right. So, what happens when we die?</font>

824
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:39,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We drop into limbo.
- Are you serious?</font>

825
01:08:39,614 --> 01:08:42,158
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Limbo?
Unconstructed dream space.</font>

826
01:08:42,326 --> 01:08:45,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">What the hell is down there?
- Just raw, infinite subconscious.</font>

827
01:08:45,746 --> 01:08:48,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nothing is down there, except for
what might have been left behind...</font>

828
01:08:49,123 --> 01:08:52,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">by anyone sharing the dream
who's been trapped there before.</font>

829
01:08:52,211 --> 01:08:54,087
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which, in our case, is just you.</font>

830
01:08:54,253 --> 01:08:56,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How long could we be stuck?
Can't even think about...</font>

831
01:08:57,131 --> 01:08:59,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">trying to escape until the sedation...
- How long?</font>

832
01:08:59,717 --> 01:09:02,929
<font color="#FFFFFF">Decades. It could be infinite.
Ask him, he's the one who's been there.</font>

833
01:09:03,096 --> 01:09:04,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's get him upstairs.</font>

834
01:09:05,932 --> 01:09:07,391
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great.</font>

835
01:09:08,394 --> 01:09:09,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

836
01:09:10,561 --> 01:09:13,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">So now we're trapped in Fischer's mind,
battling his own private army.</font>

837
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:15,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if we get killed...</font>

838
01:09:15,609 --> 01:09:18,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">we'll be lost in limbo till our brains
turn to scrambled egg, hmm?</font>

839
01:09:25,743 --> 01:09:27,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone got first aid?</font>

840
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:33,292
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You knew these risks and didn't tell us?
- There weren't meant to be risks.</font>

841
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:36,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I didn't know we'd be dealing with gunfire.
- You had no right.</font>

842
01:09:36,587 --> 01:09:38,922
<font color="#FFFFFF">This was the only way
to go three layers deep.</font>

843
01:09:39,091 --> 01:09:41,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">You knew about this
and went along with it?</font>

844
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:42,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">I trusted him.</font>

845
01:09:42,469 --> 01:09:44,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">When? When he promised you
half his share?</font>

846
01:09:44,555 --> 01:09:47,806
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. His whole share.
Besides, he said he'd done it before.</font>

847
01:09:47,975 --> 01:09:50,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">What, with Mal?
Because that worked so good?</font>

848
01:09:50,226 --> 01:09:53,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">That has nothing to do with it.
I did what I had to to get to my children.</font>

849
01:09:53,814 --> 01:09:55,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">You led us into a war zone
with no way out?</font>

850
01:09:55,899 --> 01:09:59,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is a way out. We continue on with
the job, and we do it as fast as possible...</font>

851
01:10:00,112 --> 01:10:02,447
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we get out using the kick,
just like before.</font>

852
01:10:02,613 --> 01:10:05,073
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forget it. We go any deeper,
we just raise the stakes.</font>

853
01:10:05,242 --> 01:10:07,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am sitting this one out on this level.</font>

854
01:10:07,286 --> 01:10:09,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fischer's security
is surrounding this place.</font>

855
01:10:09,872 --> 01:10:12,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ten hours of flight time
is a week at this level.</font>

856
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:16,043
<font color="#FFFFFF">That means each and every one of us
will be killed. That I can guarantee you.</font>

857
01:10:16,627 --> 01:10:20,422
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have no other choice but to continue on
and do it as fast as possible.</font>

858
01:10:22,009 --> 01:10:24,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">Downwards is the only way forwards.</font>

859
01:10:26,012 --> 01:10:27,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get ready.</font>

860
01:10:27,305 --> 01:10:29,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">You, come on. Let's go shake him up.</font>

861
01:10:34,354 --> 01:10:37,398
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm insured against kidnapping
for up to 10 million.</font>

862
01:10:37,565 --> 01:10:40,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This should be very simple.
Shut up! It won't be.</font>

863
01:10:40,652 --> 01:10:42,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">In your father's office,
below the bookshelves...</font>

864
01:10:43,113 --> 01:10:45,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">is his personal safe.
We need the combination.</font>

865
01:10:46,533 --> 01:10:47,949
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know any safe.</font>

866
01:10:48,159 --> 01:10:50,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">That doesn't mean
you don't know the combination.</font>

867
01:10:52,663 --> 01:10:53,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tell us what it is.</font>

868
01:10:54,832 --> 01:10:56,583
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know.</font>

869
01:11:01,506 --> 01:11:03,673
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have it on good authority
you do know.</font>

870
01:11:03,841 --> 01:11:06,176
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah? Whose authority?</font>

871
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:11,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Five hundred dollars, this cost.
What's inside it?</font>

872
01:11:11,432 --> 01:11:15,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cash, cards, ID. And this.</font>

873
01:11:20,234 --> 01:11:21,734
<font color="#FFFFFF">Useful?</font>

874
01:11:22,485 --> 01:11:23,528
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe.</font>

875
01:11:23,987 --> 01:11:25,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're on. You've got an hour.</font>

876
01:11:26,198 --> 01:11:27,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">An hour?</font>

877
01:11:28,533 --> 01:11:30,784
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was supposed to have all night
to crack this.</font>

878
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:33,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">And Saito wasn't supposed
to be shot in the chest.</font>

879
01:11:33,704 --> 01:11:36,873
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've got one hour,
now get us something useful, please.</font>

880
01:11:39,418 --> 01:11:41,878
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What's that?
- Good authority.</font>

881
01:11:46,092 --> 01:11:47,801
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uncle Peter.</font>

882
01:11:48,511 --> 01:11:50,637
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just make them stop.</font>

883
01:11:50,930 --> 01:11:53,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">- The combination.
- I don't know it.</font>

884
01:11:53,432 --> 01:11:56,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why does Browning say you do?
- I don't know.</font>

885
01:11:56,270 --> 01:11:58,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just let me talk to him
and I'll find out.</font>

886
01:12:01,108 --> 01:12:03,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have one hour. Start talking.</font>

887
01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:07,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">You all right?</font>

888
01:12:08,907 --> 01:12:10,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">You okay?</font>

889
01:12:13,912 --> 01:12:17,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">Those bastards have had at me
for two days.</font>

890
01:12:18,250 --> 01:12:20,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">They have someone with access
to your father's office.</font>

891
01:12:20,918 --> 01:12:22,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">- They're trying to open his safe.
- Yeah.</font>

892
01:12:22,921 --> 01:12:25,672
<font color="#FFFFFF">They thought I'd know the combination,
but I don't know it.</font>

893
01:12:25,841 --> 01:12:28,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Yeah, well, neither do I, so...
- What?</font>

894
01:12:29,344 --> 01:12:32,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maurice told me that when he passed,
you were the only one able to open it.</font>

895
01:12:32,764 --> 01:12:35,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, he never gave me any combination.</font>

896
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:40,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe he did. I mean, maybe you
just didn't know it was a combination.</font>

897
01:12:40,314 --> 01:12:41,521
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, what, then?</font>

898
01:12:41,689 --> 01:12:44,233
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know, some meaningful
combination of numbers...</font>

899
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:48,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">based on your experiences
with Maurice.</font>

900
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:53,951
<font color="#FFFFFF">We didn't have very many, uh,
meaningful experiences together.</font>

901
01:12:54,703 --> 01:12:56,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps after your mother died.</font>

902
01:12:58,832 --> 01:13:01,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">After my mother died,
you know what he told me?</font>

903
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:08,173
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Robert,
there's really nothing to be said."</font>

904
01:13:08,341 --> 01:13:10,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, well, he was bad with emotion.</font>

905
01:13:10,844 --> 01:13:13,554
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was 11, Uncle Peter.</font>

906
01:13:14,305 --> 01:13:17,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How's he doing?
- He's in a lot of pain.</font>

907
01:13:17,725 --> 01:13:21,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">When we get down to the lower levels,
the pain will be less intense.</font>

908
01:13:21,479 --> 01:13:22,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if he dies?</font>

909
01:13:23,899 --> 01:13:25,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Worst-case scenario?</font>

910
01:13:25,524 --> 01:13:28,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">When he wakes up,
his mind is completely gone.</font>

911
01:13:28,403 --> 01:13:32,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cobb, I'll still honor the arrangement.</font>

912
01:13:32,658 --> 01:13:34,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">I appreciate that, Saito.</font>

913
01:13:34,493 --> 01:13:38,578
<font color="#FFFFFF">But when you wake up, you won't even
remember that we had an arrangement.</font>

914
01:13:38,747 --> 01:13:40,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">Limbo is gonna become your reality.</font>

915
01:13:40,957 --> 01:13:44,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're gonna be lost down there so long
that you're gonna become an old man.</font>

916
01:13:45,170 --> 01:13:46,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">Filled with regret?</font>

917
01:13:47,965 --> 01:13:49,047
<font color="#FFFFFF">Waiting to die alone.</font>

918
01:13:49,716 --> 01:13:50,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

919
01:13:51,385 --> 01:13:53,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll come back.</font>

920
01:13:53,845 --> 01:13:56,514
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we'll be young men together again.</font>

921
01:14:02,479 --> 01:14:03,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">Breathe.</font>

922
01:14:03,689 --> 01:14:06,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">These people are gonna kill us
if we don't give them the combination.</font>

923
01:14:06,899 --> 01:14:08,818
<font color="#FFFFFF">- They just wanna ransom us.
- I heard them.</font>

924
01:14:08,985 --> 01:14:12,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're gonna lock us in that van,
and then drive it into the river.</font>

925
01:14:13,030 --> 01:14:14,532
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. What is in the safe?</font>

926
01:14:15,617 --> 01:14:16,783
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something for you.</font>

927
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:21,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maurice always said
it was his most precious gift to you.</font>

928
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:25,376
<font color="#FFFFFF">- A will.
- Maurice's will is with Port and Dunn.</font>

929
01:14:25,543 --> 01:14:26,752
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's an alternate.</font>

930
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:29,296
<font color="#FFFFFF">This would supersede the other
if you want it to.</font>

931
01:14:29,463 --> 01:14:32,091
<font color="#FFFFFF">It splits up the component businesses
of Fischer Morrow.</font>

932
01:14:32,259 --> 01:14:35,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">It'd be the end of the entire empire
as we know it.</font>

933
01:14:36,137 --> 01:14:38,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">Destroying my whole inheritance?</font>

934
01:14:40,266 --> 01:14:43,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why would he suggest such a thing?
- I just don't know.</font>

935
01:14:46,314 --> 01:14:48,274
<font color="#FFFFFF">He loved you, Robert.</font>

936
01:14:48,859 --> 01:14:50,484
<font color="#FFFFFF">In his own way.</font>

937
01:14:50,652 --> 01:14:52,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">In his own way.</font>

938
01:14:53,738 --> 01:14:55,280
<font color="#FFFFFF">At the end...</font>

939
01:14:56,408 --> 01:14:58,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">he called me in to his deathbed.</font>

940
01:14:59,243 --> 01:15:01,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">He could barely speak.</font>

941
01:15:02,163 --> 01:15:06,417
<font color="#FFFFFF">But he took the trouble
to tell me one last thing.</font>

942
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:10,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">He pulled me close.</font>

943
01:15:13,216 --> 01:15:15,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I could only make out...</font>

944
01:15:16,177 --> 01:15:17,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">one word.</font>

945
01:15:21,307 --> 01:15:23,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Disappointed."</font>

946
01:15:28,939 --> 01:15:30,106
<font color="#FFFFFF">When were you in limbo?</font>

947
01:15:31,693 --> 01:15:35,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">You might have the rest of the team
convinced to carry on with this job.</font>

948
01:15:35,363 --> 01:15:37,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">- But they don't know the truth.
- Truth? What truth?</font>

949
01:15:37,948 --> 01:15:42,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">The truth that, at any minute, you might
bring a freight train through the wall.</font>

950
01:15:42,244 --> 01:15:46,289
<font color="#FFFFFF">The truth that Mal is bursting
through your subconscious.</font>

951
01:15:46,457 --> 01:15:48,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the truth that,
as we go deeper into Fischer...</font>

952
01:15:49,043 --> 01:15:50,836
<font color="#FFFFFF">we're also going deeper into you.</font>

953
01:15:51,671 --> 01:15:54,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'm not sure
we're gonna like what we find.</font>

954
01:15:58,970 --> 01:16:00,429
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were working together.</font>

955
01:16:00,596 --> 01:16:04,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were exploring the concept
of a dream within a dream.</font>

956
01:16:04,475 --> 01:16:05,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">I kept pushing things.</font>

957
01:16:05,894 --> 01:16:09,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanted to go deeper and deeper.
I wanted to go further.</font>

958
01:16:10,064 --> 01:16:14,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just didn't understand the concept that
hours could turn into years down there...</font>

959
01:16:15,112 --> 01:16:17,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">that we could get trapped so deep...</font>

960
01:16:18,657 --> 01:16:21,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">that when we wound up on the shore
of our own subconscious...</font>

961
01:16:22,577 --> 01:16:25,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">we lost sight of what was real.</font>

962
01:16:31,168 --> 01:16:33,753
<font color="#FFFFFF">We created.
We built the world for ourselves.</font>

963
01:16:35,381 --> 01:16:37,382
<font color="#FFFFFF">We did that for years.</font>

964
01:16:38,510 --> 01:16:40,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">We built our own world.</font>

965
01:16:41,846 --> 01:16:43,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long were you stuck there?</font>

966
01:16:44,724 --> 01:16:46,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something like 50 years.</font>

967
01:16:50,229 --> 01:16:51,396
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus.</font>

968
01:16:53,692 --> 01:16:55,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">How could you stand it?</font>

969
01:16:55,193 --> 01:16:57,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">It wasn't so bad at first,
feeling like gods.</font>

970
01:16:58,113 --> 01:17:01,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">The problem was knowing
that none of it was real.</font>

971
01:17:01,323 --> 01:17:05,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eventually, it just became impossible
for me to live like that.</font>

972
01:17:05,871 --> 01:17:07,287
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what about for her?</font>

973
01:17:10,750 --> 01:17:14,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">She had locked something away,
something deep inside her.</font>

974
01:17:16,046 --> 01:17:21,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">A truth that she had once known,
but chose to forget.</font>

975
01:17:24,221 --> 01:17:26,724
<font color="#FFFFFF">Limbo became her reality.</font>

976
01:17:28,059 --> 01:17:29,894
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened when you woke up?</font>

977
01:17:30,395 --> 01:17:34,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, to wake up from that
after years, after decades...</font>

978
01:17:35,149 --> 01:17:39,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">to become old souls thrown back
into youth like that?</font>

979
01:17:40,572 --> 01:17:44,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew something was wrong with her.
She just wouldn't admit it.</font>

980
01:17:45,702 --> 01:17:47,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eventually, she told me the truth.</font>

981
01:17:48,412 --> 01:17:51,748
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was possessed by an idea.</font>

982
01:17:51,917 --> 01:17:57,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">This one very simple idea
that changed everything.</font>

983
01:17:58,756 --> 01:18:01,257
<font color="#FFFFFF">That our world wasn't real.</font>

984
01:18:02,176 --> 01:18:06,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">That she needed to wake up
to come back to reality...</font>

985
01:18:06,972 --> 01:18:09,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">that in order to get back home...</font>

986
01:18:10,601 --> 01:18:12,394
<font color="#FFFFFF">we had to kill ourselves.</font>

987
01:18:19,027 --> 01:18:22,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What about your children?
- She thought they were projections...</font>

988
01:18:22,655 --> 01:18:25,658
<font color="#FFFFFF">that our real children were waiting
for us up there somewhere.</font>

989
01:18:25,824 --> 01:18:27,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm their mother!
Calm down.</font>

990
01:18:27,702 --> 01:18:28,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can tell the difference.</font>

991
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:31,454
<font color="#FFFFFF">If this is my dream,
why can't I control this?</font>

992
01:18:31,622 --> 01:18:33,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't know you're dreaming!</font>

993
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:35,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was certain
there was nothing I could do...</font>

994
01:18:35,877 --> 01:18:39,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">no matter how much I begged,
no matter how much I pleaded.</font>

995
01:18:42,676 --> 01:18:45,719
<font color="#FFFFFF">She wanted to do it,
but she could not do it alone.</font>

996
01:18:45,886 --> 01:18:52,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">She loved me too much, so she came up
with a plan on our anniversary.</font>

997
01:19:18,461 --> 01:19:21,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sweetheart, what are you doing?
- Join me.</font>

998
01:19:21,422 --> 01:19:25,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just... Just step back inside. All right?
Just step back inside now, come on.</font>

999
01:19:25,844 --> 01:19:30,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. I'm going to jump,
and you're coming with me.</font>

1000
01:19:30,472 --> 01:19:32,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I'm not.</font>

1001
01:19:32,350 --> 01:19:34,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, you listen to me.</font>

1002
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:39,273
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you jump, you're not gonna wake up,
remember? You're gonna die.</font>

1003
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:41,358
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, just step back inside.</font>

1004
01:19:41,525 --> 01:19:44,278
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on. Step back inside
so we can talk about this.</font>

1005
01:19:44,445 --> 01:19:46,363
<font color="#FFFFFF">We've talked enough.</font>

1006
01:19:48,449 --> 01:19:50,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mal.
- Come out onto the ledge...</font>

1007
01:19:50,284 --> 01:19:52,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">or I'll jump right now.
- Okay.</font>

1008
01:19:57,250 --> 01:19:59,042
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna talk about this.</font>

1009
01:19:59,918 --> 01:20:01,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right?</font>

1010
01:20:01,253 --> 01:20:06,341
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm asking you to take a leap of faith.
- No, honey.</font>

1011
01:20:07,301 --> 01:20:10,304
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I can't. You know I can't do that.</font>

1012
01:20:10,471 --> 01:20:13,222
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take a second, think about our children.</font>

1013
01:20:13,390 --> 01:20:15,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">Think about James.</font>

1014
01:20:15,894 --> 01:20:17,519
<font color="#FFFFFF">Think about Phillipa, now.</font>

1015
01:20:17,686 --> 01:20:20,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I go without you,
they'll take them away anyway.</font>

1016
01:20:20,774 --> 01:20:24,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What does that mean?
- I filed a letter with our attorney...</font>

1017
01:20:24,527 --> 01:20:27,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">explaining how I'm fearful
for my safety.</font>

1018
01:20:30,074 --> 01:20:32,242
<font color="#FFFFFF">How you've threatened to kill me.</font>

1019
01:20:35,037 --> 01:20:37,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why did you do this?
- I love you, Dom.</font>

1020
01:20:37,832 --> 01:20:39,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why did...? Why would you do this to me?</font>

1021
01:20:39,751 --> 01:20:42,627
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've freed you from the guilt
of choosing to leave them.</font>

1022
01:20:42,796 --> 01:20:45,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're going home to our real children.</font>

1023
01:20:46,006 --> 01:20:49,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no, no, no, Mal, you listen to me,
all right? Mal, look at me, please?</font>

1024
01:20:49,802 --> 01:20:51,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're waiting for a train.</font>

1025
01:20:51,595 --> 01:20:55,181
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mal, goddamn it, don't do this!
- A train that will take you far away.</font>

1026
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:57,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">James and Phillipa are waiting for you!</font>

1027
01:20:57,519 --> 01:21:01,354
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know where you hope this train
will take you, but you can't know for sure.</font>

1028
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:03,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mal, look at me!
- But it doesn't matter.</font>

1029
01:21:03,899 --> 01:21:07,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Mal, goddamn it! Mal, listen to me!
- Because you'll be together.</font>

1030
01:21:07,278 --> 01:21:11,114
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sweetheart! Look at me! Mal, no!</font>

1031
01:21:11,282 --> 01:21:12,699
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus Christ!</font>

1032
01:21:16,203 --> 01:21:19,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">She had herself declared sane
by three different psychiatrists.</font>

1033
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:24,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">It made it impossible for me to try
to explain the nature of her madness.</font>

1034
01:21:24,462 --> 01:21:25,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I ran.</font>

1035
01:21:27,548 --> 01:21:29,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right now, or never, Cobb.</font>

1036
01:21:36,140 --> 01:21:40,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">James! Phillipa! Come on in! Come on!</font>

1037
01:21:41,061 --> 01:21:42,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, let's go.</font>

1038
01:21:42,646 --> 01:21:46,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">I left my children behind and I've been
trying to buy my way back ever since.</font>

1039
01:21:47,025 --> 01:21:50,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your guilt defines her.
It's what powers her.</font>

1040
01:21:51,072 --> 01:21:54,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you are not responsible
for the idea that destroyed her.</font>

1041
01:21:55,618 --> 01:21:58,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">And if we are gonna succeed in this...</font>

1042
01:21:58,328 --> 01:22:03,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">you have to forgive yourself,
and you're gonna have to confront her.</font>

1043
01:22:03,501 --> 01:22:05,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you don't have to do that alone.</font>

1044
01:22:05,502 --> 01:22:07,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, you're not...
- I'm doing it for the others.</font>

1045
01:22:08,422 --> 01:22:13,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because they have no idea the risk
they've taken coming down here with you.</font>

1046
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:20,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">We have to move.</font>

1047
01:22:20,268 --> 01:22:21,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">Time's up.</font>

1048
01:22:21,853 --> 01:22:24,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. I don't know any combination.</font>

1049
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:27,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Not consciously, anyway.
How about instinctively, huh?</font>

1050
01:22:28,025 --> 01:22:31,987
<font color="#FFFFFF">I got somebody in your father's office
right now ready to tap in the combination.</font>

1051
01:22:32,154 --> 01:22:35,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me the first six numbers
that come to your head right now.</font>

1052
01:22:35,199 --> 01:22:37,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I have no idea.
- Right now!</font>

1053
01:22:37,618 --> 01:22:39,869
<font color="#FFFFFF">I said, right now! Right now!</font>

1054
01:22:40,037 --> 01:22:43,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">Five, two, eight, four, nine, one.</font>

1055
01:22:47,796 --> 01:22:49,796
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll have to do better than that.</font>

1056
01:22:49,963 --> 01:22:53,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. Bag them.
You're going for a ride.</font>

1057
01:22:57,680 --> 01:23:01,809
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're worth more to you alive.
You hear me?</font>

1058
01:23:07,064 --> 01:23:08,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">What'd you get?</font>

1059
01:23:08,983 --> 01:23:11,527
<font color="#FFFFFF">Relationship with his father
is worse than we imagined.</font>

1060
01:23:11,694 --> 01:23:12,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">This helps us how?</font>

1061
01:23:12,904 --> 01:23:15,988
<font color="#FFFFFF">The stronger the issues,
the more powerful the catharsis.</font>

1062
01:23:17,199 --> 01:23:20,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How are we gonna reconcile them?
- I'm working on that.</font>

1063
01:23:20,453 --> 01:23:23,997
<font color="#FFFFFF">Work faster.
The projections are closing in quick.</font>

1064
01:23:24,164 --> 01:23:27,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">We gotta break out of here
before we're totally boxed in.</font>

1065
01:24:02,828 --> 01:24:03,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">Damn it.</font>

1066
01:24:04,037 --> 01:24:07,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">You mustn't be afraid to dream
a little bigger, darling.</font>

1067
01:24:23,807 --> 01:24:26,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">We need to shift his animosity
from his father to his godfather.</font>

1068
01:24:26,978 --> 01:24:30,980
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Destroy his one positive relationship?
- No, repair his relationship with his father...</font>

1069
01:24:31,149 --> 01:24:33,483
<font color="#FFFFFF">whilst exposing his godfather's
true nature.</font>

1070
01:24:33,650 --> 01:24:36,653
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should charge Fischer a lot more
than Saito for this job.</font>

1071
01:24:36,820 --> 01:24:39,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">His security is gonna
get worse as we go deeper.</font>

1072
01:24:39,323 --> 01:24:41,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I think we run with Mr. Charles.
- No.</font>

1073
01:24:42,243 --> 01:24:43,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's Mr. Charles?
- Bad idea.</font>

1074
01:24:43,828 --> 01:24:47,372
<font color="#FFFFFF">The second we get into that hotel
his security's gonna be all over us.</font>

1075
01:24:47,539 --> 01:24:49,666
<font color="#FFFFFF">We run with Mr. Charles
like on the Stein job.</font>

1076
01:24:49,833 --> 01:24:52,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You've done it before?
Yeah, and it didn't work.</font>

1077
01:24:52,337 --> 01:24:55,838
<font color="#FFFFFF">The subject realized he was dreaming
and his subconscious tore us to pieces.</font>

1078
01:24:56,006 --> 01:24:58,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">Excellent. But you learned a lot, right?</font>

1079
01:24:58,176 --> 01:25:00,301
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I need some kind of distraction.
No problem.</font>

1080
01:25:00,470 --> 01:25:02,679
<font color="#FFFFFF">How about a lovely lady
that I've used before?</font>

1081
01:25:02,846 --> 01:25:04,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen to me.
You drive carefully, all right?</font>

1082
01:25:05,057 --> 01:25:07,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything down there is
gonna be unstable as hell.</font>

1083
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:15,442
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't jump too soon. We only got
one shot at that kick. We gotta make it.</font>

1084
01:25:15,609 --> 01:25:18,904
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll play the music to let you know
it's coming. The rest is on you.</font>

1085
01:25:19,072 --> 01:25:20,863
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You ready?
- Ready!</font>

1086
01:25:22,115 --> 01:25:23,199
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sweet dreams.</font>

1087
01:25:23,368 --> 01:25:25,284
<font color="#FFFFFF">Am I boring you?</font>

1088
01:25:26,578 --> 01:25:29,789
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was telling you my story.
I guess it wasn't to your liking.</font>

1089
01:25:31,626 --> 01:25:34,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, I have a lot on my mind.</font>

1090
01:25:35,837 --> 01:25:37,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">There goes Mr. Charles.</font>

1091
01:25:42,136 --> 01:25:44,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Fischer, right?</font>

1092
01:25:44,930 --> 01:25:48,432
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pleasure to see you again.
Rod Green from marketing. L...</font>

1093
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:49,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hmm.</font>

1094
01:25:49,894 --> 01:25:52,561
<font color="#FFFFFF">- And you must be?
- Leaving.</font>

1095
01:25:55,817 --> 01:25:56,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">In case you get bored.</font>

1096
01:26:02,198 --> 01:26:03,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">Must've blown you off.</font>

1097
01:26:03,740 --> 01:26:06,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is, unless her phone number
really is only six digits.</font>

1098
01:26:08,621 --> 01:26:13,082
<font color="#FFFFFF">Funny way to make friends,
someone stealing your wallet like that.</font>

1099
01:26:17,005 --> 01:26:19,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goddamn it. The wallet alone
is worth at least 500...</font>

1100
01:26:19,506 --> 01:26:20,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">About $500, right?</font>

1101
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:23,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't worry about it.
My people are already on it as we speak.</font>

1102
01:26:23,927 --> 01:26:25,886
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who or what is Mr. Charles?</font>

1103
01:26:26,096 --> 01:26:29,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a gambit designed to turn Fischer
against his own subconscious.</font>

1104
01:26:29,934 --> 01:26:31,268
<font color="#FFFFFF">And why don't you approve?</font>

1105
01:26:31,435 --> 01:26:33,436
<font color="#FFFFFF">It involves telling the mark
that he's dreaming...</font>

1106
01:26:33,604 --> 01:26:35,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">which involves attracting
a lot of attention to us.</font>

1107
01:26:35,939 --> 01:26:38,859
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Didn't Cobb say never to do that?
- Hmm.</font>

1108
01:26:39,027 --> 01:26:40,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">So now you've noticed how much time...</font>

1109
01:26:40,944 --> 01:26:43,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cobb spends doing things
he says never to do.</font>

1110
01:26:45,323 --> 01:26:47,117
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Saito, can I have a moment?</font>

1111
01:26:47,284 --> 01:26:49,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm sorry, but...
Hold on! Wait!</font>

1112
01:26:51,038 --> 01:26:52,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">You look a bit perkier.</font>

1113
01:26:52,497 --> 01:26:54,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">Very amusing, Mr. Eames.</font>

1114
01:27:01,090 --> 01:27:02,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">Turbulence on the plane?</font>

1115
01:27:02,759 --> 01:27:04,467
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it's much closer.</font>

1116
01:27:04,635 --> 01:27:06,302
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's Yusuf's driving.</font>

1117
01:27:14,645 --> 01:27:17,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">Um, I'm sorry.
Who did you say you were?</font>

1118
01:27:17,273 --> 01:27:19,356
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rod Green from marketing.</font>

1119
01:27:19,524 --> 01:27:21,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">But that's not true at all, is it?</font>

1120
01:27:23,237 --> 01:27:26,698
<font color="#FFFFFF">My name is Mr. Charles.
You remember me, don't you?</font>

1121
01:27:26,908 --> 01:27:28,867
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm the head of your security down here.</font>

1122
01:27:30,161 --> 01:27:32,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out on a different floor,
keep moving.</font>

1123
01:27:32,246 --> 01:27:34,581
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dump the wallet.
Security will be looking for that.</font>

1124
01:27:34,748 --> 01:27:38,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Okay.
- We need to buy Cobb a little more time.</font>

1125
01:27:41,881 --> 01:27:43,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">Security, huh?</font>

1126
01:27:45,885 --> 01:27:48,052
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You work for the hotel?
- No, no.</font>

1127
01:27:48,220 --> 01:27:52,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">I specialize in a very specific type
of security.</font>

1128
01:27:53,225 --> 01:27:54,893
<font color="#FFFFFF">Subconscious security.</font>

1129
01:27:55,060 --> 01:27:57,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're talking about dreams?</font>

1130
01:27:57,354 --> 01:28:00,189
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you talking about, um, extraction?</font>

1131
01:28:01,234 --> 01:28:02,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am here to protect you.</font>

1132
01:28:16,082 --> 01:28:18,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Fischer, I'm here
to protect you in the event...</font>

1133
01:28:18,792 --> 01:28:22,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">that someone tries to access
your mind through your dreams.</font>

1134
01:28:22,337 --> 01:28:24,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not safe here.</font>

1135
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:27,384
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're coming for you.</font>

1136
01:28:45,735 --> 01:28:47,779
<font color="#FFFFFF">Strange weather, isn't it?</font>

1137
01:28:52,618 --> 01:28:53,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">You feel that?</font>

1138
01:28:55,746 --> 01:28:56,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's happening?</font>

1139
01:28:57,081 --> 01:29:00,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cobb's drawing Fischer's attention
to the strangeness of the dream...</font>

1140
01:29:00,501 --> 01:29:03,377
<font color="#FFFFFF">which is making his subconscious
look for the dreamer.</font>

1141
01:29:03,546 --> 01:29:06,590
<font color="#FFFFFF">For me. Quick, give me a kiss.</font>

1142
01:29:11,595 --> 01:29:15,472
<font color="#FFFFFF">- They're still looking at us.
- Yeah, it was worth a shot.</font>

1143
01:29:16,141 --> 01:29:18,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should probably get out of here.</font>

1144
01:29:33,451 --> 01:29:37,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">You feel that? You've actually
been trained for this, Mr. Fischer.</font>

1145
01:29:37,203 --> 01:29:41,207
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pay attention to the strangeness
of the weather, the shift in gravity.</font>

1146
01:29:41,375 --> 01:29:44,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">None of this is real. You're in a dream.</font>

1147
01:29:49,341 --> 01:29:51,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, the easiest way
for you to test yourself...</font>

1148
01:29:51,801 --> 01:29:55,846
<font color="#FFFFFF">is to try and remember how you arrived
at this hotel. Can you do that?</font>

1149
01:29:56,681 --> 01:29:57,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I...</font>

1150
01:29:58,141 --> 01:30:00,644
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, breathe, breathe.
Remember your training.</font>

1151
01:30:02,688 --> 01:30:06,024
<font color="#FFFFFF">Accept the fact that you're in a dream,
and I'm here to protect you. Go on.</font>

1152
01:30:08,027 --> 01:30:09,402
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mm-hm.</font>

1153
01:30:12,198 --> 01:30:14,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're not real?
- No.</font>

1154
01:30:14,199 --> 01:30:17,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. I'm a projection
of your subconscious.</font>

1155
01:30:17,744 --> 01:30:19,828
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was sent here to protect you
in the event...</font>

1156
01:30:19,997 --> 01:30:22,916
<font color="#FFFFFF">that extractors
tried to pull you into a dream.</font>

1157
01:30:23,083 --> 01:30:26,336
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I believe that's what's
going on right now, Mr. Fischer.</font>

1158
01:30:27,421 --> 01:30:28,462
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

1159
01:30:28,631 --> 01:30:29,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

1160
01:30:30,632 --> 01:30:31,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay.</font>

1161
01:30:34,679 --> 01:30:36,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can you get me out of here?</font>

1162
01:30:37,597 --> 01:30:40,182
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right away. Follow me.</font>

1163
01:30:54,407 --> 01:30:55,739
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold on a second.</font>

1164
01:31:00,704 --> 01:31:02,538
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus Christ! What are you doing?</font>

1165
01:31:02,707 --> 01:31:04,957
<font color="#FFFFFF">These men were sent here
to abduct you, all right?</font>

1166
01:31:05,126 --> 01:31:07,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you want my help,
you have to remain calm.</font>

1167
01:31:09,421 --> 01:31:11,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need you to work with me, Mr. Fischer.</font>

1168
01:31:23,435 --> 01:31:27,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">If this is a dream, I should just
kill myself to wake up, right?</font>

1169
01:31:27,230 --> 01:31:29,314
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wouldn't do that if I were you,
Mr. Fischer.</font>

1170
01:31:29,483 --> 01:31:32,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">I believe they have you sedated,
and if you pull that trigger...</font>

1171
01:31:33,154 --> 01:31:34,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">you may not wake up.</font>

1172
01:31:35,448 --> 01:31:39,743
<font color="#FFFFFF">You may go into a further dream state.
Now, you know what I'm talking about.</font>

1173
01:31:42,078 --> 01:31:43,747
<font color="#FFFFFF">You remember the training.</font>

1174
01:31:44,914 --> 01:31:46,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">Remember what I said to you.</font>

1175
01:31:47,167 --> 01:31:48,333
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me the gun.</font>

1176
01:32:00,139 --> 01:32:02,765
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This room should be directly below 528?
- Yeah.</font>

1177
01:32:12,109 --> 01:32:13,609
<font color="#FFFFFF">Think, Mr. Fischer, think.</font>

1178
01:32:13,778 --> 01:32:17,613
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you remember
from before this dream?</font>

1179
01:32:17,989 --> 01:32:20,617
<font color="#FFFFFF">There was, um, a lot of gunfire.</font>

1180
01:32:20,784 --> 01:32:23,411
<font color="#FFFFFF">There was rain.</font>

1181
01:32:23,953 --> 01:32:25,537
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uncle Peter.</font>

1182
01:32:25,789 --> 01:32:29,458
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Oh, my God, we've been kidnapped.
- Where were they holding you?</font>

1183
01:32:32,462 --> 01:32:35,756
<font color="#FFFFFF">- They had us in the back of a van.
- That explains the gravity shifts.</font>

1184
01:32:35,966 --> 01:32:38,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're in the back of a van.
Keep going.</font>

1185
01:32:38,176 --> 01:32:40,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">It had something to do with, um...</font>

1186
01:32:41,096 --> 01:32:43,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something to do with a safe.</font>

1187
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:46,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">God, why is it so hard to remember?</font>

1188
01:32:46,393 --> 01:32:49,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like trying to remember a dream
after you've woken up.</font>

1189
01:32:49,270 --> 01:32:50,979
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, it takes years of practice.</font>

1190
01:32:51,148 --> 01:32:53,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">You and Browning have been pulled
into this dream...</font>

1191
01:32:53,734 --> 01:32:56,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">because they're trying to steal
something from your mind.</font>

1192
01:32:56,654 --> 01:33:00,239
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need you to focus and try
and remember what that is.</font>

1193
01:33:00,407 --> 01:33:02,033
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it, Mr. Fischer? Think!</font>

1194
01:33:02,201 --> 01:33:05,953
<font color="#FFFFFF">A combination. They demanded
the first numbers to pop into my head.</font>

1195
01:33:06,122 --> 01:33:08,832
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're trying to extract a number
from your subconscious.</font>

1196
01:33:08,998 --> 01:33:12,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">It can represent anything.
We're in a hotel right now.</font>

1197
01:33:13,587 --> 01:33:16,713
<font color="#FFFFFF">We should try hotel rooms.
What was the number, Mr. Fischer?</font>

1198
01:33:16,881 --> 01:33:19,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">Try and remember for me.
This is very important.</font>

1199
01:33:19,885 --> 01:33:21,219
<font color="#FFFFFF">Five.</font>

1200
01:33:22,179 --> 01:33:24,639
<font color="#FFFFFF">Five, two... It was something,
it was a long number.</font>

1201
01:33:24,806 --> 01:33:26,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's good. We can start there.
Fifth floor.</font>

1202
01:33:27,059 --> 01:33:28,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yep.</font>

1203
01:33:28,269 --> 01:33:32,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">- So do you use a timer?
- No, I have to judge it for myself.</font>

1204
01:33:32,523 --> 01:33:35,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">While you're all asleep in 528,
I wait for Yusuf's kick.</font>

1205
01:33:35,943 --> 01:33:38,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, how will you know?
- His music warns me.</font>

1206
01:33:38,237 --> 01:33:42,198
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then when the van hits the barrier
of the bridge, that should be unmistakable.</font>

1207
01:33:42,365 --> 01:33:45,534
<font color="#FFFFFF">So we get a nice synchronized kick.</font>

1208
01:33:45,703 --> 01:33:48,121
<font color="#FFFFFF">If it's too soon,
we won't get pulled out.</font>

1209
01:33:48,288 --> 01:33:51,541
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if it's too late,
I won't be able to drop us.</font>

1210
01:33:51,708 --> 01:33:55,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, why not?
- Because the van will be in freefall.</font>

1211
01:33:56,046 --> 01:33:58,881
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Can't drop you without gravity.
- Right.</font>

1212
01:34:04,555 --> 01:34:06,764
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're with me. Go on.</font>

1213
01:34:31,081 --> 01:34:32,122
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Charles.</font>

1214
01:34:32,291 --> 01:34:35,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Do you know what that is, Mr. Fischer?
- Yeah, I think so.</font>

1215
01:34:35,418 --> 01:34:37,502
<font color="#FFFFFF">They were trying to put you under.</font>

1216
01:34:37,921 --> 01:34:40,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I'm already under.
- Under again.</font>

1217
01:34:40,173 --> 01:34:42,759
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you mean,
a dream within a dream?</font>

1218
01:34:43,344 --> 01:34:45,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey. I see you've changed.</font>

1219
01:34:45,970 --> 01:34:47,596
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry?</font>

1220
01:34:48,097 --> 01:34:51,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I'm sorry.
I mistook you for a friend.</font>

1221
01:34:52,144 --> 01:34:53,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh.</font>

1222
01:34:53,604 --> 01:34:55,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good-looking fellow, I'm sure.</font>

1223
01:34:56,398 --> 01:34:59,317
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no. That's Fischer's
projection of Browning.</font>

1224
01:34:59,484 --> 01:35:01,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's follow him
and see how he behaves.</font>

1225
01:35:01,528 --> 01:35:03,488
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Why?
- Because how he acts will tell us...</font>

1226
01:35:03,655 --> 01:35:06,990
<font color="#FFFFFF">if Fischer is starting to suspect
his motives the way we want him to.</font>

1227
01:35:07,158 --> 01:35:08,201
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shh.</font>

1228
01:35:12,789 --> 01:35:15,291
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Uncle Peter.
- You said you were kidnapped together?</font>

1229
01:35:15,458 --> 01:35:18,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, not exactly. They already had him.
They were torturing him.</font>

1230
01:35:19,046 --> 01:35:20,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you saw them torture him?</font>

1231
01:35:28,055 --> 01:35:29,889
<font color="#FFFFFF">The kidnappers are working for you?</font>

1232
01:35:30,849 --> 01:35:32,307
<font color="#FFFFFF">Robert.</font>

1233
01:35:32,475 --> 01:35:36,311
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're trying to get that safe open?
To get the alternate will?</font>

1234
01:35:36,729 --> 01:35:40,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fischer Morrow has been my entire life.
I can't let you destroy it.</font>

1235
01:35:41,150 --> 01:35:43,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not gonna throw away
my inheritance.</font>

1236
01:35:43,654 --> 01:35:47,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">I couldn't let you rise
to your father's last taunt.</font>

1237
01:35:48,658 --> 01:35:51,661
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What taunt?
- The will, Robert. That will?</font>

1238
01:35:51,828 --> 01:35:53,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's his last insult.</font>

1239
01:35:53,956 --> 01:35:57,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">A challenge for you to build something
for yourself...</font>

1240
01:35:57,751 --> 01:36:01,546
<font color="#FFFFFF">by telling you you're not worthy
of his accomplishments.</font>

1241
01:36:07,219 --> 01:36:12,597
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What, but that he was, um, disappointed?
- I'm sorry.</font>

1242
01:36:13,975 --> 01:36:17,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">But he's wrong.</font>

1243
01:36:17,813 --> 01:36:20,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can build a better company
than he ever did.</font>

1244
01:36:20,606 --> 01:36:23,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Fischer? He's lying.</font>

1245
01:36:23,193 --> 01:36:25,319
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How do you know?
- Trust me, it's what I do.</font>

1246
01:36:25,487 --> 01:36:28,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's hiding something,
and we need to find out what that is.</font>

1247
01:36:29,449 --> 01:36:32,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need you to do the same thing to him
that he was going to do to you.</font>

1248
01:36:35,413 --> 01:36:39,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll enter his subconscious and find out
what he doesn't want you to know.</font>

1249
01:36:40,752 --> 01:36:42,211
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

1250
01:36:48,217 --> 01:36:49,469
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's out.
- Wait.</font>

1251
01:36:49,636 --> 01:36:51,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whose subconscious are
we going into exactly?</font>

1252
01:36:51,889 --> 01:36:53,221
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're going into Fischer's.</font>

1253
01:36:53,390 --> 01:36:56,059
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told him it was Browning's
so he'd be a part of our team.</font>

1254
01:36:56,225 --> 01:36:58,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's gonna help us break
into his own subconscious.</font>

1255
01:36:58,729 --> 01:37:00,313
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right.</font>

1256
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:02,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">Security's gonna run you down hard.</font>

1257
01:37:02,733 --> 01:37:05,068
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I will lead them on a merry chase.</font>

1258
01:37:05,610 --> 01:37:08,237
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Just be back before the kick.
- Go to sleep, Mr. Eames.</font>

1259
01:37:13,452 --> 01:37:14,659
<font color="#FFFFFF">You good?</font>

1260
01:37:17,831 --> 01:37:19,164
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey. You ready?</font>

1261
01:37:19,332 --> 01:37:22,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, yes. I'm fine. I'm ready.</font>

1262
01:37:35,474 --> 01:37:36,807
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cobb?</font>

1263
01:37:37,475 --> 01:37:39,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cobb? What's down there?</font>

1264
01:37:43,273 --> 01:37:45,899
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hopefully, the truth
we want Fischer to learn.</font>

1265
01:37:46,068 --> 01:37:47,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mean, what's down there for you?</font>

1266
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:26,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you see that?</font>

1267
01:40:44,787 --> 01:40:46,622
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eames, this is your dream.</font>

1268
01:40:46,789 --> 01:40:49,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need you to draw the security away
from the complex, understand?</font>

1269
01:40:50,085 --> 01:40:51,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Who guides Fischer in?
Not me.</font>

1270
01:40:52,045 --> 01:40:54,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I know the route,
everything could be compromised.</font>

1271
01:40:54,672 --> 01:40:57,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I designed the place.
No, you're with me.</font>

1272
01:40:57,384 --> 01:40:58,926
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could do it.</font>

1273
01:40:59,344 --> 01:41:01,804
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right. Brief him on the route
into the complex.</font>

1274
01:41:01,971 --> 01:41:06,141
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Fischer, you'll be going with him.
- All right. What about you?</font>

1275
01:41:06,310 --> 01:41:09,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">You keep this live.
I'll be listening in the whole time.</font>

1276
01:41:09,313 --> 01:41:13,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">The windows on that upper floor are big
enough for me to cover you from that tower.</font>

1277
01:41:13,649 --> 01:41:14,942
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not coming in?</font>

1278
01:41:15,109 --> 01:41:17,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">In order to find out the truth
about your father...</font>

1279
01:41:17,613 --> 01:41:20,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">you're gonna need to break into
Browning's mind on your own.</font>

1280
01:41:21,490 --> 01:41:22,992
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, Fischer!</font>

1281
01:42:18,047 --> 01:42:21,716
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Sound the alarm! Sound the alarm!
- Go, go, go!</font>

1282
01:42:21,885 --> 01:42:23,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">Move!</font>

1283
01:42:24,970 --> 01:42:26,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go!</font>

1284
01:42:41,238 --> 01:42:42,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sod it.</font>

1285
01:42:53,457 --> 01:42:55,126
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hope you're ready.</font>

1286
01:43:03,885 --> 01:43:05,636
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it's too soon.</font>

1287
01:43:12,144 --> 01:43:13,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cobb, do you hear that?</font>

1288
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:17,105
<font color="#FFFFFF">I first noticed it about 20 minutes ago,
I thought it was the wind up here.</font>

1289
01:43:17,606 --> 01:43:20,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I hear it. It's music.</font>

1290
01:43:20,277 --> 01:43:21,694
<font color="#FFFFFF">So, what do we do?</font>

1291
01:43:21,862 --> 01:43:23,279
<font color="#FFFFFF">We move fast.</font>

1292
01:43:28,784 --> 01:43:30,994
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yusuf's 10 seconds from the jump.</font>

1293
01:43:32,872 --> 01:43:35,248
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which gives Arthur three minutes.</font>

1294
01:43:36,167 --> 01:43:38,293
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey!
- That's him!</font>

1295
01:43:38,962 --> 01:43:40,671
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Which gives us what?
- Sixty minutes.</font>

1296
01:43:40,838 --> 01:43:44,132
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Can they make that route in an hour?
- They have to climb to the terrace.</font>

1297
01:43:44,301 --> 01:43:47,136
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then they need a new route,
a more direct route.</font>

1298
01:43:58,355 --> 01:43:59,981
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's designed as a labyrinth.</font>

1299
01:44:00,149 --> 01:44:02,650
<font color="#FFFFFF">There must be access routes
that cut through the maze.</font>

1300
01:44:02,819 --> 01:44:04,403
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eames?</font>

1301
01:44:27,511 --> 01:44:28,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did Eames add any features?</font>

1302
01:44:28,929 --> 01:44:30,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think I should tell you.</font>

1303
01:44:30,555 --> 01:44:32,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">We don't have time for this.
Did he add anything?</font>

1304
01:44:33,307 --> 01:44:34,557
<font color="#FFFFFF">He added an air-duct system...</font>

1305
01:44:34,725 --> 01:44:36,476
<font color="#FFFFFF">that can cut through the maze.
- Good. Explain it to them.</font>

1306
01:45:12,180 --> 01:45:13,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Paradox.</font>

1307
01:46:23,627 --> 01:46:25,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">What was that?
- The kick.</font>

1308
01:46:26,296 --> 01:46:28,171
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cobb! Cobb, did we miss it?</font>

1309
01:46:28,340 --> 01:46:30,048
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, we missed it.</font>

1310
01:46:30,216 --> 01:46:31,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">Man.</font>

1311
01:46:31,592 --> 01:46:35,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">Couldn't someone have dreamt up
a goddamn beach? Huh?</font>

1312
01:46:36,055 --> 01:46:37,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">Uh-huh.</font>

1313
01:46:38,057 --> 01:46:40,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, what the hell do we do now?</font>

1314
01:46:40,393 --> 01:46:42,226
<font color="#FFFFFF">We finish the job before the next kick.</font>

1315
01:46:42,395 --> 01:46:44,479
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What next kick?
- When the van hits the water.</font>

1316
01:47:07,337 --> 01:47:10,797
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you'd like to
make a call, please hang up and try again.</font>

1317
01:47:10,965 --> 01:47:12,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you need help, hang up...</font>

1318
01:47:13,009 --> 01:47:16,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do I drop you without gravity?</font>

1319
01:47:18,847 --> 01:47:21,516
<font color="#FFFFFF">Arthur has a couple minutes,
and we have about 20.</font>

1320
01:47:44,916 --> 01:47:46,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">You okay?</font>

1321
01:47:51,046 --> 01:47:54,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">Run! Turn around!
Move to base! Move to base!</font>

1322
01:47:55,092 --> 01:47:56,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go, go, go!</font>

1323
01:47:58,805 --> 01:47:59,971
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's something wrong.</font>

1324
01:48:00,140 --> 01:48:02,474
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're heading your way,
like they know something.</font>

1325
01:48:03,726 --> 01:48:05,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just buy us more time, all right?</font>

1326
01:48:06,104 --> 01:48:07,938
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Come on!
- On my way.</font>

1327
01:48:08,105 --> 01:48:09,814
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on! Move!</font>

1328
01:49:33,983 --> 01:49:35,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

1329
01:49:47,704 --> 01:49:50,498
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay. That's the antechamber
outside the strong room.</font>

1330
01:49:50,667 --> 01:49:54,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Does the strong room have windows?
- It wouldn't be very strong if it did.</font>

1331
01:49:54,337 --> 01:49:56,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's hope Fischer likes
what he finds in there.</font>

1332
01:49:58,216 --> 01:50:01,551
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are those projections his subconscious?
- Yes.</font>

1333
01:50:01,719 --> 01:50:05,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Are you destroying parts of his mind?
- No. They're just projections.</font>

1334
01:50:31,373 --> 01:50:33,125
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We're here.
- You're clear, but hurry.</font>

1335
01:50:33,292 --> 01:50:35,127
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's an entire army headed your way.</font>

1336
01:51:01,945 --> 01:51:03,322
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm in.</font>

1337
01:51:08,619 --> 01:51:09,744
<font color="#FFFFFF">There he is.</font>

1338
01:51:52,329 --> 01:51:55,039
<font color="#FFFFFF">- There's someone in there.
- Fischer, it's a trap. Get out.</font>

1339
01:51:56,208 --> 01:51:58,793
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on. Come on, a little lower.</font>

1340
01:52:04,509 --> 01:52:05,676
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cobb.</font>

1341
01:52:06,301 --> 01:52:08,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, she is not real.</font>

1342
01:52:09,471 --> 01:52:10,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you know that?</font>

1343
01:52:10,847 --> 01:52:14,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">She is just a projection.
Fischer. Fischer is real.</font>

1344
01:52:18,480 --> 01:52:20,023
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello.</font>

1345
01:52:24,695 --> 01:52:27,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eames!
Eames, get to the antechamber now!</font>

1346
01:53:11,826 --> 01:53:14,703
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened?
- Mal killed Fischer.</font>

1347
01:53:16,956 --> 01:53:18,998
<font color="#FFFFFF">I couldn't shoot her.</font>

1348
01:53:19,667 --> 01:53:23,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no use in reviving him.
His mind's already trapped down there.</font>

1349
01:53:23,212 --> 01:53:24,253
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all over.</font>

1350
01:53:26,006 --> 01:53:27,631
<font color="#FFFFFF">So that's it, then? We failed?</font>

1351
01:53:28,259 --> 01:53:30,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're done. I'm sorry.</font>

1352
01:53:34,306 --> 01:53:36,932
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not me that doesn't get back
to my family, is it?</font>

1353
01:53:37,643 --> 01:53:41,563
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shame. I wanted to know what was
gonna happen in there. I swear we had this.</font>

1354
01:53:41,730 --> 01:53:43,774
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's set the charges.</font>

1355
01:53:45,609 --> 01:53:47,109
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, there's still another way.</font>

1356
01:53:48,404 --> 01:53:51,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">- We have to follow Fischer down there.
- Not enough time.</font>

1357
01:53:51,990 --> 01:53:54,826
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, but there will be enough time
down there.</font>

1358
01:53:55,953 --> 01:53:57,078
<font color="#FFFFFF">And we will find him.</font>

1359
01:53:57,246 --> 01:54:01,166
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, as soon as Arthur's music kicks in,
just use the defibrillator to revive him.</font>

1360
01:54:01,333 --> 01:54:04,252
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can give him his own kick
down below.</font>

1361
01:54:05,253 --> 01:54:06,962
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, you get him in there.</font>

1362
01:54:07,131 --> 01:54:10,007
<font color="#FFFFFF">As soon as the music ends,
you blow up the hospital...</font>

1363
01:54:10,176 --> 01:54:12,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">and we all ride the kick
back up the layers.</font>

1364
01:54:14,180 --> 01:54:18,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's worth a shot, if Saito can hold
the guards off while I set the charges.</font>

1365
01:54:19,101 --> 01:54:21,228
<font color="#FFFFFF">Saito will never make it, will he?</font>

1366
01:54:23,271 --> 01:54:25,731
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Cobb, come on. We've gotta try this.
- Go for it.</font>

1367
01:54:25,899 --> 01:54:28,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you are not back before the kick,
I am gone with or without you.</font>

1368
01:54:28,985 --> 01:54:32,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's right. She's right.
Come on. Let's go.</font>

1369
01:54:36,452 --> 01:54:38,662
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I trust you to do
what needs to happen here?</font>

1370
01:54:38,829 --> 01:54:40,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mal's gonna be down there.</font>

1371
01:54:40,206 --> 01:54:42,623
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know where to find her.
She'll have Fischer.</font>

1372
01:54:42,792 --> 01:54:46,711
<font color="#FFFFFF">- How do you know?
- Because she wants me to come after him.</font>

1373
01:54:46,878 --> 01:54:49,046
<font color="#FFFFFF">She wants me back down there with her.</font>

1374
01:55:15,824 --> 01:55:16,824
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right?</font>

1375
01:55:24,082 --> 01:55:26,751
<font color="#FFFFFF">- This is your world?
- It was.</font>

1376
01:55:27,545 --> 01:55:29,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">And this is where she'll be.</font>

1377
01:55:30,213 --> 01:55:31,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

1378
01:56:18,261 --> 01:56:20,721
<font color="#FFFFFF">Saito. Saito.</font>

1379
01:56:21,181 --> 01:56:25,143
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need you to take care of Fischer
while I go set some charges, okay?</font>

1380
01:56:25,310 --> 01:56:28,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">No room for tourists on these jobs.</font>

1381
01:56:31,399 --> 01:56:32,567
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't be silly.</font>

1382
01:57:05,059 --> 01:57:07,101
<font color="#FFFFFF">You built all this? This is incredible.</font>

1383
01:57:07,603 --> 01:57:09,604
<font color="#FFFFFF">We built for years.</font>

1384
01:57:10,648 --> 01:57:12,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then we started in on the memories.</font>

1385
01:57:19,698 --> 01:57:21,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">This way.</font>

1386
01:58:02,783 --> 01:58:04,868
<font color="#FFFFFF">This was our neighborhood.</font>

1387
01:58:05,036 --> 01:58:07,369
<font color="#FFFFFF">Places from our past.</font>

1388
01:58:07,537 --> 01:58:09,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was our first apartment.</font>

1389
01:58:09,497 --> 01:58:11,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then we moved to that building
right there.</font>

1390
01:58:11,876 --> 01:58:14,418
<font color="#FFFFFF">After Mal became pregnant,
that became our home.</font>

1391
01:58:14,587 --> 01:58:17,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">You reconstructed all of this
from memory?</font>

1392
01:58:17,547 --> 01:58:19,841
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like I told you, we had lots of time.</font>

1393
01:58:20,009 --> 01:58:21,592
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is that?</font>

1394
01:58:23,136 --> 01:58:24,887
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the house Mal grew up in.</font>

1395
01:58:25,055 --> 01:58:27,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Well, will she be in there?
- No.</font>

1396
01:58:27,850 --> 01:58:28,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

1397
01:58:29,018 --> 01:58:32,353
<font color="#FFFFFF">We both wanted to live in a house,
but we loved this type of building.</font>

1398
01:58:32,520 --> 01:58:35,481
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the real world,
we'd have to choose, but not here.</font>

1399
01:59:16,064 --> 01:59:18,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">How are we gonna bring Fischer back?</font>

1400
01:59:18,484 --> 01:59:20,902
<font color="#FFFFFF">We're gonna have to come up
with some kind of a kick.</font>

1401
01:59:21,069 --> 01:59:22,487
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

1402
01:59:23,488 --> 01:59:24,572
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm gonna improvise.</font>

1403
01:59:24,739 --> 01:59:29,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, there's something you should
know about me. About inception.</font>

1404
01:59:42,507 --> 01:59:46,386
<font color="#FFFFFF">An idea is like a virus. Resilient.</font>

1405
01:59:47,220 --> 01:59:48,762
<font color="#FFFFFF">Highly contagious.</font>

1406
01:59:48,930 --> 01:59:52,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the smallest seed
of an idea can grow.</font>

1407
01:59:53,351 --> 01:59:55,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">It can grow to define...</font>

1408
01:59:56,354 --> 01:59:57,939
<font color="#FFFFFF">or destroy you.</font>

1409
02:00:01,068 --> 02:00:03,819
<font color="#FFFFFF">The smallest idea, such as:</font>

1410
02:00:04,445 --> 02:00:06,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">"Your world is not real."</font>

1411
02:00:07,073 --> 02:00:10,827
<font color="#FFFFFF">Simple little thought
that changes everything.</font>

1412
02:00:12,078 --> 02:00:16,582
<font color="#FFFFFF">So certain of your world. Of what's real.</font>

1413
02:00:16,750 --> 02:00:18,542
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you think he is?</font>

1414
02:00:20,337 --> 02:00:23,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or do you think he's as lost as I was?</font>

1415
02:00:24,382 --> 02:00:25,884
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know what's real, Mal.</font>

1416
02:00:27,970 --> 02:00:30,262
<font color="#FFFFFF">No creeping doubts?</font>

1417
02:00:30,972 --> 02:00:33,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not feeling persecuted, Dom?</font>

1418
02:00:33,893 --> 02:00:35,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chased around the globe...</font>

1419
02:00:35,394 --> 02:00:38,061
<font color="#FFFFFF">by anonymous corporations
and police forces...</font>

1420
02:00:38,229 --> 02:00:40,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">the way the projections
persecute the dreamer?</font>

1421
02:00:42,484 --> 02:00:43,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">Admit it.</font>

1422
02:00:45,279 --> 02:00:48,113
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't believe in one reality anymore.</font>

1423
02:00:48,282 --> 02:00:49,823
<font color="#FFFFFF">So choose.</font>

1424
02:00:49,992 --> 02:00:53,328
<font color="#FFFFFF">Choose to be here. Choose me.</font>

1425
02:01:20,104 --> 02:01:21,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what I have to do.</font>

1426
02:01:21,523 --> 02:01:24,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to get back to our children
because you left them.</font>

1427
02:01:25,527 --> 02:01:27,069
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because you left us.</font>

1428
02:01:27,238 --> 02:01:29,029
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You're wrong.
I'm not wrong.</font>

1429
02:01:29,198 --> 02:01:31,240
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're confused.</font>

1430
02:01:32,368 --> 02:01:34,409
<font color="#FFFFFF">Our children are here.</font>

1431
02:01:35,203 --> 02:01:38,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you'd like to see their faces again,
wouldn't you?</font>

1432
02:01:38,623 --> 02:01:41,708
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, but I'm gonna see them
up above, Mal.</font>

1433
02:01:55,349 --> 02:01:57,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Up above?</font>

1434
02:01:58,226 --> 02:02:01,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen to yourself.
These are our children.</font>

1435
02:02:02,398 --> 02:02:03,773
<font color="#FFFFFF">Watch.</font>

1436
02:02:04,274 --> 02:02:05,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">James? Phillipa?</font>

1437
02:02:06,150 --> 02:02:08,569
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't do this, Mal. Please.
Those aren't my children.</font>

1438
02:02:08,737 --> 02:02:11,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">You keep telling yourself that,
but you don't believe it.</font>

1439
02:02:11,407 --> 02:02:13,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">- No, I know it.
- What if you're wrong?</font>

1440
02:02:13,701 --> 02:02:15,993
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if I'm what's real?</font>

1441
02:02:17,203 --> 02:02:19,413
<font color="#FFFFFF">You keep telling yourself what you know.</font>

1442
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,251
<font color="#FFFFFF">But what do you believe?</font>

1443
02:02:24,211 --> 02:02:25,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you feel?</font>

1444
02:02:27,588 --> 02:02:29,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guilt.</font>

1445
02:02:30,216 --> 02:02:32,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">I feel guilt, Mal.</font>

1446
02:02:32,970 --> 02:02:36,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">And no matter what I do,
no matter how hopeless I am...</font>

1447
02:02:37,099 --> 02:02:41,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">no matter how confused,
that guilt is always there...</font>

1448
02:02:41,520 --> 02:02:44,063
<font color="#FFFFFF">reminding me of the truth.</font>

1449
02:02:44,564 --> 02:02:45,856
<font color="#FFFFFF">What truth?</font>

1450
02:02:48,277 --> 02:02:53,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">That the idea that caused you to question
your reality came from me.</font>

1451
02:02:56,909 --> 02:03:00,037
<font color="#FFFFFF">You planted the idea in my mind?</font>

1452
02:03:01,539 --> 02:03:03,041
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is she talking about?</font>

1453
02:03:03,958 --> 02:03:09,212
<font color="#FFFFFF">The reason I knew inception was possible
was because I did it to her first.</font>

1454
02:03:10,256 --> 02:03:13,216
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I did it to my own wife.
- Why?</font>

1455
02:03:13,969 --> 02:03:15,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were lost in here.</font>

1456
02:03:16,387 --> 02:03:21,016
<font color="#FFFFFF">I knew we needed to escape,
but she wouldn't accept it.</font>

1457
02:03:24,229 --> 02:03:29,900
<font color="#FFFFFF">She had locked something away,
something deep inside.</font>

1458
02:03:30,652 --> 02:03:34,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">A truth that she had once known,
but chose to forget.</font>

1459
02:03:35,783 --> 02:03:37,908
<font color="#FFFFFF">And she couldn't break free.</font>

1460
02:03:40,621 --> 02:03:43,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I decided to search for it.</font>

1461
02:03:43,916 --> 02:03:48,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">I went deep into the recess of her mind
and found that secret place.</font>

1462
02:03:48,962 --> 02:03:50,837
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I broke in...</font>

1463
02:03:51,422 --> 02:03:53,591
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I planted an idea.</font>

1464
02:03:54,342 --> 02:03:58,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">A simple little idea
that would change everything.</font>

1465
02:04:03,351 --> 02:04:05,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">That her world wasn't real.</font>

1466
02:04:18,533 --> 02:04:21,702
<font color="#FFFFFF">That death was the only escape.</font>

1467
02:04:29,127 --> 02:04:30,877
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're waiting for a train.</font>

1468
02:04:33,215 --> 02:04:35,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">A train that'll take you far away.</font>

1469
02:04:37,094 --> 02:04:40,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know where you hope
this train will take you...</font>

1470
02:04:41,222 --> 02:04:43,224
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you can't know for sure.</font>

1471
02:04:44,393 --> 02:04:45,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yet it doesn't matter.</font>

1472
02:04:47,395 --> 02:04:50,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Now, tell me why!
- Because you'll be together!</font>

1473
02:04:54,903 --> 02:04:58,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I never knew that that idea
would grow in her mind like a cancer...</font>

1474
02:04:59,115 --> 02:05:01,533
<font color="#FFFFFF">that even after she woke...</font>

1475
02:05:04,412 --> 02:05:06,913
<font color="#FFFFFF">That even after
you came back to reality...</font>

1476
02:05:09,835 --> 02:05:12,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">that you'd continue to believe
your world wasn't real.</font>

1477
02:05:15,591 --> 02:05:17,966
<font color="#FFFFFF">That death was the only escape.</font>

1478
02:05:18,135 --> 02:05:20,802
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mal, no! Jesus!</font>

1479
02:05:20,970 --> 02:05:24,681
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You infected my mind.
- I was trying to save you.</font>

1480
02:05:24,850 --> 02:05:26,266
<font color="#FFFFFF">You betrayed me.</font>

1481
02:05:27,101 --> 02:05:30,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you can make amends.
You can still keep your promise.</font>

1482
02:05:30,939 --> 02:05:33,983
<font color="#FFFFFF">We can still be together, right here...</font>

1483
02:05:34,150 --> 02:05:36,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">in the world we built together.</font>

1484
02:06:57,442 --> 02:06:59,777
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cobb, we need to get Fischer.</font>

1485
02:07:00,654 --> 02:07:01,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't have him.</font>

1486
02:07:02,989 --> 02:07:06,408
<font color="#FFFFFF">- If I stay here, will you let him go?
- What are you talking about?</font>

1487
02:07:10,872 --> 02:07:12,707
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fischer is on the porch.</font>

1488
02:07:13,292 --> 02:07:15,876
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Go check he's alive, Ariadne.
- Cobb, you can't do this.</font>

1489
02:07:16,043 --> 02:07:18,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go check he's alive right now. Do it.</font>

1490
02:07:34,354 --> 02:07:37,439
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's here! And it's time,
but you have to come now!</font>

1491
02:07:37,608 --> 02:07:41,277
<font color="#FFFFFF">You take Fischer with you, all right?
- You can't stay here to be with her.</font>

1492
02:07:43,863 --> 02:07:46,573
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not. Saito's dead by now.</font>

1493
02:07:46,742 --> 02:07:50,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">That means he's down here somewhere.
That means I have to find him.</font>

1494
02:07:52,247 --> 02:07:55,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't stay with her anymore,
because she doesn't exist.</font>

1495
02:07:55,500 --> 02:07:58,918
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm the only thing
you do believe in anymore.</font>

1496
02:07:59,087 --> 02:08:00,421
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

1497
02:08:01,590 --> 02:08:03,006
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish.</font>

1498
02:08:04,592 --> 02:08:07,094
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish more than anything, but...</font>

1499
02:08:08,220 --> 02:08:10,930
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't imagine you
with all your complexity...</font>

1500
02:08:11,099 --> 02:08:13,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">all your perfection,
all your imperfection.</font>

1501
02:08:14,770 --> 02:08:15,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">- You all right?
- Yeah.</font>

1502
02:08:15,936 --> 02:08:17,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at you.</font>

1503
02:08:19,024 --> 02:08:23,944
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're just a shade.
You're just a shade of my real wife.</font>

1504
02:08:24,404 --> 02:08:27,030
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you were the best
that I could do, but...</font>

1505
02:08:27,865 --> 02:08:30,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, you're just not good enough.</font>

1506
02:08:30,452 --> 02:08:32,118
<font color="#FFFFFF">Does this feel real?</font>

1507
02:08:34,497 --> 02:08:37,123
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What are you doing?
- Improvising.</font>

1508
02:08:45,716 --> 02:08:47,426
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no!</font>

1509
02:08:48,386 --> 02:08:50,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">In there, now. Go, go, go.</font>

1510
02:09:35,641 --> 02:09:37,518
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was dis...</font>

1511
02:09:39,229 --> 02:09:41,564
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was dis... Disa...</font>

1512
02:09:42,440 --> 02:09:44,984
<font color="#FFFFFF">- I know, Dad.
- Dis...</font>

1513
02:09:50,990 --> 02:09:53,074
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you were disappointed...</font>

1514
02:09:53,868 --> 02:09:55,243
<font color="#FFFFFF">I couldn't be you.</font>

1515
02:09:55,662 --> 02:09:57,162
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

1516
02:09:57,663 --> 02:09:58,872
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no.</font>

1517
02:09:59,916 --> 02:10:01,917
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was disappointed...</font>

1518
02:10:03,670 --> 02:10:05,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">that you tried.</font>

1519
02:10:28,862 --> 02:10:30,529
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

1520
02:10:39,956 --> 02:10:41,081
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, come on.</font>

1521
02:11:11,320 --> 02:11:12,822
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dad?</font>

1522
02:11:51,152 --> 02:11:54,238
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the kick, Ariadne!
You have to go now!</font>

1523
02:12:07,085 --> 02:12:10,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't lose yourself!
Find Saito and bring him back!</font>

1524
02:12:10,671 --> 02:12:12,338
<font color="#FFFFFF">I will!</font>

1525
02:12:52,505 --> 02:12:55,256
<font color="#FFFFFF">You remember when you asked me
to marry you?</font>

1526
02:12:55,425 --> 02:12:56,550
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

1527
02:12:56,717 --> 02:12:59,761
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said you dreamt
that we'd grow old together.</font>

1528
02:13:02,474 --> 02:13:03,974
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we did.</font>

1529
02:13:05,894 --> 02:13:08,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">We did. You don't remember?</font>

1530
02:13:12,943 --> 02:13:15,778
<font color="#FFFFFF">I miss you more than I can bear...</font>

1531
02:13:18,155 --> 02:13:20,157
<font color="#FFFFFF">but we had our time together.</font>

1532
02:13:21,493 --> 02:13:23,577
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I have to let you go.</font>

1533
02:13:25,663 --> 02:13:27,456
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to let you go.</font>

1534
02:14:18,716 --> 02:14:20,009
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, Robert.</font>

1535
02:14:47,662 --> 02:14:51,331
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, the will means that Dad
wanted me to be my own man...</font>

1536
02:14:52,417 --> 02:14:54,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">not just to live for him.</font>

1537
02:14:56,046 --> 02:14:58,588
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what I'm gonna do, Uncle Peter.</font>

1538
02:15:08,349 --> 02:15:09,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">What happened?</font>

1539
02:15:10,060 --> 02:15:11,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Cobb stayed.
- With Mal?</font>

1540
02:15:11,935 --> 02:15:13,186
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, to find Saito.</font>

1541
02:15:15,481 --> 02:15:17,231
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll be lost.</font>

1542
02:15:19,778 --> 02:15:21,612
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, he'll be all right.</font>

1543
02:15:37,628 --> 02:15:39,587
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you come to kill me?</font>

1544
02:15:43,885 --> 02:15:46,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm waiting for someone.</font>

1545
02:15:50,809 --> 02:15:53,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someone from a half-remembered dream.</font>

1546
02:15:56,314 --> 02:15:57,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cobb?</font>

1547
02:15:59,650 --> 02:16:01,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">Impossible.</font>

1548
02:16:01,944 --> 02:16:04,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were young men together.</font>

1549
02:16:06,157 --> 02:16:08,492
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm an old man.</font>

1550
02:16:09,743 --> 02:16:11,787
<font color="#FFFFFF">Filled with regret.</font>

1551
02:16:14,916 --> 02:16:17,626
<font color="#FFFFFF">Waiting to die alone.</font>

1552
02:16:20,796 --> 02:16:22,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've come back for you.</font>

1553
02:16:26,261 --> 02:16:30,096
<font color="#FFFFFF">To remind you of something.</font>

1554
02:16:33,393 --> 02:16:35,769
<font color="#FFFFFF">Something you once knew.</font>

1555
02:16:38,605 --> 02:16:40,858
<font color="#FFFFFF">That this world is not real.</font>

1556
02:16:45,780 --> 02:16:50,283
<font color="#FFFFFF">To convince me to honor
our arrangement?</font>

1557
02:16:51,119 --> 02:16:53,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">To take a leap of faith, yes.</font>

1558
02:16:59,960 --> 02:17:01,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come back...</font>

1559
02:17:03,840 --> 02:17:07,217
<font color="#FFFFFF">so we can be
young men together again.</font>

1560
02:17:10,971 --> 02:17:12,972
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come back with me.</font>

1561
02:17:16,059 --> 02:17:17,477
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come back.</font>

1562
02:17:27,237 --> 02:17:28,947
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hot towel, sir?</font>

1563
02:17:29,574 --> 02:17:32,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll be landing in Los Angeles
in about 20 minutes.</font>

1565
02:17:36,997 --> 02:17:38,332
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

1566
02:17:38,833 --> 02:17:40,459

<font color="#FFFFFF">- No.
- Do you need immigration forms?</font>

1568
02:18:55,826 --> 02:18:56,909
<font color="#FFFFFF">Welcome home, Mr. Cobb.</font>

1569
02:18:58,037 --> 02:18:59,663

1571
02:19:45,542 --> 02:19:46,959
<font color="#FFFFFF">This way.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">James? Phillipa?</font>

1573
02:20:15,323 --> 02:20:16,614
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look who's here.</font>

1574
02:20:22,204 --> 02:20:23,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

1575
02:20:24,372 --> 02:20:27,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">- Hey, guys! Hey! How are you?
Daddy! Daddy!</font>

1576
02:20:27,251 --> 02:20:29,503
<font color="#FFFFFF">Daddy!
How are you?</font>

1577
02:20:30,629 --> 02:20:32,213
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look what I've been building!</font>

1578
02:20:32,380 --> 02:20:36,093
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What are you building?
We're building a house on the cliff!</font>

1579
02:20:36,260 --> 02:20:39,137
<font color="#FFFFFF">On the cliff? Come on, I want you
to show me. Can you show me?</font>

1580
02:20:39,305 --> 02:20:41,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let's go.
Come on, Daddy!</font>
